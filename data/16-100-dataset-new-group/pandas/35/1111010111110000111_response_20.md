## Test Case Analysis
The test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` uses the `from_arrays` method of `MultiIndex` to create an index from a `PeriodIndex` and then retrieves the level values using `_get_level_values`. The intention is to check if all level values are monotonic. However, the test fails with an AttributeError related to the `PeriodEngine` that receives a `NoneType` instead of a `PeriodIndex`.

## Buggy Function Analysis
The `_engine` function uses `weakref` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and then passes it to `_engine_type` to create the engine. However, due to the weak reference handling, an issue arises where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError.

## Bug Cause
The weak reference handling in the `_engine` function is not correctly preserving the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, leading to the `NoneType` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function needs to be revised to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is preserved throughout the engine's usage. This may involve using weak references in a different manner or ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` instance is not prematurely deallocated.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# Updated version of the _engine function
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This corrected version simplifies the `_engine` function by directly passing the `PeriodIndex` instance to the `_engine_type` without using weak references. This approach avoids the weak reference-related issue that caused the bug.
