The bug in the given function is that it is using weakref.ref incorrectly and not passing the weak reference to _engine_type as intended.

The cause of the bug is that the weakref.ref() function returns a weak reference to the object, but it is not being used properly to create a weak reference.

To fix the bug, we should use the weakref.proxy() function to create a weak reference to the object and pass it to _engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we correctly create a weak reference to self and pass it to _engine_type, avoiding the reference cycle.
