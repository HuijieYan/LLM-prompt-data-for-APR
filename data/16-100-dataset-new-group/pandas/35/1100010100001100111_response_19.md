The bug in the provided function is caused by the weak reference not being properly utilized, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex. This bug is related to the issue "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" in the GitHub repository for pandas.

To fix the bug, we need to properly use weak references to avoid the reference cycle. We can achieve this by creating a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object 'self', and then passing that weak reference to the _engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In the corrected version, we create a weak reference to 'self' and pass the weak reference to the _engine_type along with the length of self._values. This ensures that the PeriodEngine receives the intended PeriodIndex and avoids the reference cycle issue.
