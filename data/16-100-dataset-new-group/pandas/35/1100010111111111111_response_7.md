The issue in the buggy function is that it is not correctly creating a weak reference to the 'self' object, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the 'self' object is properly created and passed to the _engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)  # Passing self as an additional argument
```

By passing 'self' as an additional argument to the _engine_type, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly created and passed to the PeriodEngine.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and also satisfy the expected input/output values, passing the failing test case provided.
