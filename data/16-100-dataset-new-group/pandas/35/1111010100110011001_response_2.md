#### The expected output
A corrected function should return an instance of `PeriodEngine` constructed with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`. It should not return a `NoneType` object.

### Analysis
The error message indicates that the function is returning a `NoneType` object, which prevents the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute from being accessed. This suggests that the `_engine_type` method is not being called correctly, resulting in the returned value being `None`.

### Bug cause
The `weakref.ref()` method does not create an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, which causes the returned value to be `None`. This leads to an `AttributeError` when the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute is accessed.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should create an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class using `self` and the length of `self`, rather than returning a weak reference to `self`. This will ensure that the correct type of object is returned.

### The corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
