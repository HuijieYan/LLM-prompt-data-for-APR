The potential error in the provided buggy function is that the weakref is not being used properly. The weakref.ref() function is used to create a weak reference to the 'self' object to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the weak reference is not being used when calling self._engine_type().

The cause of the bug is that without using the weak reference properly, it may still create a reference cycle and lead to memory leaks.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be used when calling self._engine_type(). This can be achieved by dereferencing the weak reference using the .deref() method before passing it to the _engine_type() function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period.deref(), len(self))
```
