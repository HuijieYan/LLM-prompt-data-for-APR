The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class, used to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class with weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and its length as parameters.

The error message indicates an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which is caused by an attempt to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters, it's clear that the `Period` and `PeriodIndex` instances are passed correctly.

The bug is likely caused by the `_engine_type` method not returning a valid object, possibly returning `None` instead of the expected `_engine` instance.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to check the implementation of the `_engine_type` method and ensure it returns a valid object of type `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create _engine object")
    return engine
```

This change ensures that if the `_engine_type` method returns `None`, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate message, alerting the user to the issue.
