To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the PeriodIndex class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained until the engine object is created.

The bug is causing an AttributeError due to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before it should be. This results in the PeriodEngine getting a `NoneType` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference to self until the engine object is created.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Ensure a strong reference to self during the creation of the engine
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Create the engine object with the strong reference to self
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Return the engine object
    return engine
```

By ensuring a strong reference to self during the creation of the engine and then returning the engine object, we can fix the bug and ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until the engine is created.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should resolve the AttributeError issue and ensure that the weak references are properly handled.
