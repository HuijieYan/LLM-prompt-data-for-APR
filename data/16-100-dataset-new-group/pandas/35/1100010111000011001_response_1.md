The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference to `self` in order to avoid a reference cycle. However, the bug is likely caused by the fact that the function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without checking if `self` is still alive. This can lead to a situation where `self` has been deleted, but the weak reference `period` still exists, leading to an error if the method is called on a deleted object.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the weak reference `period` is still alive before using it to create the `_engine` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        return None  # or handle the error in an appropriate way
```

By adding the check `if period() is not None`, we ensure that the weak reference is still alive before using it to create the `_engine` object. This will prevent the function from causing an error when called on a deleted object.
