The issue is related to the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

Potential error locations:
1.  in the `_engine` function, where the weak reference `period` is assigned but not used correctly.
2. In the MultiIndex creation where weak references to PeriodIndex levels are lost.

Cause of the bug:
The `_engine` function is not correctly using the weak reference, causing it to be dropped before it's intended to. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex, leading to the AttributeError during the failing test.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the `_engine` function to prevent it from being dropped prematurely.
2. Review the creation of MultiIndex to ensure weak references to PeriodIndex levels are not lost.

Based on the analysis, the corrected function is provided below:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other class methods and attributes)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Ensure that the weak reference 'period' is maintained throughout the function
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # Store the engine type in a variable
        engine_type._period_weakref = period  # Assign the weak reference to a property of the engine type
        return engine_type
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference 'period' is maintained by assigning it to a property of the engine type. This ensures that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely, resolving the AttributeError during the failing test and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
