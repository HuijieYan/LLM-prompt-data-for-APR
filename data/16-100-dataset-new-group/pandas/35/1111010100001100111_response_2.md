The bug in the `_engine` function is causing weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This leads to the error raised in the given GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex does not get dropped prematurely. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function to use a weak reference to the PeriodIndex and then extract the reference when needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we create a weak reference to the `self` object and store it in `period_ref`. Then, we pass `period_ref` to `PeriodEngine` when needed.

This fix ensures that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
