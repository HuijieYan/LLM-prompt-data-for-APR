### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function is the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is a cached read-only property and is used to initialize the engine for the `PeriodIndex` object. The bug in this function is related to the weak reference being passed to `_engine_type` and it seems to be causing a reference cycle issue.

### Potential error locations
The issue might be in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` and in passing `period` to `self._engine_type`.

### Cause of the bug
- The `weakref.ref()` is supposed to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it might not be used properly in this context, leading to a possible reference cycle issue.
- This could likely cause a memory leak.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The fix involves using weak references properly to avoid any reference cycle issues and properly initializing the engine without causing a memory leak.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy()` instead of `weakref.ref()`, we create a weak proxy reference to `self` and avoid the reference cycle issue. This should fix the memory leak and resolve the bug.
