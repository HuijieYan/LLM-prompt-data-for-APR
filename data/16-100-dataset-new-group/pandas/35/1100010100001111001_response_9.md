The buggy function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which indicates that the result of the function should be cached and only computed once. However, it seems like the function is not utilizing the `weakref` properly, which may result in a reference cycle.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly use the `weakref` and ensure that the result is properly cached.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = getattr(self, '_cached_engine', None)
    if result is None:
        result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        self._cached_engine = result
    return result
```

In this corrected version, we use the `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, and then check if the result is already cached in the `_cached_engine` attribute. If it's not cached, then we compute the result using `self._engine_type` and cache it for future use. This ensures that the function computes the result only once and avoids any reference cycle issues.
