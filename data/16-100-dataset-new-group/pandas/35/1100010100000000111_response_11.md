The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it is intended to, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in the error that is described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is retained for the intended duration so that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` with parentheses, we are accessing the original referenced object, rather than the weak reference. This ensures that the weak reference is retained for the intended duration and the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
