### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `NoneType` object has no attribute `view`, which means that the `_engine` method is returning `None`. This is likely due to the `weakref` not being used correctly in the `_engine` method.

### Bug
The `_engine` method is returning None instead of the expected type, which is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Fix
Correctly use the `weakref` to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
