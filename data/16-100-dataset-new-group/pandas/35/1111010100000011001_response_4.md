The buggy function `_engine` takes the parameter `self`, which is an instance of the class `PeriodIndex`.

When analyzing the function, it appears that the intention is to create a weak reference (`weakref.ref`) to the `self` object and then use this weak reference to create and return the `_engine_type` object.

The potential error in the current implementation is that the weak reference is not being properly used. The weak reference `period` is being created but not being used when initializing the `_engine_type` object.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being passed to the `_engine_type` correctly, leading to a potential reference cycle.

To fix the bug, the correct strategy would be to use the weak reference `period` when initializing the `_engine_type` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
