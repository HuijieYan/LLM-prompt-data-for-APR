To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, it seems that the weak reference to `self` is not being handled properly. The issue on GitHub also describes the problem where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function.

Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

By immediately invoking the `_engine_type` with the weak reference `period`, we ensure that it is maintained until the engine is created and returned.

This corrected version should resolve the issue on GitHub and pass the failing test.
