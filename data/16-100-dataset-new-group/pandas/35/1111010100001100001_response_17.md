The buggy function `_engine` is a cache_readonly function that returns an instance of `_engine_type`. It takes a weak reference to the `self` object of type `PeriodIndex` and the length of the period index.

The potential error in this function is related to the weak reference usage. The weak reference `period` is created but it is not used inside the `_engine_type` instantiation. This may result in a reference cycle and potential memory leaks.

To fix this bug, we need to use the weak reference `period` inside the `_engine_type` instantiation to avoid the reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is passed to the `_engine_type` instantiation, which helps to avoid potential reference cycles and memory leaks.
