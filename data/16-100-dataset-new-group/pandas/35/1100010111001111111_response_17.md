The buggy function has a decorator `@cache_readonly` which is supposed to cache the return value of the `_engine` function. However, the issue with weak references is causing the cached value to be `None`, which leads to the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is retained properly so that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Retain a weakref of self to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_cached = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_cached
```
In the corrected version, we explicitly assign the weak reference to `self._engine_cached` to ensure that it is retained.

With this fix, the weak reference to `self` will be retained properly, and the cached value will not be `None`, resolving the issue and causing the failing test to pass.
