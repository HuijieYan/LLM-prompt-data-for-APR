The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference is not being maintained properly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly within the `_engine` function. This can be achieved by using the `weakref.proxy` function to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `self._engine_type`.


Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy`, we create a weak reference to `self` that is properly maintained, ensuring that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference.

The corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
