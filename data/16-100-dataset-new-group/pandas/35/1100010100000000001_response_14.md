The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type` constructor. The intention is to avoid creating a reference cycle, but the implementation is incorrect.

The potential error location is the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. This line is creating a weak reference to `self`, but it should be passed as an argument to the `_engine_type` constructor.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being used correctly. The weak reference should be passed as an argument to the `_engine_type` constructor, but it is instead being returned from the function.

To fix the bug, we should pass the weak reference `period` as an argument to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of returning it from the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
