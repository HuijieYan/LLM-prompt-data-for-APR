The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail. The function is supposed to return the engine type for the `PeriodIndex`, but it seems to be creating a reference cycle and returning the wrong engine type.

The buggy function is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems to be using it incorrectly. This could be causing it to return the wrong engine type for the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be properly created and used to avoid the reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
