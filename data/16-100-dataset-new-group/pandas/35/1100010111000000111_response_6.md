## Analysis
The `_engine` function is using a weakref of `self` to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems like there is a problem with how the weakref is being used and passed to `_engine_type`.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The usage of `weakref.ref(self)` might not be correct, leading to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended.
2. The passing of the weakref to `_engine_type` might not be working as expected.

## Cause of the Bug
The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, resulting in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug fix strategy is to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` does not get dropped prematurely and is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`. This might involve revisiting the usage of weakref or the implementation of `_engine_type`.


## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass the weakly referenced self directly to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we can pass the weakly referenced `self` directly to `_engine_type` without dropping the reference prematurely. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the failing test pass.
