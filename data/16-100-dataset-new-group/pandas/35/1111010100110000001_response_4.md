The problem here is that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` and trying to access the `view` attribute.

The issue is caused by the way the `_engine` function is defined and returning the `_engine_type` object. There is an error in the logic that needs to be fixed to return the correct type of object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to be modified to correctly return the object of type `PeriodEngine` with the right parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, instead of returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, we are explicitly returning `PeriodEngine(period, len(self))`, which should resolve the issue by correctly instantiating the `PeriodEngine` object.
