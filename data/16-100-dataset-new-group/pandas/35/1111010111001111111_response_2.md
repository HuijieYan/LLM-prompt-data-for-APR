To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is used correctly to avoid a reference cycle and prevent the PeriodEngine from receiving a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    ...
    """

    # The corrected _engine function
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected function, `period()` is called to obtain the weakly referenced `self` instead of just the weak reference itself. This ensures that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes as expected.
