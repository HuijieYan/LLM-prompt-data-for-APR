The buggy function `_engine` is a cache read-only function that returns the result of calling `self._engine_type` with the parameters `period` and `len(self)`. The `period` is created as a weak reference to `self`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` `idx` from a `PeriodIndex` and then creates another `MultiIndex` `idx2` from `idx` by getting the level values for each level. 

The failing error message indicates an AttributeError in the `_do_monotonic_check` method when trying to access the view of an object that is a `NoneType`.

The cause of the bug is likely that the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly within the `_engine_type` method, leading to a `NoneType` object being accessed in the subsequent steps.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is being used correctly within the `_engine_type` method and that it does not result in a `NoneType` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` with the parentheses after `period`, we can obtain the referenced object from the weak reference, preventing it from returning a `NoneType` object.
