The bug in the given function is that it is using weakref.ref() incorrectly, which leads to incorrect behavior.

The weakref.ref() function is used to create a weak reference to the object, allowing the object to be garbage collected if there are no other strong references to it. However, in the buggy function, weakref.ref() is being called with 'self' as an argument, which creates a weak reference to the 'self' object. This is not the intended use of weakref.ref() in this context.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to pass the object itself to _engine_type, without creating a weak reference explicitly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
By removing the unnecessary use of weakref.ref(), the corrected function will correctly return the engine type for the given input parameters.
