#### Explanation
The `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class is using the `weakref.ref` incorrectly, which is causing a reference cycle and potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug
We should use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which will avoid creating a reference cycle.

#### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
