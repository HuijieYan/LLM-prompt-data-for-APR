The buggy function `_engine` is causing the test to fail. The `_engine` function uses the `weakref` library to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then tries to return a calculated value using this weak reference and `len(self)`. However, it seems that this approach is not working correctly which causes the failing test. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` being thrown due to a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

To fix this bug, instead of using a weak reference, we can directly access the `self` object and use it to calculate the value to be returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
