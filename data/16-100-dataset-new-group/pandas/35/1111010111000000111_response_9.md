Potential Error Locations:
- The _engine function may be returning None because of the weak reference to self, which is being dropped prematurely causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Explanation of Bug:
The bug is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the PeriodIndex. This leads to an error in the failing test of copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, and it fails to return True as expected.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is not dropped prematurely in the _engine function. We can modify the function to maintain the weak reference of self until it is no longer needed, ensuring that it is available for the PeriodEngine to use.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain the weak reference of self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Instantiate and return PeriodEngine using the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```
In the corrected version, we ensure that the weak reference of self is maintained until it is used to instantiate the PeriodEngine. It checks if the weak reference is not None before creating the PeriodEngine, ensuring that the PeriodEngine receives the proper reference to the PeriodIndex.
