### Bug location
The bug lies in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class.

### Cause of the bug
The `_engine` function is using weak reference incorrectly by calling `weakref.ref(self)` and then trying to use it to instantiate `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This results in an AttributeError due to the weak reference not being used properly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The `_engine` function needs to be modified to correctly initialize the weak reference using the `weakref.proxy()` method.

### The corrected version
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
