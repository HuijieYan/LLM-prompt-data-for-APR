### Analysis
The `_engine` function is a `@cache_readonly` decorator that returns an instance of the `_engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of the PeriodIndex. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `vgetter` method and that `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view'. This means that the `_engine` function is not returning the correct type of object, resulting in the AttributeError.

### Bug Location
The bug is occurring in the return statement of the `_engine` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The `_engine` function is not returning the appropriate type of object, leading to the AttributeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of `_engine_type` with the correct parameters.
2. Check if the weak reference of `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.
3. Confirm that the length of the PeriodIndex is being passed correctly.

### The corrected version of the code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
