The bug in the function `_engine` is causing weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing the failing test to raise an error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the `_engine` function's execution.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` will be maintained and passed to the `_engine_type` function as intended, resolving the issue of weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.

The corrected version of the `_engine` function should now align with the expected input/output values and satisfy the failing test, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
