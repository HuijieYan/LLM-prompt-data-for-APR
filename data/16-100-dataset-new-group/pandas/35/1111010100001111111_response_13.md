The bug in the function `_engine` is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the function `_engine` should be modified to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self._values)
```

This modification ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, preventing it from being dropped prematurely. This should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
