The issue is caused by the weakref not being properly created for the PeriodIndex in the _engine method, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakref is created correctly for the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By invoking the weakref.ref with the parentheses `()`, we are creating a weak reference to the actual object, which should resolve the issue by ensuring that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.
