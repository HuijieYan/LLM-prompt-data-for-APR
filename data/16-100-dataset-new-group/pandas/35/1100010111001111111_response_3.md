To fix the buggy function, we need to update the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference and ensure that the PeriodIndex is not dropped before intended.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The bug is caused by the weak reference not being properly handled, leading to the PeriodIndex being dropped before intended. By using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the self object, we ensure that the reference cycle is avoided and the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

With the corrected version of the function, the failing test should now pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
