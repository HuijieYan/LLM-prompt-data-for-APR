## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None`.

## Error Location
The potential error location is within the `_engine` method, where it creates a weak reference to `self` and passes it to `_engine_type` to create the engine.

## Bug Cause
The weak reference to `self` is being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the lifetime of the engine.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine._weak_period = period  # Store the weak reference in the engine
    return engine
``` 

By storing the weak reference to `self` in the engine, we ensure that it is not dropped prematurely, and the bug causing the AttributeError should be resolved.
