#### Expected result
The corrected function should return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, initialized with a weakref of `self` and the length of the current index.

### Suggestions for fixing the bug
The bug is likely caused by a reference cycle issue when creating the `_engine` object. The weakref should be used to avoid this cycle and prevent memory leaks.

### The source code of the corrected function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
