The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property that seems to be returning an object of type `self._engine_type`. It's using a weak reference to `self` but the way it's being used doesn't seem to be correct.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is testing the behavior of the `PeriodIndex` class when `is_monotonic` is called on its levels.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Using `weakref.ref(self)` without properly using it to access the original object.
2. `self._engine_type` might not be correctly handling the weak reference and length.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being properly used to access the original object, resulting in unexpected behavior when using `self._engine_type`.

To fix the bug:
1. Use the weak reference `period` to access the original object `self`.
2. Make sure `self._engine_type` can handle the weak reference properly and the length is used correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return period()._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected function should properly use the weak reference `period` to access the original object `self` and pass it to `self._engine_type` along with the length of `self`. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
