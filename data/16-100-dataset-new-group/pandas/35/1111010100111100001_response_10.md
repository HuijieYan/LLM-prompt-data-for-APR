The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method that returns an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to `self`. This weak reference should prevent a reference cycle, but it seems that there is an issue with the weak reference or its usage within `_engine_type`, leading to an AttributeError when accessing the weak reference in the `_do_monotonic_check` method.

The AttributeError arises from an attempt to access a 'NoneType' object as an attribute when calling the `self._get_index_values()` method inside the `_do_monotonic_check` method of the `PeriodEngine`. This indicates that `self._engine` is returning `None`, which causes the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that `_engine_type` is correctly constructed and returned by the `_engine` method. The weak reference to `self` may need to be handled more carefully to avoid returning `None`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine")
    return engine
```

By explicitly checking for `None` after creating the engine and raising a ValueError if it is `None`, we can ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid engine instance. This should address the AttributeError issue identified in the failing test.
