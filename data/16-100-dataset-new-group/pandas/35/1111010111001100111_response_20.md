To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped before intended, so that the PeriodEngine receives the PeriodIndex as expected.

The issue seems to stem from the `_engine` method in the PeriodIndex class, where a weak reference to self (`period`) is created and then passed to the `_engine_type` function. However, due to the caching nature of the `_engine` method, the weak reference may not persist as intended.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` method to use a different caching mechanism that ensures the weak reference is maintained. We can use a custom caching approach that allows us to control the lifetime of the cached value explicitly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # Custom caching mechanism using a weak reference dictionary
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine_cache'):
        self._engine_cache = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
        
    if id(self) not in self._engine_cache:
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._engine_cache[id(self)] = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return self._engine_cache[id(self)]
```

In this corrected version, we use a `WeakValueDictionary` to store weak references to the cached engine instances. This ensures that the weak reference to `self` persists as intended. By checking if the weak reference for `self` already exists in the cache, we can avoid unnecessarily re-creating the engine instance.

By making these changes, the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` method should be maintained correctly, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

With this correction, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass as expected.
