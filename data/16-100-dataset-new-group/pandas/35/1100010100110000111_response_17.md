The buggy function `_engine` is causing an AttributeError in the `is_monotonic` method when trying to access the attributes of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`. This results in the PeriodEngine getting a NoneType instead of the expected PeriodIndex, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is retained until the engine is no longer needed. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` in a variable within the `_engine` method, ensuring it stays alive until the engine is no longer in use.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `self._period_ref`, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, and the engine can access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` as intended.

With this fix, the error outlined in the GitHub issue should be resolved, and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
