The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference and pass it to the `_engine_type` object. The error message indicates an `AttributeError`, specifically that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

The cause of the bug is likely that the weak reference, `period`, is not being properly created. This results in the weak reference being `None`, leading to the 'NoneType' error when attempting to access the 'view' attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly created and passed to the `_engine_type` object.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly create the weak reference to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference `period` will be created properly and prevent the 'NoneType' error when calling the 'view' attribute.
