Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to weak referencing in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. It appears that weak referencing is used here to avoid a reference cycle.

The bug seems to be caused by the weak referecing of `self` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained for as long as it is needed. One potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to store the weak reference to `self` as an attribute of the class, so that it is not garbage collected prematurely.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store weak reference to self as an attribute
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` as an attribute of the class, it ensures that the reference is maintained for as long as it is needed, thereby resolving the issue of the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
