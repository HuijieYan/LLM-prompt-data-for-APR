The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. This function is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`.

The potential error location within the function is at the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, where a weak reference to `self` is created. This weak reference is then used as an argument to initialize `_engine_type`.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being used correctly. The purpose of using a weak reference here is to avoid creating a reference cycle, but the weak reference is not being passed to `_engine_type` correctly.

To fix the bug, the correct strategy is to use the weak reference in the initialization of `_engine_type` to avoid creating a reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, a weak reference to `self` is created and then passed to `_engine_type` as `period()`, which returns the referenced object. This ensures that a reference cycle is avoided.
