The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in the error raised when checking for monotonicity in the levels of the MultiIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped before it is intended to be.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

With this correction, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex will not be dropped prematurely, and the issue described in the GitHub post should be resolved.
