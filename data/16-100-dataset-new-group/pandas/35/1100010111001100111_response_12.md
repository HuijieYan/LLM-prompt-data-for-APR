The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by creating a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `self._engine_type`, but the weak reference is not being properly handled, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled and not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to self and pass it to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

This fix should handle the weak reference to `self` properly and ensure that it is not dropped prematurely, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
