The buggy function `_engine` is using the `cache_readonly` decorator and is designed to return an engine type based on the input `self`. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference of `self` that is being passed to `_engine_type`.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to an error when using the engine.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of `self` is properly maintained and utilized within the `_engine` function.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
from pandas import PeriodIndex

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(PeriodIndex(period), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we pass the weak reference `period` to `PeriodIndex` and then use it to create the engine. This ensures that the weak reference of `self` is properly maintained and utilized, resolving the issue with weakrefs being dropped prematurely. This should fix the bug and make the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass as expected.
