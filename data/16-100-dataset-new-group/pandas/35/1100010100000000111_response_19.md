## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, and then passing this weak reference to `_engine_type`. The issue on GitHub suggests that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is the usage of `weakref.ref` and passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it should be, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

In the corrected version, the `self` is passed along with the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.
