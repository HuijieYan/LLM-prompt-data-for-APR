## Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is a cache_readonly function that returns the engine type for the PeriodIndex.
2. The function uses weakref to avoid a reference cycle and then returns the engine type using the weakref.

## Bug:
The bug is in the use of weakref. The weakref is being passed as an argument to the `_engine_type` function, but it should be used to create a weak reference and then accessed using the reference.

## Fix:
We need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly use the weakref to avoid a reference cycle and then return the engine type using the weak reference.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weakref of self.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
