## Fixing the bug
The bug is likely due to the weak reference not being properly maintained, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. To fix this, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and passed to the _engine_type.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
