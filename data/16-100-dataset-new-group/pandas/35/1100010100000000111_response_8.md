## Analysis:
The bug is related to copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, which loses weakrefs. The issue is caused by the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before it is intended to be. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The weakref.ref(self) might not be correctly creating a weak reference to the PeriodIndex.
2. There might be an issue passing the weakref to the _engine_type.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is created and maintained correctly so that it is not prematurely dropped.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function that resolves the bug
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), **self._engine_kwargs)
```

The corrected version adds the **self._engine_kwargs to ensure that all necessary arguments are passed correctly to the _engine_type. This should prevent the weakly referenced PeriodIndex from being dropped prematurely, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
