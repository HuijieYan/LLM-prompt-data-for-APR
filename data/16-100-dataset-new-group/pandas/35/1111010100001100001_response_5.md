The `@cache_readonly` decorator is used to cache the return value of the `_engine` function. However, the function is not designed to take any input parameters, but the runtime values of `self._values` and `self` are being used inside the function. This could be the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the input parameters from the `_engine` function and ensure that it correctly returns the engine type based on the properties of the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In the corrected version, the function does not take any input parameters and instead uses the properties of the `PeriodIndex` object (`self._engine_type` and `len(self._values)`) to return the engine type. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
