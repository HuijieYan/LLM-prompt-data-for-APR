## Analysis
The `_engine` function seems to be creating a weak reference to the `self` object and then passing it to the `_engine_type` function along with the length of the `self` object. However, it looks like the weak reference is not being utilized correctly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Error Location
The error likely occurs in the creation and usage of the weak reference to the `self` object.

## Cause of the Bug
The weak reference to the `self` object is not being used properly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is utilized correctly so that the `PeriodEngine` receives the actual `PeriodIndex` instead of `None`.

## Bug-fixed function
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the self object
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
