The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the weak reference to `self` not being maintained correctly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference to `self` when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Corrected the weak reference to point to the object instead of just the reference
```
The correction involves changing `period` to `period()` to obtain the object instead of the reference, ensuring that the weak reference is maintained correctly.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
