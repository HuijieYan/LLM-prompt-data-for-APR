# The buggy function is using the weakref.ref() incorrectly, which is causing the unexpected output.

# To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object itself, not to its values. Then we can pass this weak reference to the _engine_type.

# Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object itself
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```
