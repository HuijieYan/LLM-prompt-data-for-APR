The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference to `self` to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object, not the object itself. Therefore, when it is passed to `self._engine_type()`, it is not the actual object but a weak reference to it.

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `self._engine_type()`. This can be done using the `weakref.proxy()` function, which returns a proxy to the original object that can be used in most contexts as if it were the original object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy()` to create a proxy to the original object, we can ensure that the object itself is passed to `self._engine_type()` without creating a reference cycle.

With this correction, the buggy function should now pass the failing test.
