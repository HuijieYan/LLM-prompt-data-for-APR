The issue with the current implementation of the `_engine` function is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly handling the weak reference to `self`. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
In the corrected version, we call `period()` to obtain the actual `self` object from the weak reference before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This ensures that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` object instead of a `None` object.

With this fix, the function should now return the expected output and pass the failing test case.
