The issue with the function is that it is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref()`, but then it is passing this weak reference to `_engine_type` when it should be passing `self` instead.

To fix this bug, the function should return `self._engine_type(self, len(self))` instead of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
