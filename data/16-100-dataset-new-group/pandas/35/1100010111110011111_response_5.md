The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely and is accessible to the `PeriodEngine` before it is used. 

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # instantiate the engine type
    return engine_type
```
