The bug in the provided function is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex er dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in the function returning an incorrect value.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex should be maintained so that the PeriodEngine can retrieve the PeriodIndex correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained and passed to the _engine_type, ensuring that the PeriodEngine can retrieve the PeriodIndex correctly. This fix should address the issue posted on GitHub and resolve the bug.
