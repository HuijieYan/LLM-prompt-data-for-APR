The bug in the function `_engine` is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` during the execution of the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. The expected output should be `True`.

The potential error location is in the `_engine` function where the weakref is created. The weak reference to `self` is not handled properly causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` object instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled to avoid being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    def engine_type_ref(ref, length):
        return self._engine_type(ref, length)
    return engine_type_ref(period, len(self))
```

This modification ensures that the weak reference to `self` is handled properly and passed to the `_engine_type` method as intended.

After implementing this change, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
