The buggy function `_engine` is currently using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This behavior is leading to an error when checking `x.is_monotonic` in the provided GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` is being appropriately utilized when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to prevent the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` from being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

By passing `self` along with the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is retained and utilized correctly, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
