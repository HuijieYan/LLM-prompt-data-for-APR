The buggy function is using a cache_readonly decorator, indicating that it is meant to be a read-only property that is cached after it is calculated for the first time.

The input parameters are self._values and self. The self._values is a PeriodArray with values ['2019Q1', '2019Q2'] and type period[Q-DEC], and self is a PeriodIndex with values ['2019Q1', '2019Q2'] and type period[Q-DEC].

The buggy function is attempting to create a weak reference to self and then pass it to self._engine_type along with the length of self.

The bug seems to be that weakref.ref(self) is not used correctly. It should be creating a weak reference to self, but it is being used as if it is still a reference to self.

To fix the bug, we should create a weak reference to self and then extract the reference when needed.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Extract the weak reference when passing to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By creating a weak reference to self using weakref.ref(self), and then extracting the reference using period(), we can avoid the reference cycle issue and fix the bug in the function.
