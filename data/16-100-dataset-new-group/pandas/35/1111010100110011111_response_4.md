To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped before it is intended. 

We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function and handling the weak reference properly. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        
        class WeakReferencePeriodEngine(PeriodEngine):
            def __init__(self, ref, length):
                self._ref = ref
                self.length = length
                super().__init__(ref, length)
        
            def _get_index_values(self):
                return self._ref().values.astype('i8')
        
        return WeakReferencePeriodEngine(period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we create a new class `WeakReferencePeriodEngine` that inherits from `PeriodEngine`. Within this class, we use the weak reference `self._ref` to access the `PeriodIndex` object in the `_get_index_values` method.

This approach ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed, resolving the issue with the weak reference being dropped prematurely.

With this correction, the failing test case is expected to pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
