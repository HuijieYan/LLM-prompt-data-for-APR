To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we can modify the function to properly create an instance of the `_engine_type` class using a weak reference to the `self` object. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

In this corrected version, we are checking if `self._engine_type` exists before creating an instance. If it does not exist, we return `None`, which will prevent the AttributeError that was raised in the failing test.

With this correction, the `_engine` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test.
