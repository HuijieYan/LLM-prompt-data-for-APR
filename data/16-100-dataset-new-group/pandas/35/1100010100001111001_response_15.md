## Bug Explanation
The buggy function is intended to create and return an instance of `_engine_type` using a reference to `self` passed as a weak reference. However, the current implementation does not create a weak reference correctly, leading to a potential reference cycle issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to `self` correctly using the `weakref` module and pass it to `_engine_type`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
