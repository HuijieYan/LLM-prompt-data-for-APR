The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference may be dropped before intended due to which the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in an error when checking for monotonicity in the levels.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference to `self` within a local variable before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self within a local variable
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

With this fix, the weak reference to `self` is stored in the `period` variable before being passed to `_engine_type`. This should prevent the premature dropping of the weak reference and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
