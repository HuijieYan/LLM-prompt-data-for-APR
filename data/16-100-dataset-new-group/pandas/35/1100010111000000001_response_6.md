## Analysis:
The _engine function is using a cache_readonly decorator, which indicates that it is intended to be a read-only property that is cached after the first access. The function is using weakref to create a weak reference to self and then passing it to _engine_type along with the length of self. This suggests that the _engine_type function is responsible for creating an engine instance based on the weak reference and the length of the object.

Potential error locations:
1. Weakref usage: The use of weakref.ref(self) might be causing the weak reference to be broken, leading to unexpected behavior when _engine_type is executed.
2. _engine_type function: The issue might also exist in the _engine_type function, where it might not be handling the weak reference and the length correctly.

Cause of the bug:
The bug could be causing the _engine_instance to be created incorrectly due to a broken weak reference or incorrect handling of the weak reference and length.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to self is created and passed to _engine_type correctly.
2. Verify the _engine_type function to ensure that it handles the weak reference and length properly.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
In the corrected version, the weak reference to self is stored in a variable called period_weakref before passing it to _engine_type. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained and correctly passed to the _engine_type function.
