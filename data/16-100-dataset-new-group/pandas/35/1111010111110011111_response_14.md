### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the AttributeError when the failing test is executed.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not being maintained properly, leading to a `None` object being passed to the `PeriodEngine`, causing the AttributeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object should be maintained throughout the execution to ensure that it is not unexpectedly dropped before intended.

### Bug Fixed Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    Parameters

    """

    @property
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Maintain a weak reference of self to avoid it being unexpectedly dropped
        if not hasattr(self, '_weakref'):
            self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference of `self` is maintained within the `PeriodIndex` class to ensure that it is not unexpectedly dropped, thus preventing the `None` object from being passed to the `PeriodEngine`. This should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass as expected.
