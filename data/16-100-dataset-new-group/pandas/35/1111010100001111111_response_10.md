To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that we pass a weak reference of the `self` object to the `_engine_type` function. This is important to avoid a reference cycle and ensure that the `_engine_type` function receives a valid reference to `self`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Use weakref.ref to create a weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which ensures that the `_engine_type` function receives a valid weak reference of the `self` object.

By implementing this fix, the issue reported in the GitHub thread titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" should be resolved.
