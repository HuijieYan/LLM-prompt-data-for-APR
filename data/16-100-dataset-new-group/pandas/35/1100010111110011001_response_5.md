The buggy function `_engine` is a method that is a part of a class. It is using a `@cache_readonly` decorator which suggests it is intended to be a cached read-only property.

In the failing test, the function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all the levels in `idx2` are monotonic.

The error message indicates that during the `is_monotonic` check, an AttributeError is being raised because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_engine` method is returning a 'NoneType' instead of the expected type, which causes the error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method is returning the correct type and not a 'NoneType'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is not None:  # Check if the engine_type is not None
        return engine_type
    else:
        # Handle the case where engine_type is None
        raise ValueError("Engine type cannot be None")
```

By adding a check to ensure that the `engine_type` is not None before returning it, we can prevent the 'NoneType' object AttributeError from occurring during the test execution. This should fix the bug and the function should now return the correct type, allowing the test to pass.
