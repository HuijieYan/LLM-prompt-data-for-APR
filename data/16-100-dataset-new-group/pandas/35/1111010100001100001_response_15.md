The buggy function is the `_engine` function inside the `PeriodIndex` class. The purpose of this function is to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of the current `PeriodIndex`.

The potential error in the buggy function is with the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. The weak reference to `self` might not be valid when used in `_engine_type`.

The cause of the bug is that a weak reference to `self` is being used in a way that might lead to a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, the use of `weakref.ref(self)` should be avoided, and a strong reference to `self` should be used instead.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type` without using `weakref.ref`, the bug is fixed. This ensures that a strong reference to `self` is used to create the `_engine` instance.
