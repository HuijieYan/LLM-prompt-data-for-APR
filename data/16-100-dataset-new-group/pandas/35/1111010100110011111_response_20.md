## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with buggy class, corresponding error message, the expected input/output values, the GitHub issue.

The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` class.

The corresponding error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected instance of `_engine_type`.

The expected input/output values for this function are not explicitly specified, but it is expected that the function returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` class.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where weakly referenced objects are being dropped before intended, resulting in an error when accessing attributes.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations within the `_engine` function include the weak reference creation `period = weakref.ref(self)` and the return statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the provided information

The cause of the bug is likely related to the weak reference handling within the `_engine` function. The weak reference to `self` is created, but it appears that the weak reference is not properly retained, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned by the function. This causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute of the `NoneType` object.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the weak reference handling within the `_engine` function needs to be reviewed. It may be necessary to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly retained and used when creating the instance of `_engine_type`. 

Potential strategies for fixing the bug may include:
1. Ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is kept alive during the lifetime of the `_engine` function.
2. Verifying that the weak reference is correctly passed to the `engine_type` constructor.
3. Handling potential issues related to weak references being dropped prematurely.

## A corrected version of the function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self to ensure it is not prematurely garbage collected
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the `_engine` function uses a strong reference `period = self` instead of a weak reference. This ensures that the `self` object will not be prematurely garbage collected, and the correct instance of `_engine_type` can be returned.
