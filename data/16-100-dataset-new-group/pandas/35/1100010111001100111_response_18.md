The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it is intended to, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return result
```

In this corrected version, we store the weak reference to `self` in the variable `period` and then pass it to `_engine_type`. By returning `result` instead of directly returning the output of `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
