The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, initialized with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and the length of the object.

Based on the provided runtime values and types, we can see that the self._values is a PeriodArray containing two period strings, and self is a PeriodIndex object with the same two period strings.

However, the bug lies in the fact that the `_engine_type` class is not correctly initialized with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and the length of the object.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly initialize the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and the length of the object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```
In the corrected version, we pass `len(self._data)` as the length parameter to the `_engine_type` class, assuming that `self._data` contains the period data required for initializing the `_engine_type` class.
