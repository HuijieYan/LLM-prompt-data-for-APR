The buggy function `_engine` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`. This error occurs when the `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` line is executed.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The weak reference `period` might be dropped before intended, leading to the `NoneType` error in the engine.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self) if period is not None else 0)
```

By adding a conditional check to ensure that `period` is not `None`, we can prevent the `NoneType` error. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub description as well.
