The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to itself and then use that weak reference to call another method `_engine_type`. However, the error message shows that the weak reference is not being created properly, resulting in a `NoneType` object with no attribute 'view'.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect creation of the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function, leading to the `NoneType` error when accessing the weak reference.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be created using the `weakref` module properly. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` creates the weak reference properly.

This fix will ensure that the weak reference to `self` is created correctly, and it should resolve the `NoneType` error encountered in the failing test.
