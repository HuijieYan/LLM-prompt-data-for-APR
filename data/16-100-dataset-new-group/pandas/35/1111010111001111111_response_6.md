Based on the description of the bug and the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the weakref being dropped before it is intended. This results in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex, causing the error.

To fix this bug, the _engine function should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self is no longer available")
```

This modification ensures that the weak reference to self is checked before creating the PeriodEngine, and if the weak reference still exists, it is used to create the engine. If the weak reference is no longer available, a ValueError is raised.

With this modification, the weakref to the PeriodIndex will be maintained until it is no longer needed, preventing the PeriodEngine from receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
