## Explanation
The `_engine` function is using weakref to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly. In this case, the weak reference `period` is not being accessed properly when creating the `_engine_type` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by properly dereferencing the weak reference `period` before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, dereference the weak reference and pass it to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
