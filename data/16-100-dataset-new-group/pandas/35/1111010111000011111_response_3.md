To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we can modify it to use a weak reference properly to prevent the reference cycle.

First, we need to modify the buggy function to use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. This will ensure that the weak reference does not disappear prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained until the `_engine` of the `PeriodIndex` is no longer needed.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes without any errors.
