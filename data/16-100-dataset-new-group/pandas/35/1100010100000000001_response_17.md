The buggy function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which is intended to cache the result of the function so that it is only computed once and then reused on subsequent calls. 

The potential error location within the buggy function is the use of `weakref.ref(self)`, as this is not the correct way to create a weak reference in Python.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being properly created, and as a result, it may not prevent a reference cycle as intended.

To fix the bug, we should use the `weakref.proxy` function to create a weak reference to `self` instead of `weakref.ref`. This will ensure that the weak reference is properly created.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
