In the provided code, the `_engine` function uses weak reference to avoid a reference cycle and then returns the result of the `_engine_type` method called with the weak reference and the length of `self`. However, the error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` due to the weak reference being dropped prematurely.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` should be maintained until the `_engine_type` method is called. This can be achieved by using a strong reference to the weak reference object before calling the `_engine_type` method. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_index = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_index, len(self))
```

By maintaining a strong reference to the weak reference object before calling the `_engine_type` method, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected `PeriodIndex`.

This fix should resolve the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes as expected.
