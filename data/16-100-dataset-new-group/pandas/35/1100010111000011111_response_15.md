To fix the bug in the _engine function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained until the _engine_type function is called. In the current implementation, the weak reference to self is being overwritten by the result of weakref.ref(self), which leads to the weak reference being dropped before it is intended.

We can fix this by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the object and then passing that weak reference to the _engine_type function. This way, the weak reference will persist until it is used in _engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an attribute of the object
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to self will be maintained until it is passed to the _engine_type function, resolving the issue with losing weakrefs and ensuring that the test_get_level_values_when_periods test passes as expected.
