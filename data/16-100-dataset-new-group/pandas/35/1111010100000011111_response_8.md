The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` parameter. This weak reference is then used to initialize the `_engine_type`.

The bug is occurring when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` remains available for the `_engine_type` initialization.

Given the explanation, the corrected version of the function would be:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
By directly passing the `self` instead of creating a weak reference, we can ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is available for the `_engine_type` initialization, resolving the bug.
