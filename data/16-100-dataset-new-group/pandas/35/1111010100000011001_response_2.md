#### The cause of the bug
The buggy function `_engine` is using the `weakref.ref` function incorrectly. The `weakref.ref` function is used to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is assigned to a variable `period` without preserving the reference. This causes the weak reference to be immediately garbage collected, leading to potential issues when it is used later.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference created by `weakref.ref` in a class attribute to ensure that the reference is preserved. We can then use this stored weak reference when it is needed in the `_engine` function.

#### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self in a class attribute
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```
