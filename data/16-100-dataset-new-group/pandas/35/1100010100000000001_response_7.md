The buggy function is a method within a class, and it is supposed to return the engine type based on some input parameters.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Weak reference usage: The weakref.ref() function is not used correctly to create a weak reference to the 'self' object.
2. Incorrect usage of the weak reference: The weak reference is not used in a way that avoids creating a reference cycle.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being created correctly, and even if it were created correctly, it is not being used properly to avoid a reference cycle.

To fix the bug:
1. Use the weakref.proxy() function to create a weak reference to the 'self' object.
2. Pass the weak reference proxy to the _engine_type() function to avoid creating a reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weak reference proxy instead of weakref.ref
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
