The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be the use of `weakref.ref()` method. The purpose of using `weakref.ref()` is to prevent circular references, but in this case, it is returning a weak reference object instead of the actual reference to the `self` object.

The correct approach should be to use `weakref.proxy()` method instead of `weakref.ref()` to obtain a proxy reference to the `self` object, which will allow accessing the original object attributes and methods as needed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
