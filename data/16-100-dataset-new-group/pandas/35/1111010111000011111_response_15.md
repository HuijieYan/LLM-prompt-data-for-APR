To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex) is maintained properly and not dropped prematurely.

The cause of the bug is that when creating the weak reference to `self`, it is not properly retained, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this, we need to update the `_engine` function to correctly maintain the weak reference to `self` throughout its lifetime.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Maintain the weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

This correction ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the function's execution, preventing it from being dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
