The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is failing to return the expected output, as indicated by the failing test case and the provided error message. The error message indicates that the `NoneType` object does not have the attribute 'view', which suggests that the weak reference `period` is being dropped prematurely.

The cause of the bug is related to weak referencing in the `_engine` function. It seems that the weak reference `period` is being cleared too early, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains valid for the duration it is needed.

The corrected version of the `_engine` function is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    def get_engine_type(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    return get_engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By creating an inner function `get_engine_type` that takes the weak reference `period` and the length as parameters, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until the engine type is returned.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the failing test case passes.
