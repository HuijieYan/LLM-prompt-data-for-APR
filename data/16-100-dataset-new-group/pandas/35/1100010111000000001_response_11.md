## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator, which means it should only be calculated once and then cached for subsequent calls. It takes a weak reference of `self` and then returns the result of `self._engine_type` called with the weak reference and the length of `self`. 

## Potential error locations:
1. The weak reference of `self` might not be used correctly.
2. The `self._engine_type` might not handle the weak reference properly.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug may be causing the weak reference not to be utilized correctly or the `self._engine_type` is not handling the weak reference properly. This could result in incorrect behavior when calling `_engine` multiple times.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the documentation of `self._engine_type` to ensure it handles weak references correctly.
2. Verify that the weak reference of `self` is being used correctly within the `cache_readonly` decorator.

## Corrected version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type()(period, len(self))  # assuming _engine_type is a constructor
```
In the corrected version, `self._engine_type` is called as a constructor, and the weak reference `period` is passed as an argument. This ensures that the weak reference is handled correctly and that the `cache_readonly` behavior is maintained.
