The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference of `self`. The weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the function execution.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected implementation of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

By using `self._data` instead of `self`, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained for the `PeriodIndex` `_engine_type` method to receive the intended `PeriodIndex` instead of `None`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
