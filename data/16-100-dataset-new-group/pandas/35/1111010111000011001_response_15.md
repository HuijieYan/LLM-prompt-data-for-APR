### Bug Explanation
The bug is causing the test case to fail because the `_engine` function is expected to return an instance of `self._engine_type` but it is returning a weak reference instead.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to be modified to return an instance of `self._engine_type` instead of a weak reference.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
