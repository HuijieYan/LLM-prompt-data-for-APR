The buggy function `_engine` appears to be a cached property that returns the engine type for the period index. It uses a weak reference of `self` to avoid a reference cycle.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the call to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` or in the caching mechanism itself.

The cause of the bug could be related to the caching mechanism failing to invalidate and update the cached value properly.

To fix the bug, we can try to manually invalidate the cache or use a different caching mechanism. Instead of using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, we can switch to a conventional property with caching using an instance variable to store the cached value. This way, we have more control over the caching mechanism and can manually invalidate the cache when needed.

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine_cache'):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._engine_cache = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_cache
```

In this corrected version, the function uses a conventional property with caching using an instance variable called `_engine_cache` to store the cached value. When the function is called, it checks if the cache is already populated. If not, it populates the cache with the engine type and returns the cached value. This way, the caching mechanism is under our control, and we can ensure that the cache is updated or invalidated as needed.

By using this corrected version, we maintain the caching behavior while preventing the potential issues with the previous caching mechanism. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
