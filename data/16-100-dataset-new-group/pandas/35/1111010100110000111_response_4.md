The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the error. This function is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it appears that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in an AttributeError when attempting to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, the weak reference mechanism needs to be revised so that the `PeriodEngine` does not receive a `None` when accessing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
By modifying `period` to `period()`, we are invoking the weak reference to retrieve the `PeriodIndex` object, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely.

With this modification, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
