### Cause of the bug
The `_engine` function seems to be trying to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, but due to the way the weak reference is being created, it is not behaving as expected. This is likely causing issues when the `_engine_type` function is called with the weak reference as an argument.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is created correctly in the `_engine` function so that it does not create a reference cycle and works as expected when passed to the `_engine_type` function.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
