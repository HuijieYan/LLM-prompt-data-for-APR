Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the weak reference of the PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. To fix this bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex should be maintained properly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Maintain a weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(weak_period_ref, len(self))
```

By maintaining a weak reference to `self`, the bug related to the weak reference being dropped prematurely should be fixed, and the failing test should now pass as expected.
