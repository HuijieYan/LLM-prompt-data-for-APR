## Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

## Analysis
The buggy function is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator which suggests that the function is trying to cache the result of `_engine` function. However, the implementation of the function itself seems correct, and the bug might be related to how the `_engine_type` is handling the weak reference object.

## Potential Error
The potential error could be in the `_engine_type` function where it is not handling the weak reference object properly, leading to a reference cycle or memory leak.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the weak reference not being handled properly, leading to a reference cycle and potential memory leak.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the `_engine_type` function handles the weak reference object correctly and does not cause a reference cycle. This may involve modifying the implementation of `_engine_type` to properly handle weak references.

## Corrected Version
The corrected version of the function is the same as the original function, as it seems to be implemented correctly. The bug fix needs to be applied to the `_engine_type` function or any other code that interacts with the weak reference object.
