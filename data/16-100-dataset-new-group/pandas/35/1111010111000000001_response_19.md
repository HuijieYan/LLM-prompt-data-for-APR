The buggy function `_engine` is defined within the `PeriodIndex` class. It is a `cache_readonly` method that returns an instance of `_engine_type` (which is assumed to be a class) using a weak reference to `self` as an argument.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect usage of the weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` which may result in the weak reference being immediately collected, leading to a `None` return value.
2. The assumption that `_engine_type` is a class, but it is not defined in the provided code snippet.

The cause of the bug is related to the usage of weak references. The weak reference `period` created using `weakref.ref(self)` may not be used correctly, causing the weak reference to be immediately collected due to lack of proper handling. Additionally, the class `_engine_type` is assumed to exist, but it is not defined in the given code.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could be to properly use the weak reference and ensure that it is held in a way that prevents it from being immediately collected. Also, defining the `_engine_type` class or using an existing class to initialize the `_engine` instance would be necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
class _engine_type:
    def __init__(self, period, length):
        self.period = period
        self.length = length

    # other methods of _engine_type

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return _engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we assumed the existence of a `_engine_type` class and defined its structure with an `__init__` method that takes `period` and `length`. The `_engine` function uses `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, ensuring that the weak reference is held in a way that prevents it from being immediately collected.
