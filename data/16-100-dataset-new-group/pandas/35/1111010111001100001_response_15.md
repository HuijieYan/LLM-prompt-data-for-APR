The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return an instance of `self._engine_type` which takes two arguments - a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`. However, the implementation seems to be incorrect as it is not using `self._engine_type`, and it is not passing the correct arguments to the `_engine_type` constructor.

The bug causes the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail when creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to correctly use `self._engine_type` and pass the correct arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```
In this corrected version, `self._engine_type` is being used and the correct arguments are being passed to it. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
