## Fixing the bug

The issue seems to be related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function. It appears that the weak reference to `self` is being passed incorrectly to `_engine_type`, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to `_engine_type` so that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are now calling `period()` to retrieve the referenced object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.
