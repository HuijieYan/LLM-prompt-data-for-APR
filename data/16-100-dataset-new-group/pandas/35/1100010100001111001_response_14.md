The buggy function is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object using the `weakref.ref` method and then passing it to the `_engine_type` method. However, the issue is that `weakref.ref` returns a weak reference object, not the original object, so passing it to `_engine_type` will not work as intended.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to directly pass the `self` object to the `_engine_type` method without using `weakref.ref`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing the `self` object to the `_engine_type` method, we ensure that the method receives the original object as intended. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
