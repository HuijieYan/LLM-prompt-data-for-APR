The buggy function is the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. Its purpose is to initialize and return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and the length of the index.

The potential error location is the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` when called inside the failing test. This causes an `AttributeError` because the `PeriodEngine` tries to access an attribute from a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the use of the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference to maintain the reference to self throughout the use of the PeriodEngine
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
In this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is assigned to `period_ref` and passed to the `PeriodEngine` constructor, maintaining the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

With this fix, the failing test should pass, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
