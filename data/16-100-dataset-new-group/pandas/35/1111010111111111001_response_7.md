The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning a weak reference to the `self` object. However, this weak reference is not being used properly, leading to an `AttributeError` during the failing test.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference and return the expected value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    return engine_type(period, len(self)) if engine_type else None
```

By using the `engine_type` properly and adding appropriate error handling, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is used correctly, thereby fixing the bug.

With this correction, the failing test case should pass without raising an `AttributeError`.
