### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using the `cache_readonly` decorator, but it's failing to return the expected output when used in the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. This indicates that the cache read-only attribute is not working correctly, causing the function to return an unexpected result.

### Bug
The bug is in the `_engine` function using the `cache_readonly` decorator. The function is supposed to return `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but due to the incorrect caching, the expected values are not being returned.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the caching mechanism needs to be reviewed to ensure that the function correctly returns the expected values when called. This may involve adjusting the caching mechanism or potentially using an alternative approach to ensure the correct values are returned.

### Fixed function
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
