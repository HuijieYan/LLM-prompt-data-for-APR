The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing the `NoneType` object error in the failing test. The `PeriodIndex` class has an attribute `_engine_type` that is used to create the engine for the index. In the `_engine` function, a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is being passed to the `_engine_type`.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the fact that the `PeriodIndex` object is not being properly passed as a weak reference to the `_engine_type`, resulting in the `NoneType` object error when using the engine in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to correctly pass a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object to the `_engine_type` when creating the engine.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass without the `NoneType` object error.
