## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function is a cache_readonly decorator for the _engine method in the period.py file. The issue reported on GitHub relates to copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, which results in losing weakrefs. The problem is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The issue could potentially be caused by the weakref.ref() not properly creating a weak reference to self, or by the _engine_type method not handling the weak reference correctly.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the GitHub Issue information

The buggy function uses weakref.ref() to create a weak reference to self, but the issue reported on GitHub indicates that this weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex, causing the error when attempting to check if the levels are monotonic.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is properly maintained throughout the execution of the _engine method. This may involve revisiting the way weakref.ref() is used and ensuring that the reference to PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version of the function, the import statement for weakref.ref() is updated, and the use of weakref.ref() is modified to create a weak reference to self. This should ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the execution of the _engine method, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
