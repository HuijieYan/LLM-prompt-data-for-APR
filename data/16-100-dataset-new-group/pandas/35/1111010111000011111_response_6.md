To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly so that the `_engine_type` function does not receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The bug in the current implementation is that the weak reference is not being used correctly, leading to the `_engine_type` function receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to correctly use the weak reference to `self` and pass it to the `_engine_type` function. This ensures that the `_engine_type` function receives the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly, ensuring that the `_engine_type` function receives the expected `PeriodIndex` reference.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
