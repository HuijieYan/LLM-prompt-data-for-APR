The buggy function `_engine` returns the result of calling `_engine_type` with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments, but it seems that `period` is being weakly referenced. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised when trying to access the 'view' attribute of a 'NoneType' object, which means that the weak reference might be causing the issue.

The GitHub issue suggests that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` does not get dropped prematurely, and that it is properly passed to `_engine_type` so that it does not become a `None` object.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a strong reference to self to avoid it being dropped prematurely
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using a strong reference to `self` instead of a weak reference, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not prematurely dropped before being passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
