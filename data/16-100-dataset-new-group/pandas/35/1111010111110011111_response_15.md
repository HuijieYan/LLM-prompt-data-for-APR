To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine. The issue appears to be related to the weakrefs being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

### Steps to Resolve the Bug
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is preserved until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.
2. Investigate any potential issues with the management of weak references within the _engine_type or PeriodEngine.
3. Modify the _engine function to handle the weak reference correctly and eliminate the premature dropping of the reference.

### Corrected Version of the _engine Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Ensure the weak reference is still valid before returning the engine
    if period() is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex has been dropped prematurely")
```
In the corrected version, we create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex and use it to initialize the PeriodEngine. After initializing the engine, we check if the weak reference is still valid. If it is, we return the initialized engine. If the weak reference has been dropped prematurely, we raise a ValueError.

This corrected version should address the premature dropping of weak references and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the appropriate reference to the PeriodIndex.

By implementing this correction, the failing test case should return the expected output (True), as described in the GitHub issue.
