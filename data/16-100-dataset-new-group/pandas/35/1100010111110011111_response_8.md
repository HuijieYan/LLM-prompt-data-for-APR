The buggy function `_engine` has a potential error location with the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line, where `period` is being initialized as a weak reference to `self`. The bug causes the `is_monotonic` attribute of the `PeriodEngine` to return an error due to the `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

The bug is caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `period` is maintained until after it is used for creating the `PeriodEngine'. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable so that it can be utilized when creating the engine without being prematurely deleted.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self in a variable and then pass it to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values.
