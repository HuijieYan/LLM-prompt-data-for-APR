The buggy function `_engine` is causing an error related to an `AttributeError` that is resulting from `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` in the function's return statement. The expected outcome is that this part of the code should return a view of type "i8" without any errors.

The bug appears to be due to the fact that `self._engine_type` is not able to operate as expected. This could be caused by the weak reference of `self` not being used correctly, leading to a `NoneType` error.

To fix the bug, the weak reference of `self` should be called using the `period` object to retrieve the actual object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Define the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Retrieve the actual object using the weak reference
    self_ref = period()
    return self_ref._engine_type(self_ref, len(self))
```
