The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError when the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is run. The bug is in the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` which seems to be returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function needs to be modified to correctly instantiate and return the `PeriodEngine` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).get_engine()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `PeriodEngine` object is returned from the `_engine` function, resolving the AttributeError and enabling the failing test to pass.
