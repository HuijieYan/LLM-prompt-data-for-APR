To fix the bug in the given function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained properly so that it is not dropped prematurely.

The bug is causing the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error, which is due to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _engine function to maintain the weak reference properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained properly, preventing it from being dropped prematurely, and resolving the AttributeError issue.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
