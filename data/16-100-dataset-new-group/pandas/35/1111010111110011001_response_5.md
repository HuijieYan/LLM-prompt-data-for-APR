Based on the error message and the failing test, it seems that the `_engine` function is not returning a valid engine type, causing the subsequent calls to `is_monotonic` to fail. The error message specifically mentions that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which indicates that the engine returned by `_engine` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine type, and it should not return `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    # Validate the engine type and return it
    if engine is None:  # Handle None type case
        raise ValueError("Engine type should not be None")
    return engine
```

By adding a validation check after creating the engine, we ensure that the engine is not `None` and that it can be used correctly in subsequent operations. This change should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
