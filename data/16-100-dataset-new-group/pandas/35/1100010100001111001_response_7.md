The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to use weakref to create a weak reference to the 'self' object, but it is not being used correctly.

The correct usage of weakref to create a weak reference to self should be `period = weakref.ref(self)()` instead of just `period = weakref.ref(self)`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
