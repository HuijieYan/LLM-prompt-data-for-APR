## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

### Analysis:
The buggy function is using a cached readonly decorator, and it is intended to return the _engine_type using a weak reference of self. However, the bug lies in the weakref.ref() call, which is used to create a weak reference to the 'self' object. This weak reference is stored in the 'period' variable but not used properly when calling 'self._engine_type'.

### Error:
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference 'period' is not used when calling 'self._engine_type'.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, the weak reference 'period' needs to be passed as an argument when calling 'self._engine_type'. This ensures that a weak reference to 'self' is being used.

The corrected version of the function would be:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
