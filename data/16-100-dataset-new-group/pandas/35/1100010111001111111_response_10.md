The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be caused by the weak referencing of the `self` parameter and then passing it to the `_engine_type` function. This leads to the `_engine_type` function receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we can directly pass the `self` parameter to the `_engine_type` function without creating a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
This corrected version of the `_engine` function should resolve the weak reference issue and ensure that the `_engine_type` function receives the `PeriodIndex` as intended, thereby passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values.
