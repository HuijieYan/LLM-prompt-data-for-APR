The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then use it to initialize the `_engine_type`. However, the use of `weakref.ref(self)` is unnecessary and causes a weak reference to the `self` object, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should simply remove the `weakref.ref(self)` and directly pass `self` to initialize the `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
