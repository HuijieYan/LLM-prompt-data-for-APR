The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is not correctly returning the `_engine_type` with the correct arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to pass the weak reference of the `self` object to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self._values)
```

With this fix, the failing test should pass.
