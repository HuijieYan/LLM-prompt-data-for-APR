The issue seems to be related to the weak reference being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

Looking at the buggy function `_engine`, the weak reference is being created with `weakref.ref(self)`, but the reference may be getting dropped before it's intended to be used in the `PeriodEngine`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def _engine_type_wrapper(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    
    return _engine_type_wrapper(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we create a wrapper function `_engine_type_wrapper` that captures the weak reference to `self` and calls `self._engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of the `PeriodIndex`. This ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained for the duration of the `_engine` function's execution, resolving the issue with the weak reference being dropped prematurely.

With this correction, the failing tests should pass, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
