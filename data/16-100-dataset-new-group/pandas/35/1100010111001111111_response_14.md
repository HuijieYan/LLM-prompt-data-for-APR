Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference handling. The weakly referenced `period` variable may be dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained for the duration of its usage in the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference `period_ref`, we ensure that the intended `PeriodIndex` is used in the `PeriodEngine`.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it should resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding weak referencing and the `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
