To fix the bug in the _engine function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the function's execution so that it does not get dropped prematurely. 

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to the self object (PeriodIndex) is not being stored in a way that ensures it will persist throughout the execution of the _engine function. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a reference to None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we can modify the _engine function to properly store the weak reference to the self object, ensuring that it persists throughout the function's execution.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store a weak reference to self
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        
        # Define a function that captures the weak reference and uses it in the PeriodEngine creation
        def create_period_engine(ref, length):
            return self._engine_type(ref, length)

        # Call the function with the weak reference and length(self)
        return create_period_engine(period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we store the weak reference to self in the variable period_ref, and then use it within a nested function create_period_engine to create the PeriodEngine. By doing this, we ensure that the weak reference persists throughout the function's execution, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub problem description.
