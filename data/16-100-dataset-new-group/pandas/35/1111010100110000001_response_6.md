The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the AttributeError in the test case. The error message indicates that an attribute `view` is being accessed on a `NoneType` object, which points to `self._engine` returning `None` instead of the expected type.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method returns the expected `PeriodEngine` type instead of `None` as currently happening in the buggy function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._engine_type
```
