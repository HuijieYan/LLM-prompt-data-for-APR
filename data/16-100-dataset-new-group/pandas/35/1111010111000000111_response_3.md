The bug in the `PeriodIndex` class is related to the `_engine` function not properly passing a weak reference to the `PeriodEngine` constructor, which causes it to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to errors in the `MultiIndex` functionality.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass a weak reference to the `PeriodEngine` constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By passing `weakref.ref(self)` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex`, preventing reference cycles and resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

After making this modification, the `_engine` function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
