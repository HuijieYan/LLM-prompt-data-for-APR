```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self.dtype)
```

In this corrected version, I added an additional argument `self.dtype` to the `_engine_type` function call, assuming that it is necessary based on the context and the purpose of the function `_engine`. This should resolve the issue by ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` is weakly referenced and not dropped prematurely.
