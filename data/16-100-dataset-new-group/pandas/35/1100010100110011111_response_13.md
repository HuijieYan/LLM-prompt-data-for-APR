The buggy function is the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. It uses `weakref.ref` to avoid a reference cycle and then returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The failing test is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` losing weakrefs, and it raises an AttributeError when checking for monotonicity.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to check for monotonicity.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the process, and the `PeriodEngine` should not receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if result is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create PeriodEngine")
    return result
```
