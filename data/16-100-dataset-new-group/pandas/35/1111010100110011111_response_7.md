The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

The cause of the bug is related to the weak referencing of the `self` object in the `_engine` function. Due to weak referencing, the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of the `self` object is properly maintained and that the `PeriodIndex` is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Use the weak reference to obtain the PeriodIndex object
    period_index = period()
    # Check if the weak reference is still valid
    if period_index is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period_index, len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is no longer valid")
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is properly obtained and used to initialize the `PeriodEngine`. It also includes a check to ensure that the weak reference is still valid before creating the `PeriodEngine`.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
