## Bug Explanation
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, which is causing the test to fail. The purpose of `weakref.ref` is to create a weak reference to the object `self`, but it is being assigned to the variable `period` and not being used correctly in the `_engine_type` function.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary usage of the `weakref.ref` and directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` function.

## The corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Directly pass self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
