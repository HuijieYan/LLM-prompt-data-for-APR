The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the test to fail due to the following error:
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'
```
This error occurs because the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected object, causing subsequent operations to fail. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" describes this problem and expects the test to return `True` instead of raising an error.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should return the appropriate `PeriodEngine` object instead of `None` as it does currently. The weak reference to `self` seems to be incorrect, as it is passed as `period` to `_engine_type`. We should refactor the weak reference usage and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` object is created and returned correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Ensure that self is correctly passed to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
In this corrected version, we remove the weak reference usage and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` to create the `PeriodEngine` object.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test, returning the expected output of `True`.
