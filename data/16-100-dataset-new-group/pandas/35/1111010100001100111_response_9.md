## Analysis
The `_engine` function is intended to return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class using a weak reference to the current `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the weak reference is likely not being passed correctly, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

The bug is likely causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely, leading to the `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is constructed and passed correctly to the `PeriodEngine`. This may involve adjusting how the weak reference is created and used within the `_engine` function.

## Bug Fix
```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc
import weakref

@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    ...
    """
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use a weak reference to the current PeriodIndex instance
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        # Pass the weak reference and length to the PeriodEngine
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this fixed version, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly created using `weakref.ref(self)` and then passed to the `PeriodEngine` as intended. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
