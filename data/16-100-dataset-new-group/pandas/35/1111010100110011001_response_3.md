The buggy function `_engine` is using a `weakref` to create a reference to the `self` object. However, it is not using the `period` to create the `PeriodEngine` instance. This is causing an `AttributeError` when `view("i8")` is called on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug:
- Modify the `_engine` function to pass the `weakref` object `period` to the `PeriodEngine` constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By passing the `weakref` object `period` to the `PeriodEngine` constructor, the bug should be fixed and the function should return the expected values without raising an `AttributeError`.
