The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, but it currently returns a weak reference to `self` that is intended to avoid a reference cycle.

### Error
The error occurs when the function `is_monotonic_increasing` tries to access the attribute `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, which raises an AttributeError due to `self._engine` being a weak reference that is not properly resolved.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be dereferenced before being used to create an instance of `_engine_type`.

### The corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
