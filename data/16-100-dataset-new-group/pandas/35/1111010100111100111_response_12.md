The bug in the `_engine` function of the PeriodIndex class is causing it to return a NoneType object instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to an AttributeError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the duration of its usage in the `_engine` function. We can achieve this by modifying the code to use a weak reference to the PeriodIndex and ensuring it is still valid when being accessed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    ref_to_self = weakref.ref(self)
    def engine_type(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    return engine_type(ref_to_self, len(self))
```
In this corrected version, we wrap the `_engine_type` function in a closure to ensure that the weak reference `ref_to_self` remains valid when it's called. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
