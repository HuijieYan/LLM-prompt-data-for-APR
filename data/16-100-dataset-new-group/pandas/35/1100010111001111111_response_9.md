Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, it seems that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The fix for this bug would be to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex remains valid until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex will remain valid until it is used by the PeriodEngine, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report and making the failing test pass.
