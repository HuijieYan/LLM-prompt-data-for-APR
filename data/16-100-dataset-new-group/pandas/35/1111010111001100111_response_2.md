Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex inside the _engine function. The weakref.ref() creates a weak reference to the self object, but it seems that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is likely the cause of the failing test and the issue raised on GitHub.

To fix this, we can modify the _engine function to ensure that the weak reference to the self object is maintained throughout its usage. We can use a lambda function to create the weak reference and then use it within the _engine_type call.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):

    # Use a lambda function to create a weak reference
    period_ref = lambda: weakref.ref(self)

    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By using the lambda function to create the weak reference to the self object and passing it to the _engine_type, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout its usage and should address the issue with weakrefs being dropped prematurely. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
