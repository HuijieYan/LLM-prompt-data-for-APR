The bug in the function lies in the use of weakref.ref(self) while trying to create a weak reference to the 'self' object. 

The weakref.ref() function returns a weak reference object pointing to 'self', but it is not being used correctly within the _engine() function. Instead of passing the weak reference object to self._engine_type, the original 'self' object should be passed.

To fix the bug, we should update the _engine() function to correctly use the weak reference object before passing it to self._engine_type.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
