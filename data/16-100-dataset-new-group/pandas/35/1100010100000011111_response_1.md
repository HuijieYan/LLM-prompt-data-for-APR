## Analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_engine` is meant to create a weak reference to the `self` instance and pass it to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. However, it seems that the weak reference is not being created correctly, leading to unexpected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

The issue describes a situation where copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weakrefs, causing an error. The expected output is for the `is_monotonic` property to return True, but it's currently raising an error due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations within the `_engine` function are the creation of the weak reference using `weakref.ref` and the passing of the weak reference to `_engine_type`.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the GitHub Issue

The bug seems to be caused by the weak reference not being created correctly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This results in unexpected behavior and errors when accessing properties of the index.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is being created correctly and passed to `_engine_type`. This may involve modifying the way the weak reference is created and handled within the `_engine` function.

## Providing a corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version of the function, we use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` as intended. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the weak reference is handled correctly.
