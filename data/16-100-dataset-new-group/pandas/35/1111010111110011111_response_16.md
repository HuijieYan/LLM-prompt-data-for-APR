The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' when trying to access the 'view' attribute of None.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is retained until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type and store it in a variable
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is stored in the `self_weakref` variable and passed to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is retained until it is used by `_engine_type`, preventing it from becoming None prematurely.

Once this fix is implemented, the failing test should pass, and the `is_monotonic` attribute check should return True as expected. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue about losing weakrefs in the MultiIndex.
