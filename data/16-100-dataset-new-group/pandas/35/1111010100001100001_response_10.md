The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The purpose of `weakref.ref` is to create a weak reference to the object `self`, but it's being assigned to a variable `period` which is not being used anywhere. This will not prevent the reference cycle as intended.

To fix this bug, we should create a weak reference to `self` directly and pass it to `_engine_type` without using the `period` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
