The bug occurs because the `_engine` function is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but `period` is assigned the value of `weakref.ref(self)`, which results in an error when `self._engine_type` is called. This is because `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference to `self` rather than the actual object.

To fix this bug, we need to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference using the `weakref.proxy` function before passing it to `self._engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
