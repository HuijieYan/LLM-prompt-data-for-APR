The bug lies in the _engine function. It seems to be returning an incorrect result due to the weakref.ref(self) being passed to the _engine_type function. The weakref.ref function creates a weak reference to the object, and when it is used as an argument to the _engine_type function, it might not be providing the correct reference to self.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be used properly to ensure that it is returning the correct reference to self.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weakref.proxy function is used to create a proxy to self, which provides a weak reference to the object that can be used safely in the _engine_type function. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
