The buggy function `_engine` takes `self` as a parameter. The expected type and value of `self` is not provided.

### Analysis
The function `_engine` seems to be trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to `self`.

### Bug
The bug in the function is that it's creating a weak reference to `self` and then immediately calling a method on it with len(self).

### Bug explanation
The bug is likely causing incorrect behavior due to the use of the weak reference. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors since the reference to `self` might become invalid.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be replaced with a direct reference to `self`. This will ensure that the reference to `self` remains valid.

### Corrected code
```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
