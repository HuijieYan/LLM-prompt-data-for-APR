The buggy function is the _engine method in the pandas/core/indexes/period.py file. The function is intended to create a weak reference to the input parameter "self" and then return the result of the _engine_type method called with this weak reference and the length of "self". The failing test test_get_level_values_when_periods in pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py expects that the output of the function is a PeriodIndex with monotonic levels, however, the current implementation of _engine does not correctly create a weak reference leading to an error.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to "self" is not being properly created, leading to the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the _engine function should be modified to correctly create a weak reference to "self" and then pass it to the _engine_type method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref, we create a correct weak reference to "self" and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the intended PeriodIndex.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue reported in GitHub by ensuring that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped before intended.
