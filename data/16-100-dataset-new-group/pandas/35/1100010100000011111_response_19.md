```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it is not passing the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, leading to the PeriodEngine getting a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex. This causes the issue described in the GitHub problem.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we pass the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.

The corrected version of the function ensures that a weak reference of `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue.
