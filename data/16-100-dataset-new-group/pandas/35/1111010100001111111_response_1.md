The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the weak reference to `self` being stored in a local variable `period`, which then needs to be used to pass to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly to create the weak reference.

To fix this bug, the correct strategy would be to replace `period = weakref.ref(self)` with `period = weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference proxy to `self`, which can then be passed to `_engine_type`.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
