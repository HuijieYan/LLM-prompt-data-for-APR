## Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` parameter and then using it to initialize a new object of type `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference process seems to be causing the issue as reported in the GitHub issue. The error is raised when the `_engine` function is called in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, which indicates that the weak reference might be getting lost unexpectedly.

## Bug Cause
The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before it is intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The weak reference to `self` should be handled more carefully to ensure that it remains valid for the lifetime of the `_engine` object. One potential fix is to use a strong reference to `self` within the `_engine` function instead of a weak reference.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
In this corrected version, the weak reference has been removed, and a direct reference to `self` is used to initialize the `_engine_type` object. This will ensure that the reference to `self` remains valid for the lifetime of the `_engine` object.
