The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function is that it is using the `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The `weakref.ref` function should be used to create weak references to objects, but it is not being dereferenced properly when passed to `_engine_type`. As a result, the engine is not being constructed with the correct reference to the `self` object.

To fix the bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference created with `weakref.ref` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done using the `.dereference()` method of the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period.dereference(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference `period` is properly dereferenced before being passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the engine is constructed with the correct reference to the `self` object.

This fix should address the issue and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes as expected.
