The bug in the `_engine` function is likely caused by the weak reference to `self` being used incorrectly. This can result in the `self` object being collected by the garbage collector before the `_engine_type` is called, leading to a `NoneType` error.

To fix the bug, we should modify how the weak reference to `self` is created and used within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference is no longer necessary as it was causing the issue. This should ensure that the `self` object remains in scope throughout the `_engine_type` call, resolving the `NoneType` error that was occurring.

By making this change, we can expect the `_engine` function to correctly return the `_engine_type` object with the given `self` object and its length, as expected by the failing test.
