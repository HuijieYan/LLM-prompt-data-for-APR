### Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function, it appears that the issue is related to weak reference handling. The `_engine` function is supposed to return a weakly referenced value, but currently, it is causing a NoneType error. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, which mentions that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to handle weak references correctly and ensure that they are not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

In this corrected version, we are explicitly checking whether the weakly referenced PeriodIndex `period()` is not None before creating the PeriodEngine. This prevents the NoneType error that was occurring due to weak reference handling.

By making this correction, the failing test should now pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
