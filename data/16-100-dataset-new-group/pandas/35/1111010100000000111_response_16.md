## Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before it's intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Error Location:
The error seems to be in the `_engine` function where a weak reference to the PeriodIndex is created but not properly maintained.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

## Bug Fixing Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained as long as it's needed by the PeriodEngine.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
