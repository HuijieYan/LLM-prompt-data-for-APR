The bug in the provided function seems to be related to weak references and the PeriodEngine receiving a None object instead of the intended PeriodIndex. The failing test "test_get_level_values_when_periods" is triggered by the problem, referring to an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' which prevents the expected output. 

It seems that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex. This is likely caused by the weakref.ref usage within the _engine function, which is expected to return the engine type and length of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine, and that it is not prematurely released. This would involve modifying the implementation of the _engine function to properly handle the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

In this corrected version, I have modified the function to properly store the result of self._engine_type in a variable (engine_type) and return this variable. This should ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is properly maintained until the engine type is created.

This change should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
