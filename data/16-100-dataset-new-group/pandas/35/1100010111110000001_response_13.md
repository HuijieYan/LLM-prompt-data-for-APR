The buggy function is `_engine` and it seems to be used within the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test, which is failing with the error message:
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'
```
A potential error location within the `_engine` function is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which is returning a type and the `weakref` object that could potentially be causing the 'NoneType' object error.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the `_engine_type` function not correctly handling the `weakref` reference passed to it, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned, which later leads to the `AttributeError`.

To fix the bug, we will need to modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference properly, ensuring that it does not result in a `NoneType` object being returned.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._engine_type.__new__(self._engine_type)
```
In the corrected version, we ensure that the weak reference is properly handled and that `NoneType` errors are avoided.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass without any `AttributeError` related to the `_engine` function.

Note: Depending on the specifics of the `_engine_type` function behavior, additional adjustments might be necessary.
