The buggy function `_engine` has a potential error in the way it creates a weak reference to `self` and passes it to `_engine_type` to create the engine object. The issue may be caused by the weak reference not being maintained throughout the execution of the function, leading to a `None` being passed instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` to the `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution and that it is properly passed to `_engine_type` without being lost.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained by assigning it to the variable `period`. Then, when passing it to `_engine_type`, it will maintain the weak reference relationship and prevent a `None` being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output as described in the GitHub issue.
