The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is an instance of the `PeriodIndex` class. However, it seems like the weak reference is not being properly handled, and as a result, the `_engine_type` method is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type.

It's likely that the weak reference is not being properly stored, causing it to be garbage collected when it shouldn't be.

To fix this, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly store the weak reference to `self` and ensure that it's not being prematurely garbage collected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly store a weak reference to self to avoid premature garbage collection
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we create a new attribute `_period_weakref` on the `self` object to store the weak reference. This ensures that the weak reference is not prematurely garbage collected as long as the `self` object is still in use.
