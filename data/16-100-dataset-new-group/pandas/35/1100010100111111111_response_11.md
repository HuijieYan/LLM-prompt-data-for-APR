The issue with the provided function is that it's returning `None` instead of the expected engine type, resulting in an 'AttributeError' when trying to access the 'view' attribute in the failing test.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the engine type is correctly returned and not replaced with `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct engine type and resolve the 'NoneType' attribute error in the failing test.
