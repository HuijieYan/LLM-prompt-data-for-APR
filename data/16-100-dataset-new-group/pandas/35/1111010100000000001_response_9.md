The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is using the `cache_readonly` decorator which suggests that it is intended to cache the result and return it without recomputation on subsequent calls.

The potential error location within the buggy function is with the `weakref.ref(self)` usage. The `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference to the object which may lead to the reference being deleted before it is accessed, causing unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, and this can lead to issues when trying to access the weak reference later on.

To fix the bug, the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` should be replaced with a regular reference to the object. Additionally, it may be useful to ensure that the cached result is only computed once and then returned on subsequent calls.

Here's the corrected version of the `PeriodIndex` class with the fixed `_engine` function:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    (class documentation here)
    """

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
            self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(self, len(self))
        return self._cached_engine
```

In this corrected version, we removed the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` and instead created a cached attribute `_cached_engine` to store the result of the `_engine_type` computation. This ensures that the result is only computed once and then returned on subsequent calls.
