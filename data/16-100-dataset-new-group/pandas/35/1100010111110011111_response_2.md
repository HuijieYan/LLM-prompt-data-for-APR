To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) is maintained until after it is used in the `_engine_type` method. One common strategy for achieving this is to store the weak reference to `self` in a local variable before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will prevent the weak reference from being garbage collected prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self in a local variable before passing it to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return result
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in the `period` variable and then using `period` in the `self._engine_type` method, we ensure that the weak reference is not lost prematurely.

Additionally, this correction should resolve the issue reported in GitHub, as it ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped before intended, preventing the `NoneType` attribute error when being used in the `_engine_type` method.
