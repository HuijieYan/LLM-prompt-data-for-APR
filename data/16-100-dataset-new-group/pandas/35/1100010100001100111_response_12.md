Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to weak referencing the PeriodIndex, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex, resulting in the error raised in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Store a strong reference to the result to avoid immediate deallocation
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return result
```
