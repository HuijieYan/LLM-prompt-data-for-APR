The bug in the `_engine` function is that it should be returning the weak reference `period` instead of calling the `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`. This is causing the test to fail because it expects the period index to be of the correct type and monotonic, but the actual behavior is incorrect due to the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to return the weak reference `period` instead of calling `_engine_type` with `period` and `len(self)`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, return a weakref of self.
    return weakref.ref(self)
```

With this correction, the function will return the weak reference of `self`, satisfying the expected values and types of the function's parameters during the failing test execution. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
