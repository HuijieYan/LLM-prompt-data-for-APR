The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function is that it is not properly handling the weak reference to the `self` object, leading to potential reference cycles.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference to the `self` object by using the `weakref.proxy` method before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period_proxy = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_proxy, len(self))
```

With this fix, the `_engine` function should now handle the weak reference to the `self` object properly, avoiding potential reference cycles.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass without any issues.
