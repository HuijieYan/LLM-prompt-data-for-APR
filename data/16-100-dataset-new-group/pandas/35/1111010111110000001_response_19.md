### Analysis:
The failing test is trying to check if all the levels of the indexed period are monotonic, but the error message indicates that the value returned by `PeriodEngine` is a NoneType and this is causing an AttributeError when it tries to access the 'view' attribute. 

### Error Locations:
The issue seems to be in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class, where the `PeriodEngine` instance is created and returned.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by a weak reference (`weakref.ref(self)`) being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor when creating the `_engine` instance, which results in the `PeriodEngine` instance being None.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Passing a weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor does not seem to be correct and is causing the issue. We need to ensure that a valid `PeriodEngine` instance is created and returned by the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
In the corrected version, we pass `self` as the first argument to `_engine_type`, ensuring that a valid non-None `PeriodEngine` instance is created and returned. This should address the issue encountered in the failing test.
