#### Potential issues:
The use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference may be causing the `_engine_type` function to receive a reference that has already been deleted, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned.

#### Bug cause:
The `_engine` function returns a weakref to `self`, which may not be functioning correctly, leading to the `NoneType` object error.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
Instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`, we can directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` function, as it should handle reference cycles appropriately.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
