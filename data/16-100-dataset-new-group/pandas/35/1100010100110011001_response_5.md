self: PeriodIndex

#### Expected return value
An instance of the _engine_type with the parameters (weakref.ref(self), len(self))

### Expected case 2
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
self, len(self)

#### Expected return value
An instance of the _engine_type with the parameters (weakref.ref(self), len(self))


## Bug Explanation
The buggy function is using the @cache_readonly decorator. However, it seems that there is a problem with the weakref and how it's being used within the function. The error message suggests that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', indicating that the weakref is returning a NoneType instead of the expected reference to the object, causing an AttributeError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakref is correctly referencing the object and not returning a NoneType.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correct the weakref usage to avoid the AttributeError
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:  # Check if weakref is valid
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self is None.")
```
