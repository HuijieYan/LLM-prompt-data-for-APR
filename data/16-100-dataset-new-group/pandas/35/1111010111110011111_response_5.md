The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError when attempting to access a view attribute of a NoneType object. This is due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, allowing the `PeriodEngine` to receive the correct object. This could potentially involve changes in the caching and weak reference implementation in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

This correction ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is properly passed to the `_engine_type` and returned as the engine object, preventing the premature dropping of the weak reference.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the expected output in the failing test case should return True, as indicated in the GitHub issue description.

This correction addresses the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".
