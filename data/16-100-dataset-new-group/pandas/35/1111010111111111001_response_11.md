The bug seems to be in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class. It returns a value using the _engine_type, but there seems to be an issue with the weakref passed in.

The weakref.ref() method returns a weak reference to the object passed into it. When this weak reference is accessed, it returns the original object or None if the object has been garbage collected.

The AttributeError in the failing test indicates that the _do_monotonic_check() function is trying to access the view attribute of the returned value and is failing because the returned value is None.

To fix this bug, we should directly pass the self object to the _engine_type instead of using weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing the self object directly, we ensure that the _engine_type receives a reference to the PeriodIndex instance, avoiding the weak reference issue and preventing the AttributeError.
