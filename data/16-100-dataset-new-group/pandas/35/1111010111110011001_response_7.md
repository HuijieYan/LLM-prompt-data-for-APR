The buggy function `_engine` is using the `cache_readonly` decorator which could be causing the issue in the failing test since it attempts to return `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. 
To fix this, we can try to change `cache_readonly` to `property`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@property
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
