#### The cause of the bug
The bug in the function `_engine` is likely due to the incorrect use of `weakref.ref`. The intention of using `weakref.ref` is to avoid creating a reference cycle, but it seems to be used incorrectly.

The function is expected to return an instance of `_engine_type`, constructed with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`. However, the current implementation does not achieve this goal due to the incorrect use of `weakref.ref`.

#### Suggestions for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref` should be used correctly to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. This will avoid creating a reference cycle and ensure the intended behavior of the function.

### Corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    ... (same as before)
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
