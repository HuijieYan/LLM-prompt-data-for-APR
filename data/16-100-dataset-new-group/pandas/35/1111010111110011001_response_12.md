The given buggy function, `_engine()`, is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle. It returns the result of calling `self._engine_type()` with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`. 

The failing test, `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, creates a `PeriodIndex` and attempts to access its level values, but encounters an `AttributeError` because the result of the call to `_engine()` is `None`, resulting in the error message indicating that a `'NoneType'` object has no attribute `'view'`.

It seems that the weak reference to `self` is not being handled properly within the `_engine()` function, resulting in the unexpected return value of `None`, which leads to the AttributeError later on.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to `self` should be handled correctly within the `_engine()` function to ensure that the result of calling `self._engine_type()` is returned as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine()` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if result is not None:
        return result
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Failed to create engine.")
```

By handling the result of the weak reference and ensuring that it is not `None`, we can prevent the AttributeError during the failing test execution.
