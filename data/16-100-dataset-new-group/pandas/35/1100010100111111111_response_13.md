I suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex. The weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before its intended purpose, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. To fix this, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until the intended purpose is fulfilled.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# This is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    weakref.finalize(self, engine, period)
    return engine
```
