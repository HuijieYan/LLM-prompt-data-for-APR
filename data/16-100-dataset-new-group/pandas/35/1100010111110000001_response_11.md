The given buggy function is a property function `_engine` that uses the `@cache_readonly` decorator to cache its value once the property is called for the first time. The function returns the result of calling the `_engine_type` attribute of `self` with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments. The error message suggests an 'AttributeError' related to the 'NoneType' object not having the 'view' attribute.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `self._engine_type` is returning a `None` value or an incorrect object.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine_type` attribute of the `self` object is returning a `None` value instead of a valid object. This results in an AttributeError when the returned object is being accessed.

To fix the bug, the `_engine_type` attribute of the `self` object should be inspected to ensure that it returns a valid object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type_result is not None:
        return engine_type_result
    # handle the case if _engine_type returns None
    else:
        # perform some error handling or raise an exception
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
```

In the corrected version, after calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, it is checked whether the returned object is `None`. If it is `None`, the corrected function can handle the case appropriately, for example, by raising a ValueError. This ensures that the `_engine` function does not return a `None` value that may lead to an AttributeError.
