The bug appears to be with the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The `weakref` reference is not being used properly, which may be causing the failing test.

The expected behavior of the `PeriodIndex` class and its `_engine` function is to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and use it to initialize the engine. However, based on the runtime input values and types, it seems that this weak reference is not being properly utilized, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should properly utilize the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object to create and return the engine.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By properly utilizing the weak reference with `period()`, we can ensure that the engine is correctly initialized with the `PeriodIndex` object and avoid the reference cycle issue that may be causing the failing test.
