The issue seems to be related to the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout the function call.

Based on the GitHub issue, the fix should involve ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is kept alive while creating the `Period` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use a lambda function to create a closure around the weak reference to `self`. This ensures that the weak reference remains alive when creating the `Period` object, resolving the issue of the weak reference being dropped prematurely.

This should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
