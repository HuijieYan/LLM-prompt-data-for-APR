The buggy function has a few issues:

1. The `@cache_readonly` decorator may not be used correctly, which could lead to caching issues.
2. The `weakref.ref()` method call seems to be missing an argument, as it should take an object to reference.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect use of the `@cache_readonly` decorator and the missing argument in the `weakref.ref()` method call, which prevents the function from returning the correct output.

To fix the bug, we should remove the `@cache_readonly` decorator and ensure that the correct object is passed to the `weakref.ref()` method call.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By removing the `@cache_readonly` decorator and fixing the `weakref.ref()` method call, we ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.
