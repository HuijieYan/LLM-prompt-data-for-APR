The bug is located in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class. The bug causes weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the _engine function should be updated to properly handle weak references to the PeriodIndex and avoid dropping the weakly referenced PeriodIndex prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the _engine function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self.dtype)
```
In the corrected version, the weakref.ref(self) is used to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance, and the weak reference is then passed to the _engine_type with the additional argument self.dtype to ensure that the PeriodEngine does not receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.
