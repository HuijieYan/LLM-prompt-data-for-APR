The buggy function `_engine` is causing an error because it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is created using `weakref.ref(self)`. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

The expected behavior of the function is that it should return the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without causing any AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` should be properly handled to ensure that it does not result in a 'NoneType' object when used in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)  # Use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled, and the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
