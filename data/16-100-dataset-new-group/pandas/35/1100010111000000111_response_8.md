The potential error in the buggy function is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it should be, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weakref.ref() needs to be maintained until the PeriodEngine is done using it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    period()  # Keeping the weakref alive until the engine is done using it
    return result
```

With this correction, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex will be maintained until the PeriodEngine is done using it, ensuring that the engine receives the correct PeriodIndex.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and the failing test.
