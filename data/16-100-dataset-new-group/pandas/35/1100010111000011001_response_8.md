The buggy function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which caches the return value of the function and returns the cached value on subsequent calls. This means that the `_engine` function will only be called once and then its return value will be cached.

The bug in the function is that it is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` on the first call and then returning the cached result on all subsequent calls. This may not be the intended behavior for the function.

To fix the bug, the `@cache_readonly` decorator needs to be removed so that the function is called every time it is accessed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
Removing the `@cache_readonly` decorator will ensure that the `_engine` function is called on every access, fixing the bug and allowing the function to return the expected result.

By using the corrected version of the function, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass as expected.
