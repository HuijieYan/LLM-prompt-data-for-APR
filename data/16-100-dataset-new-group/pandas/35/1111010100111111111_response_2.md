The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the error in the failing test. The function returns an instance of `self._engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` to it. However, the weak reference handling seems to be incorrect, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the 'view' attribute on a 'None' object.

To fix this bug, the weak reference handling needs to be revised to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is not dropped before intended when passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

Given the analysis, here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying `period` to `period()`, we are now creating an actual weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. This change should prevent the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` from being dropped prematurely, resolving the issue reported in the failing test.
