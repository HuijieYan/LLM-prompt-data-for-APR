The bug is likely to be in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. This function is creating a weak reference to `self` and then using it to create an instance of `self._engine_type`. However, the weak reference is not used in a way that prevents cycles, and the weak reference is not used at all in the rest of the function.

The `self._engine_type` is not defined in the provided code snippet, but assuming it's a class or a factory function, it's being called with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments. However, `self` is a weak reference, not the actual object it refers to, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

The bug is likely to cause the `_engine` function to return an instance of `self._engine_type` that has been initialized with a weak reference to `self`, which could lead to unexpected behavior and is likely the cause of the failing test.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be used appropriately, considering that the purpose is to avoid a reference cycle. The weak reference should be dereferenced to get the actual object before being used to create an instance of `self._engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to get the actual object
    actual_self = self
    period = weakref.ref(actual_self)
    return actual_self._engine_type(period, len(actual_self))
```
