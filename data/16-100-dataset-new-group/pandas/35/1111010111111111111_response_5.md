To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained properly so that it is not dropped prematurely. 

We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function to use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a proxy reference to the `self` object. This will ensure that the weak reference is active as long as the object proxy is alive and in scope, preventing it from being prematurely dropped.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak proxy reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy`, we ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained as long as the proxy reference is in scope, preventing the issue of the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

With this fix, the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should now pass as expected, and the GitHub issue related to the bug should be resolved.
