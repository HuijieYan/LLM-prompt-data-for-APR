The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return an instance of `self._engine_type`, a PeriodEngine, for the PeriodIndex class. However, it is currently using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference, but it is not being used properly to avoid the reference cycle.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` is not being properly utilized, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in incorrect behavior when using weakly referenced PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex.


To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly use the weak reference and avoid the reference cycle.


Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use a weak reference properly to avoid a reference cycle
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.proxy(self)` is used to create a weak reference to `self`, which avoids the reference cycle and ensures that the PeriodEngine receives the proper PeriodIndex.

By making this change, the bug should be fixed and the function should produce the expected behavior, allowing the failing test case to pass. This will address the GitHub issue related to dropping weakly referenced PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex.
