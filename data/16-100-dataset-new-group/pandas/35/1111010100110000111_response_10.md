The potential bug location is within the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a `PeriodIndex`, causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute. This suggests that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is not behaving as expected.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be modified to ensure that it maintains a reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self and pass it to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing a strong reference to the `PeriodEngine` instead of a weak reference, it ensures that the engine receives the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

This fix should resolve the error and ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained as intended.
