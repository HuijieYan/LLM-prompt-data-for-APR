#### Expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
The function is expected to return an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`.

### Analysis
The buggy function seems to be attempting to create an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference is not being passed correctly to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Bug
The bug is in the `weakref.ref()` function call, which does not correctly pass `self` as a weak reference to `_engine_type`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should directly pass the weak reference to `_engine_type` without the need for the `weakref.ref()` function call.

### Corrected code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
