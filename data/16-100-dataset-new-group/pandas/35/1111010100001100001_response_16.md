The bug in the function `_engine` is that it is not correctly creating the engine type using weak references. The function is supposed to create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the length of the period index.

The bug is likely causing issues when accessing the engine later on, leading to incorrect behavior and results.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

By passing `len(self._values)` instead of `len(self)`, we ensure that the correct length of the period index is used when creating the engine.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the engine is correctly created using weak references.
