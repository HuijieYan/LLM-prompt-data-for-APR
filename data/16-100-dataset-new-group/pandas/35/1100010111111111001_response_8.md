The issue in the buggy function is that the `period` variable is not used when creating the `_engine` instance, which leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the weak reference `period` when creating the `_engine` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).finalize()
```

By adding `.finalize()` at the end, we ensure that the weak reference is used when creating the `_engine` instance.

This should fix the `AttributeError` and make the failing test pass.
