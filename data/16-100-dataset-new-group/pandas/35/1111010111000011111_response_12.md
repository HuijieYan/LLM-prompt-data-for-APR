There is a bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being correctly utilized and is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` value instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_engine` function to properly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to the `PeriodEngine`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By creating a weak reference to `self` as `period_weakref` and passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the intended `PeriodIndex` instead of a `None` value.

This fix should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes as expected.
