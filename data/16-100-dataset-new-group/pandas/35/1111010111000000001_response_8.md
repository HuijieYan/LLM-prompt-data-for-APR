The potential error in the buggy function `_engine` is that it is trying to create a weakref of the `self` object, but it is not explicitly referencing the weakref internally.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the use of weakref.ref(self) without storing the result within the `_engine` method. When the method is called again, the weak reference may have been collected already, resulting in an error.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be stored within the `_engine` method to ensure that it does not get collected prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference `self._period` is stored within the `_engine` function to ensure its availability during subsequent method calls.
