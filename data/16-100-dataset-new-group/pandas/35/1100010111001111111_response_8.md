The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly using weak references. This causes the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the test failure.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is being used correctly in the _engine function to prevent the PeriodIndex from being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference to prevent premature dropping of the PeriodIndex
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self._data)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))

```

With this correction, the _engine function should now properly use weak references to prevent the PeriodIndex from being dropped prematurely, resolving the issue and causing the failing test to pass.
