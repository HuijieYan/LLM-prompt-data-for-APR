## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using a weakref to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of the `PeriodIndex` class. The weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the `PeriodIndex` is used within a `MultiIndex` and the levels are copied, the weak reference is lost and the `PeriodEngine` receives a `None` instead of the original `PeriodIndex`.

## Error location
The potential error location is when creating the weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped when it is copied within the `MultiIndex`, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the original `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained when the `PeriodIndex` is copied within the `MultiIndex`.

## Corrected code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Wrap the call to _engine_type in a lambda that captures the weak reference
    # This ensures that the weak reference is maintained when self is copied within a MultiIndex
    return lambda: self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
