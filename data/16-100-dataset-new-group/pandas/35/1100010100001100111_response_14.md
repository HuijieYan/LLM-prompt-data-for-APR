Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The weakref is not being properly created for the PeriodIndex object.
2. There might be an issue with how the weak reference is being used within the _engine_type function.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the weak reference not being utilized correctly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in the unexpected behavior observed in the GitHub issue.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Properly create the weak reference for the PeriodIndex object in the _engine function.
2. Verify if the _engine_type function is properly handling the weak reference.

Given the buggy function, a corrected version could be:

```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference of self to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

The corrected version focuses on properly creating the weak reference for the PeriodIndex object and passing it to the _engine_type function to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.
