The bug is related to weakrefs being dropped before they should be, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None object instead of the PeriodIndex. This causes an AttributeError when the test function checks for monotonicity.

To fix this bug, we can revise the `_engine` function to ensure that the weakref to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout its usage.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weakref to maintain a reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is maintained throughout its usage within the `_engine` function, resolving the bug that was causing the AttributeError and the failing test.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
