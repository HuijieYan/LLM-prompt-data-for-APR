#### Potential Bug Locations
The bug is likely in the `_engine` function, specifically in the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line.

#### Bug Explanation
The bug is likely caused by the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line, where the `period` and `len(self)` parameters might not be correctly used to create the engine. This leads to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

#### Suggested Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the use of `period` and `len(self)` parameters in creating the engine should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the engine is correctly initialized.

#### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
