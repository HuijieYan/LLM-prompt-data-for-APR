The issue is related to the fact that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The bug is in the `_engine` function, where it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The weak reference `period` is holding the reference to the original object, but it's not being used to create the `_engine_type` object. This results in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `NoneType` object instead.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to use the weak reference `period` when creating the `_engine_type` object, ensuring that the original `PeriodIndex` object is not prematurely dropped.

The corrected version of the `_engine` function is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` when creating the `_engine_type` object, we are retrieving the original `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference, ensuring that it is not prematurely dropped. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.

After making these changes, the corrected version of the `_engine` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
