The bug in the given function `_engine` is likely causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error when running the failing test.

The `weakref.ref()` function is used to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it seems that it might be returning `None` instead of the expected weak reference to the `self` object. This results in the subsequent call to `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` failing with an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is created correctly and does not return `None`. We can achieve this by using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Using `weakref.proxy` ensures that a weak reference to the `self` object is correctly created, fixing the bug.

After making this change, the failing test should pass without raising an AttributeError.
