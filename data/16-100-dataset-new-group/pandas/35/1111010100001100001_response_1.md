The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is not correctly passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. This can cause a reference cycle and potential memory leaks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In this corrected version, we are passing `self._values` instead of `self` to `_engine_type`, and we are using the length of `self._values` instead of `self` to avoid a potential reference cycle.
