The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is an instance of the `PeriodIndex` class. However, due to the implementation of weak references, the object may be garbage collected prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the function should store a strong reference to `self` and then create a weak reference to it. This will ensure that the object is not garbage collected until it is no longer in use.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _engine(self):
        # Store a strong reference to self
        period = self
        # Create a weak reference to self
        period_ref = weakref.ref(period)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(period))
```

By storing a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object will not be garbage collected prematurely, resolving the issue described in the GitHub problem.
