### Analysis
The issue seems to be related to weak references being lost, specifically with the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This is causing an AttributeError when the `is_monotonic_increasing` method is called. The `_engine` attribute in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be the cause of the weak reference being lost.

### Potential Error Locations
The bug could be related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the weak reference `period` not being properly handled or maintained. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError when the `is_monotonic_increasing` method is called.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be properly maintained and handled within the `_engine` function. It may involve ensuring that the weak reference does not get lost prematurely.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Maintain the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The corrected version ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained and not lost prematurely. This should address the issue of the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object.
