The buggy function `_engine` is using the decorator `@cache_readonly` to compute and store a value, but is not returning the correct value. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the attribute 'view' on a NoneType object in the failing test.

To fix this, the function needs to correctly compute and return the expected value when accessed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).vgetter().view("i8")
```

By adding `.vgetter().view("i8")` at the end of the return statement, we are ensuring that the correct value is being returned, which should fix the AttributeError issue in the failing test.
