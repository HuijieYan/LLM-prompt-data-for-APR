The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is related to the use of `weakref.ref(self)` which is intended to prevent memory leaks by avoiding reference cycles. However, the implementation is incorrect and does not achieve the desired result.

The bug causes the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail because the `weakref` is not correctly capturing a weak reference to `self`, leading to potential memory leaks and incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`. This will return a weak proxy to the `self` object, which can be used within the `_engine_type` without creating a strong reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the corrected `_engine` function should resolve the memory management issue and pass the failing test.
