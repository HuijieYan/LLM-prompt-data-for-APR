The buggy function is the `_engine` function in the `period.py` file of the pandas library. The function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` (which is an instance of PeriodIndex) and then using it to create an instance of `_engine_type`. However, there is a bug where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, one strategy is to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained for the entire duration of the `_engine_type` instance creation. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a local variable and then using it to create the `PeriodEngine` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference is immediately invoked with `()` after being created, ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the creation of the `PeriodEngine` instance. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
