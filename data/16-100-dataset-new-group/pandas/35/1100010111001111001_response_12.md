The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref`, but it is not dereferencing the weak reference when passing it to `_engine_type`. This means that `_engine_type` is receiving a weak reference object instead of the actual `self`. 

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the patched file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
