The buggy function `_engine` in the class `PeriodIndex` is causing the failing test to raise an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This error originates from the `is_monotonic` method within the `pandas/core/indexes/base.py` file, which in turn calls `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` and eventually raises the AttributeError.

The cause of the bug is that the `weakref` is not being properly implemented in the `_engine` function, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This bug has been reported as a GitHub issue under the title "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `weakref` is correctly implemented in the `_engine` function, allowing the `PeriodEngine` to correctly receive the reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```
