## Corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, use a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), dtype=self.dtype)
```

## Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to create a weak reference to self and pass it to the _engine_type function. However, it is missing the dtype parameter in the return statement, which is required for proper function invocation.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the missing dtype parameter in the return statement, which leads to an incorrect function invocation.

## Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by adding the dtype parameter in the return statement to ensure proper function invocation.

## Corrected Version
The corrected version of the function includes the dtype parameter in the return statement for proper function invocation.
