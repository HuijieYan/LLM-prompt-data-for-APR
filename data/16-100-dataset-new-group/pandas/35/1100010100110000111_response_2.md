## Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` when using the `is_monotonic` property. The error specifically states that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', suggesting that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` gets dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the `_engine` function, where a weak reference to self (the `PeriodIndex`) is being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, which results in the `NoneType` object error when trying to access the `view` method.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the use of the `_engine_type` and not dropped prematurely.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine_type.ref = period  # Store the weak reference in engine_type
    return engine_type
```

In the corrected version, we store the weak reference in `engine_type` so that it is not dropped prematurely, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the valid weak reference to the `PeriodIndex`. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
