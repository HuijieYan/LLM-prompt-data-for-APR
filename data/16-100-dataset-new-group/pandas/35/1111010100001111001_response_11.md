The bug in the function `_engine` is that it is not correctly creating a weak reference to the `self` object.

The bug occurs in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` where it creates a weak reference to `self` but does not correctly use it in the `_engine_type` call.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to use the weak reference `period` correctly when calling `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
