The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError due to a weak reference being dropped prematurely.

The cause of the bug is that when the `_engine` function returns, the weakly referenced `self` drops before it should, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until the `_engine` is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
