The possible cause of the bug is that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being lost, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained so that it is not lost before being used by the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By creating a separate weak reference variable `period_ref` and passing it to the `_engine_type` method, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout the function's execution.

This fix should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post and allow the test case to return True as expected.
