The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` function is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator to cache its result. The purpose of the function is to create an instance of `_engine_type` using `weakref` to avoid a reference cycle.

The potential error location in the `_engine` function is the use of `weakref.ref(self)` without handling the weak reference properly to avoid a potential reference cycle.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference created with `period = weakref.ref(self)` does not prevent the `self` object from being deleted while still holding a reference to it, which can lead to a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be used in a way that does not prevent the `self` object from being deleted. One way to achieve this is by using the weak reference directly at the point where it's needed, without storing it as a variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weak reference directly without storing it in a variable
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference is created using `weakref.proxy(self)` directly within the call to `_engine_type`, ensuring that it does not prevent the `self` object from being deleted.

This change addresses the potential reference cycle issue and provides a strategy for fixing the bug.
