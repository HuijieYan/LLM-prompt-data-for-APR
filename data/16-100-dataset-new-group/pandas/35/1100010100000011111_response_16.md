1. Analysis:
The _engine function is supposed to return the engine type using a weak reference to the self object. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

2. Error Locations:
The potential error in the given function is the weakref.ref(self) method, which might not be preserving the weak reference as intended.

3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to the self object is not being preserved as intended. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to errors in the test case described on GitHub.

4. Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the self object is preserved correctly and not dropped prematurely.

5. Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)

    # Check if the weak reference still exists before using it
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self has been dropped prematurely")
```
In the corrected version, we first create a weak reference to the self object. Then, before using the weak reference, we check if it still exists. If it does, we pass it to the _engine_type function; otherwise, we raise a ValueError indicating that the weak reference has been dropped prematurely. This ensures that the weak reference is preserved until it is no longer needed.
