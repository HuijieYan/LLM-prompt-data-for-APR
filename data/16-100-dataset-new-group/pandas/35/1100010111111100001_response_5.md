The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to a weak reference not being used correctly. When calling `self._engine_type`, the weak reference `period` is not being properly dereferenced, resulting in a `NoneType` object being accessed.

To fix this bug, the weak reference object should be dereferenced using the `()` notation to access the original object. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By adding the `()` after `period`, the weak reference is properly dereferenced, and the original object is accessed.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
