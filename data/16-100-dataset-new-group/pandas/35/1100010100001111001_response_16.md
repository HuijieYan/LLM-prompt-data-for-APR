The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the use of `weakref.ref` and passing it as an argument to `self._engine_type`.

The `weakref.ref` function creates a weak reference to the object passed to it, allowing the object to be garbage collected if there are no other references to it. However, in this case, it seems that the intention is to use the weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but the implementation is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the usage of `weakref.ref` and correctly pass the weak reference to the `_engine_type` function.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we create a weak reference proxy to `self` that can be used in place of `self` without creating a strong reference. This should resolve the reference cycle issue and fix the bug.
