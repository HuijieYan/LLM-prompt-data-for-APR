To fix the buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is intended to be dropped. A potential error in the current implementation is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not being handled properly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To address this issue and fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference to `self` until it's intended to be dropped. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference to `self` in a variable within the function and using it to create the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version:
```python
def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        weakref_self = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(weakref_self, len(self))
```
By storing the weak reference to `self` in the `weakref_self` variable, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it's intended to be dropped, thus resolving the issue of the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None`.

With this corrected version, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should now pass, resolving the GitHub issue related to losing weakrefs in the `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
