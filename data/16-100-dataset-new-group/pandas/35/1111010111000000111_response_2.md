### Analysis
The `PeriodIndex` class contains the buggy `_engine` method, which is being called in the failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` from the `test_get_level_values.py` file. The GitHub issue describes that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Location
The error is likely within the `_engine` method, where the weak reference is not being handled correctly, leading to it being dropped prematurely.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is the premature dropping of a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` should be maintained properly within the `_engine` method to ensure it is not dropped prematurely.

### Corrected Version
```python
from pandas.typing import Axis, Level, Dtype
from pandas.core.arrays._period import PeriodEngine
from pandas.core.arrays._mixins import DatetimeDelegateMixin

# ... (other imports and class definition)

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeDelegateMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other class code)

    # corrected _engine method
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return PeriodEngine(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
In the corrected version, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is created using `weakref.proxy` to ensure it is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue and fix the bug.
