## Analysis
The _engine function is expected to return the _engine_type using a weak reference of self. However, the use of weakref.ref(self) is causing a problem, leading to the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Bug Location
The bug is in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
This line creates a weak reference to self, but it is not being used properly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to self is not being utilized properly, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is causing the function to return an incorrect value.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly utilize the weak reference to self and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy(self)` to pass a weak reference of self to the _engine_type. This ensures that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex and resolves the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
