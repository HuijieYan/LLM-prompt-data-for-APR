The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is caused by the incorrect use of `weakref.ref(self)` when instantiating the `_engine_type`. The `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being properly used when instantiating the `_engine_type`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential reference cycle issues.

To fix the bug, we should change the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.proxy(self)` in the `_engine` function. Using `weakref.proxy(self)` will create a weak proxy to the `self` object, which can be used safely in the instantiation of the `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By making this change, the function should no longer create reference cycle issues and will correctly pass the failing test.

The corrected version of the `_engine` function addresses the bug and ensures that weak referencing is used properly.
