The buggy function `_engine` is trying to return a value using `self._engine_type` with the weak reference of `self`. However, it appears that the weak reference `period` is not being handled correctly, leading to an AttributeError when attempting to access the view attribute.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being properly converted back to a strong reference when calling `self._engine_type` which is leading to a 'NoneType' object error.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference properly and convert it back to a strong reference before using it to call `self._engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version of the function, the weak reference `period` is called as a function `period()` to convert it back to a strong reference before being passed to `self._engine_type`. This should resolve the AttributeError issue that was occurring.
