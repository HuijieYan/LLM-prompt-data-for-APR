The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the AttributeError in the failing test case. The bug is likely related to the `_engine_type` method, which is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected result.

The bug seems to occur because the `weakref.ref(self)` is not being correctly passed to the `_engine_type` method, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By adding `()` after `weakref.ref(self)`, we are actually calling the weak reference, and passing the result to the `_engine_type` method. This should fix the bug and ensure that the engine type is correctly initialized with a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
