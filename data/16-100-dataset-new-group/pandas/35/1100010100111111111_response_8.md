The issue appears to be related to weak references being lost, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in an AttributeError when the function attempts to access the view attribute.

The buggy function is using weakref.ref to create a weak reference to self, but it appears that the weak reference is not being preserved correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to use a weak reference to the object's method instead of the object itself. This should ensure that the weak reference is not lost prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of the _get_engine method to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self._get_engine), len(self))
```

By using weakref.ref(self._get_engine) instead of weakref.ref(self), we create a weak reference to the _get_engine method of the object, ensuring that it is not lost prematurely.

This corrected version of the function should address the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
