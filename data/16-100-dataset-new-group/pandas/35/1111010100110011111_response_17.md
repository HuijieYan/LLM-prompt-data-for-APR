The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object, leading to an error in the failing test. The expected output is for the failing test to return True, indicating that the function is working correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it should be, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self until the engine is created
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we maintain a reference to `self` until the `_engine` is created, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` object instead of a `NoneType` object. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
