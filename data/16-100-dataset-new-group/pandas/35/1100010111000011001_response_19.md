### Analysis
The `_engine` function is a cache readonly function that returns the engine type for the given period. The cause of the bug is likely due to the `weakref.ref(self)` implementation, which might not be correctly referencing `self`.

#### Potential Error Location
The issue might be with the `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `_engine` function returns the engine type for the given period. The `weakref.ref(self)` might not be referencing `self` correctly, causing the failure of the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The fix strategy will involve ensuring that `weakref.ref(self)` correctly references `self` and the engine type is returned properly.

### Corrected Version

```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
