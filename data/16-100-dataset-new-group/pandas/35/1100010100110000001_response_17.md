First, the bug in the function `_engine` is causing the AttributeError in the failing test. When the failing test calls the method `is_monotonic_increasing`, it eventually accesses the `_engine` object which does not exist due to the bug in the `_engine` function.

The function `_engine` is using the `cache_readonly` decorator, but it does not define any arguments for it, resulting in the incorrect creation of the cached value. This error leads to a `NoneType` object being returned when the cached value is accessed later.

To fix the bug, we need to provide the correct arguments to the `cache_readonly` decorator. In this case, we need to remove the `@cache_readonly` decorator from the function and define the cached property in the class manually.

Here's the corrected version of the function and the corresponding class structure:

```python
# The corrected version of the function

@property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))


# The corrected class structure containing the cached property

class PeriodIndex:
    def __init__(self, periods, name=None):
        self.periods = periods
        self.name = name
        self._cache = {}

    @property
    def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

    @property
    def _engine_type(self):
        # define the _engine_type property here
```

By manually defining the cached property within the class, we ensure that it is created and accessed correctly, avoiding the `NoneType` object error. With these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
