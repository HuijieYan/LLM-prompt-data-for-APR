## Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

### Analysis:
The buggy function is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` using the `weakref.ref` function, but it is not properly dereferencing the weak reference object before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This can cause the weak reference to be passed instead of the actual object, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

### Error locations:
The potential error is in the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `period` should be dereferenced using `period()` to obtain the actual object it references.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by failing to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `self._engine_type`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object using `period()` before passing it to `self._engine_type`.

### Corrected version:
The corrected version of the function has been provided above, where `period` is dereferenced using `period()` before passing it to `self._engine_type`.
