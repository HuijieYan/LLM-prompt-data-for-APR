Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_engine` function is related to the weak reference handling. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it's intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until after it's used by the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return result
```

With this corrected version, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex`) is maintained until it's used by the `_engine_type`, resolving the issue reported in GitHub. This should now return the expected output without losing weakrefs.
