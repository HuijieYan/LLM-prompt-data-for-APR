### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method within the class `PeriodIndex` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`. The function appears to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and then return the result of calling the `_engine_type` method with the weak reference and the length of the index.

The error is related to weak referencing and the `PeriodEngine` class, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to call the `view("i8")` method on a `NoneType` object.

The expected input/output values are not explicitly provided, but it is mentioned that the expected output of the failing test should be `True`.

The GitHub issue "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" describes the problem as the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The weak reference creation may not be properly maintained, causing the reference to be lost prematurely.
2. The `_engine_type` method may not handle weak references correctly, leading to the creation of a `NoneType` object.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by a premature drop of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected weak reference.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained properly and that the `_engine_type` method handles weak references correctly to avoid the creation of a `NoneType` object.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    ...

    """

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
   def _engine(self):
        # Use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference that does not expire when the original object is gone.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the `_engine` function now uses `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference that does not expire when the original object is gone. This ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained properly, addressing the bug. The corrected function should satisfy the failing test and the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
