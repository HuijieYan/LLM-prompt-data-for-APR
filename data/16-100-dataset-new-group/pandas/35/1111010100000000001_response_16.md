Potential errors in the buggy function:
1. The _engine function is using the cache_readonly decorator, which might not be used correctly.
2. The weakref.ref(self) is being passed as an argument to the _engine_type function, which may not be the correct usage of weak references.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the _engine function may be related to incorrect usage of the cache_readonly decorator or passing weak references to _engine_type.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the correct usage of the cache_readonly decorator and ensure it is being used appropriately.
2. Verify the correct usage of weak references and whether it is necessary to pass a weak reference to _engine_type.

Here is the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we removed the use of weakref.ref(self) and passed self directly to the _engine_type function. This should resolve the potential issues with weak references and ensure the correct behavior of the _engine function.
