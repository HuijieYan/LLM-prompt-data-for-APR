The buggy function `_engine` is failing because it is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object. This is causing the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error when the function `is_monotonic_increasing` is called.

The cause of the bug is in the `_engine` function, where it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. Here, `period` is being created as a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being used correctly. As a result, the weak reference is not being maintained and the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be used to ensure that the reference cycle is broken correctly and the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weak reference to break reference cycle
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
In the corrected version, `weakref.proxy` is used to create a weak reference to `self`, ensuring that the reference cycle is broken as intended. This should resolve the issue as reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test.
