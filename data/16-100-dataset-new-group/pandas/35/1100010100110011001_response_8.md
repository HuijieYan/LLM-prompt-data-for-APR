The buggy function `_engine` is encountering an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object, which implies that the `_engine_type` method is returning `None` instead of a valid object.

The cause of this bug is that the `_engine_type` method is not returning a valid object, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` class's `vgetter` method returning `None` instead of a valid view of the index values. This is causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should include a check to ensure that the `_engine_type` method is returning a valid object before attempting to access its attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:  # Check if engine is a valid object
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type method returned None")
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check to ensure that the `_engine_type` method is returning a valid object, and raises a ValueError if it returns `None` to indicate that there is an issue with the `_engine_type` method.
