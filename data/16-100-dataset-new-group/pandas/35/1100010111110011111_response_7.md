## Explanation
The bug is likely caused by the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it's intended to. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError during the test.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the `_engine` function and is not dropped prematurely.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected function should maintain the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex`) and use it within the `_engine_type` function, resolving the issue of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.
