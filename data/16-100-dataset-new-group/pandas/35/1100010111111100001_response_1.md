The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError when the failing test is executed. This is likely due to a NoneType object being accessed for the 'view' attribute.

The bug in the `_engine` function appears to be related to the weak reference creation and usage. The weakref.ref(self) is assigned to period, but it should be dereferenced using period() to obtain the original object. This error is likely causing the NoneType object error, as the reference is not being correctly accessed.

To fix the bug, we should use the dereferenced weak reference object to get the original object before passing it to _engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using period() instead of just period, we are obtaining the original object from the weak reference, which should prevent the NoneType object AttributeError.

After making this change, the failing test should now pass.
