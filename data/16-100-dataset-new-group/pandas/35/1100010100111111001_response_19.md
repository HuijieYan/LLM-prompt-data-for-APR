The issue here is that the `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing that weak reference to `_engine_type`. However, `_engine_type` is expecting a non-weak reference to `self`.

To fix this bug, we should pass a non-weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. We can do this by using `self` directly, without creating a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
