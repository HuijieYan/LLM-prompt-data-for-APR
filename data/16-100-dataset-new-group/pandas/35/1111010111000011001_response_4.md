### Explanation
The buggy function is attempting to define a cached attribute `_engine` using the `@cache_readonly` decorator. However, it seems that it is intended to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and pass that reference to `_engine_type`. The issue may be arising from the way the weak reference is being created.

### Bug
The bug appears to be in the section of the function where it attempts to create a weak reference.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and pass that reference to `_engine_type`. 

### The Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
