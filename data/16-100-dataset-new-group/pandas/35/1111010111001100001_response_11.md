The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to create a weak reference to `self` and then returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This means that the `_engine_type` method is being called using the weak reference `period` and the length of `self` as arguments.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is being created incorrectly, and it may be leading to incorrect behavior when `self._engine_type` is called using this weak reference.

To fix the bug, we should create the weak reference to `self` correctly by using the `weakref.proxy` function, which creates a weak reference proxy to the `self` object. Then, this proxy should be passed to the `_engine_type` method along with the length of `self`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period_proxy = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_proxy, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is created correctly, avoiding reference cycles and potential memory leaks. This should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
