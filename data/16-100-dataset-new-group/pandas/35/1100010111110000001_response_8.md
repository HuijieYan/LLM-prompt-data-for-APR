The bug seems to be occurring in the `_engine` function in the pandas core index period file. The function is trying to reference a weak reference of `self` to pass to `_engine_type`, but the weak reference seems to be causing an issue with the subsequent calls. This is evident in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

The error message indicates that there is an attribute error on `NoneType` object, suggesting that the `vgetter()` call within the `_do_monotonic_check` function is returning `None`, causing issues in the subsequent calls.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of `self` is properly handled and doesn't lead to `None` object being passed to subsequent calls.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can ensure a proper reference is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue with the failing test.
