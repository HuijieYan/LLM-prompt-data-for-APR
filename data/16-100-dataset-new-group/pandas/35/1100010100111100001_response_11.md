The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the `_engine_type` method not returning a valid object, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The potential error location is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where the `_engine_type` method might not be returning a valid object.

The cause of the bug is likely that the `_engine_type` method is not properly creating an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class which is expected by the calling code.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid instance of the `PeriodEngine` class.

A corrected version of the function could look like this:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type if engine_type is not None else super()._engine
```

In this corrected version, we check if the returned `engine_type` is valid and return it if so, or fallback to the default behavior if it's None. This should handle the AttributeError that was occurring before.

This should address the issue and the failing test should pass with this corrected function.
