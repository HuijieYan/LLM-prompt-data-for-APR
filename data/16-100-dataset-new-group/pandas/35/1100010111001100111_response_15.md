## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

The bug in the original function is that it is passing a weak reference of self to `_engine_type` but not passing the actual self object which is causing the `_engine_type` to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The corrected version adds `self` as an additional argument when calling `_engine_type`.

This change ensures that the actual PeriodIndex object is passed to `_engine_type` along with the weak reference, resolving the issue of receiving None and allowing the function to work as expected.

With this fix, the failing test should pass and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
