Based on the provided information, it appears that the issue is related to weak references being dropped before they are intended within the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class.

It seems that the `_engine` function is using weak references in order to avoid a reference cycle, but it is not handling the weakly referenced `period` object properly, leading to a `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be updated to properly handle the weak reference and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    # corrected version of the `_engine` function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, a weak reference to the `self` object is obtained and used to create the `PeriodEngine` with the correct `PeriodIndex` object, addressing the issue with weak references being dropped prematurely.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
