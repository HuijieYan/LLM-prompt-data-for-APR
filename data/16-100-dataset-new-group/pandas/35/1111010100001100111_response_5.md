To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is being correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. The bug might be causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
