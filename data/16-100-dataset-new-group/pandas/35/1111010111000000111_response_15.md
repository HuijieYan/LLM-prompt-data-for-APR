### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, test code, the GitHub issue

The buggy function is `@cache_readonly def _engine(self)` within the `PeriodIndex` class. It is used to create an engine type and is referenced within the failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" describes the problem in detail and provides an example of how it fails.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error in the `@cache_readonly def _engine(self)` function is that it utilizes a weak reference to `self` while creating the engine type but does not handle weak reference properly, leading to a `None` being passed to the engine type instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` gets dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` when it is accessed. This results in an error, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be handled properly to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely. This may involve modifying how the weak reference is utilized or ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:  # Check if the weak reference is still valid
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex has been lost.")
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the weak reference `period()` is still valid before creating the engine type. If the weak reference is no longer valid, we raise a `RuntimeError` to indicate that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` has been lost.

This approach ensures that the weak reference is handled properly and that the `PeriodEngine` always receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.
