## Bug Fix
The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the weak reference not being properly passed to `_engine_type`. This results in the PeriodEngine getting a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to `_engine_type` to avoid the reference cycle issue.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
