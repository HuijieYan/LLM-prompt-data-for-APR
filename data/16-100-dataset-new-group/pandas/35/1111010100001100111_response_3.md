After analyzing the buggy function, the runtime input/output values, and the GitHub issue, it seems the bug is related to weak referencing and how the period index is being handled. The issue is causing weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The cause of the bug is the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to handle weak referencing correctly and ensure that the PeriodIndex is not prematurely dropped.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `period()` to obtain the referenced object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is correctly handled and the PeriodIndex is not prematurely dropped.

By making this change, we can resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that weak referencing is handled properly within the `PeriodIndex` class.
