The issue is caused by the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object due to an error in the weak reference handling. This causes the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute from the NoneType object in the subsequent code.

To fix this bug, the weak reference needs to be handled correctly and the `_engine` function should return the expected type of object.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
