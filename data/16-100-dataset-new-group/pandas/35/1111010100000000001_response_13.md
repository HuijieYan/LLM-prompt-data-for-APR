The buggy function is a cache_readonly decorator on the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. The purpose of this method is to return the engine type associated with the `PeriodIndex` object.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This can lead to a weak reference cycle.

The cause of the bug is that using weakref.ref to create a weak reference to self within the cache_readonly decorator can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly if the weak reference is used within the constructor of the _engine_type.

To fix the bug, it's recommended to directly create a weak reference to the `_engine_type` class, rather than using `weakref.ref` on `self`. This will avoid the potential for a weak reference cycle and ensure proper behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
