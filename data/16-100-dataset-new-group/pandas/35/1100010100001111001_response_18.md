The buggy function is using a `@cache_readonly` decorator to memoize the result of the `_engine` function, which means that the result is cached after the first call and returned on subsequent calls without re-evaluating the function. However, the issue arises from the fact that a weak reference to `self` is being passed to `_engine_type`, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that using a weak reference to `self` can lead to the reference being garbage collected before the function completes, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix the bug, we should not use a weak reference to `self` when calling `_engine_type`. Instead, we can directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of the function, fixing the bug.
