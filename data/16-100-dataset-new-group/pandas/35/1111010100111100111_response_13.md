## The potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is defined as a weak reference to `self`.
2. The error message indicates that `self._engine` is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

## The cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the weak reference `period` being dropped before intended. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. As a result, the `_do_monotonic_check` method in the `PeriodEngine` attempts to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains valid until the `_engine_type` method is invoked. This can be achieved by changing the weak reference strategy or ensuring that the reference is not prematurely dropped.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Store the weak reference in a variable to prevent it from being dropped prematurely
    engine_weakref = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    # Check if the weak reference is still valid
    if period() is not None:
        return engine_weakref
```

By storing the weak reference in the `engine_weakref` variable and then checking its validity before returning, we ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue and prevent the `NoneType` object error.
