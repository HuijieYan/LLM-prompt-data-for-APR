The buggy function `_engine` is intended to create an instance of the `_engine_type` using `self` and the length of `self`. The issue seems to be related to weak references and the dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly handle weak references and ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we replaced `weakref.ref` with `weakref.proxy` to maintain a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` without causing it to be dropped prematurely. This should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the intended `PeriodIndex`.
