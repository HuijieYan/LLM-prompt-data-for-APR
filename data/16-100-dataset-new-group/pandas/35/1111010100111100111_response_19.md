The bug in the function `_engine` is causing the error. The function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` as the `PeriodEngine` is getting a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the buggy function `_engine` should be modified to properly reference the `PeriodIndex` without dropping the reference. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can avoid dropping the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.

With this correction, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
