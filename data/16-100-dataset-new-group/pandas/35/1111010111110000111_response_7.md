To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, the weak reference `period` should be wrapped in a `self` call to keep a strong reference. This will prevent the weak reference from being garbage collected before it's intended to. The fixed `_engine` function should be as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
