Based on the runtime values and the expected values, it seems that the weakref of `self` is not being passed properly to `_engine_type`, causing it to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass the weakref of `self` to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In this corrected version, we are passing `len(self._values)` instead of just `len(self)` to `self._engine_type` to ensure that the correct length is passed. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
