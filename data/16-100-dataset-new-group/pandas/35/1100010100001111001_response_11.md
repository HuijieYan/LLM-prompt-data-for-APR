The issue with the provided buggy function is that it is trying to create a weak reference using the `weakref.ref` function on the `self` object, but this is not the correct way to create a weak reference to an object. 

To fix this bug, we should use the `weakref.proxy` function instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference proxy of self for _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that a correct weak reference to the `self` object is created, avoiding any reference cycles and potential memory leaks. This should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output values.
