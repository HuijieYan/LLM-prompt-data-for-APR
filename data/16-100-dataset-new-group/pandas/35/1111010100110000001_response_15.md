The buggy function is the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that the `_engine` method may be returning `None` when it should not, which then causes an error when attributes or methods are invoked on the `None` object.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the implementation of the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which is supposed to cache the result of the method and return the cached result on subsequent calls. However, there seems to be an issue with the caching mechanism, causing the `_engine` method to return `None` unexpectedly.

To fix the bug, I suggest manually implementing caching within the `_engine` method by using an instance attribute to store the cached value. This would ensure that the correct value is always returned, and caching behavior is guaranteed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._cached_engine
```

In this corrected version, we check if the cached engine instance attribute exists, and if not, we create it by invoking the `_engine_type` constructor with the necessary parameters. Subsequent calls to the `_engine` method will return the cached engine instance, ensuring that the correct value is returned. This implementation provides a reliable caching mechanism for the `_engine` method.
