The buggy function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator and returning a weakref of `self`. The issue is that when using a weakref, the referenced object can be garbage collected before it is accessed, causing unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is returning a weakref of `self`, which can lead to a reference cycle and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, remove the `weakref` usage and directly return the `_engine_type`. Use a regular cached property instead of `@cache_readonly` decorator.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@property
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
        self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(self, len(self))
    return self._cached_engine
```

With this corrected version, the `_engine` function should now pass the failing test.
