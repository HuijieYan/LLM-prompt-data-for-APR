To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of the PeriodIndex object is being properly passed to the _engine_type constructor in the _engine function.

The bug arises from the fact that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _engine function to properly pass the weak reference of the PeriodIndex object to the _engine_type constructor. We can accomplish this by modifying the function as follows:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, we ensure that the weak reference of the PeriodIndex object is maintained and passed to the _engine_type constructor, resolving the issue with losing weakrefs in MultiIndex levels.

This fix should address the problem described in the GitHub issue: "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs."
