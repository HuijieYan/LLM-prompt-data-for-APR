The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function which returns the `_engine_type` object created with `weakref` of `self`. The issue with the function is that it uses `weakref.ref` incorrectly, it should be using `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. 

The `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test is failing due to the incorrect handling of `self` in the `_engine` function. When the `_engine` function is called, it should return the `_engine_type` object based on a weak reference to `self`. However, due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`, the weak reference is not properly established leading to issues with the test.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be updated to use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` will be properly established, fixing the issue with the failing test.
