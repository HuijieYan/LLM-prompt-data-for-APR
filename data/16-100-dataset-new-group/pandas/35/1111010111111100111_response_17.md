The problem with the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`, but the weak reference isn't being used correctly. This causes an AttributeError when `PeriodEngine` is trying to access the weak reference.

To fix this problem, we should ensure that the weak reference is properly used to access the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By adding parentheses to `period` to call the weak reference object and returning the result of `self._engine_type(period(), len(self))`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly used to access the `PeriodIndex` object.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
