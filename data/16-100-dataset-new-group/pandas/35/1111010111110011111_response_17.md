To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the `period` is not garbage collected before its intended use in the `PeriodEngine`. The bug is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute of a NoneType object in the `PeriodEngine`.

To fix this, we should modify the `_engine` function to keep a strong reference to `self` and then use a weak reference to `self` when initializing the `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a strong reference to self to avoid garbage collection
    self_ref = self
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self_ref)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference will not allow the `PeriodIndex` object to be garbage collected before the `PeriodEngine` is initialized, resolving the issue.

The updated function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
