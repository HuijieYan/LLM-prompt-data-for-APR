The issue is related to the weak references being dropped before they are intended to be used, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we can modify the _engine function to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained for the duration of its use. We can do this by storing the weak reference outside of the function to prevent it from being prematurely dropped.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

_period_ref = weakref.ref(self)

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(_period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we store the weak reference to the PeriodIndex outside of the _engine function, ensuring that it is not prematurely dropped. Then, we use this stored weak reference within the _engine function to create the PeriodEngine, maintaining the reference for the duration of its use.
