## The cause of the bug
The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and use it to create a new instance of `self._engine_type`. However, because the weak reference is not being stored, it is immediately being garbage collected, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` instance. This behavior leads to the failing test because the weak reference to `self` is lost too quickly, causing an unexpected `None` to be passed to `_engine_type`.

## A strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is stored in a way that prevents it from being garbage collected prematurely. This will allow the correct `PeriodIndex` instance to be passed to `_engine_type`. Additionally, we should make sure that the weak reference is properly handled when creating the new `self._engine_type` instance.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
