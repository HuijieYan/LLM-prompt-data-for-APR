The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the use of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. This weak reference is then passed to `self._engine_type`, but it seems that the weak reference is not being used correctly, leading to the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to use the weak reference properly and ensure that it does not get dropped prematurely. We can do this by creating a strong reference to the weak reference object and then passing the strong reference to `self._engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Create a strong reference to the weak reference object
    strong_ref = weak_period()
    
    # Check if the strong reference is still alive
    if strong_ref is not None:
        return self._engine_type(strong_ref, len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case when the weak reference has been collected
        # This could be an error condition, and you may want to raise an exception here
        return None
```

With this modification, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is kept alive until it is explicitly checked in the function, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

This corrected function should pass the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
