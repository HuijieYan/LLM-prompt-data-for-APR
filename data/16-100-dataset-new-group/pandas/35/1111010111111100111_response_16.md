The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to raise an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This is because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we can update the `_engine` function to properly create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    def _create_weakref():
        return weakref.ref(self)

    period = _create_weakref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly created and returned from the `_engine` function, resolving the issue with weak references being dropped prematurely.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
