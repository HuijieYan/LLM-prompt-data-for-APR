The bug in the provided function is that it is using weakref.ref() incorrectly, which is causing the failing test. 

The function is intended to return a weak reference to self, but it is not being used properly. The weakref.ref() function creates a weak reference to the object, which means that it does not increase the object's reference count. This is useful for avoiding reference cycles, but in this case, it is not being used appropriately.

To fix the bug, we can simply remove the weakref.ref() and return a direct reference to self._engine_type. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This fix removes the unnecessary use of weakref.ref() and returns a direct reference to self._engine_type, which should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
