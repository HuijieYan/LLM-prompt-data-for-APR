The bug occurs in the `_engine` function in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`. The issue is related to a problem with weak references when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, which causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the `period = weakref.ref(self)` line. This line is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being used correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to properly create a weak reference to the `self` object and ensure that the weak reference is used correctly when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected function
def _engine(self):
    # Properly create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This will ensure that the weak reference is retained and used correctly when creating the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the issue with weak references being dropped prematurely.
