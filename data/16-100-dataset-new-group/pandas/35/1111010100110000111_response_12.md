The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is that it returns the result of calling `_engine_type` with a weak reference of `self` which results in a `NoneType` object. This leads to the error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access the view of the `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should return the result of calling `_engine_type` with `self` directly, without using a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
