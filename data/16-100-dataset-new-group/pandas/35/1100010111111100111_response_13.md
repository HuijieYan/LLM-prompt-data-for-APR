## Correction

The bug seems to be related to the weak reference creation in the `_engine` function. The weak reference to `self` is created, but it seems to be dropped prematurely, leading to a `NoneType` error.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until after it is used in the `_engine_type` call.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

With this fix, the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the `engine` is created, ensuring that the `NoneType` error will no longer occur. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and pass the failing test.
