## Analyzing the bug and error message

The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This is likely due to the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.

## Identifying potential error locations

The use of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function could potentially be causing the premature dropping of the weak reference.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the `NoneType` error when the `PeriodEngine` attempts to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

## Updated corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Fix the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

By making this change, the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
