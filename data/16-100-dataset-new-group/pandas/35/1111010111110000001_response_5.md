The bug appears to be located in the `_engine` cache readonly function within the `PeriodIndex` class in the pandas package. The error message is 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view''. The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` attempts to create a MultiIndex with PeriodIndex objects but raises an AttributeError due to issues in the `_engine` function.

The cause of the bug is likely due to how the weak reference to `self` is being handled within the `_engine` function. The weak reference might not be correctly handled when used inside the `_engine_type` constructor. The error message indicates that the weak reference results in a 'NoneType' object, which causes the AttributeError.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference and ensure that the instance of the `PeriodIndex` is kept alive while it's being used in the `_engine_type` constructor. This can be done by retrieving the strong reference from the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Retrieve the strong reference using the weak reference object
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    # Pass the strong reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This correction ensures that the weak reference doesn't result in a 'NoneType' object, avoiding the AttributeError identified in the failing test.
