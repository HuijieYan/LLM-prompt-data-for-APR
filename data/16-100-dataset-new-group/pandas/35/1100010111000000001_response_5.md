The issue with the `_engine` function is that it uses `cache_readonly` decorator, which may not be handling the weak reference properly, leading to a reference cycle and potential memory leaks. Additionally, the function returns the result of `self._engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self`, which could be causing the failure in the test.

To fix this issue, we should remove the `cache_readonly` decorator and modify the `_engine` function to properly handle weak references.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By removing the `cache_readonly` decorator and modifying the function to use weak references as intended, we ensure that there are no reference cycles and potential memory leaks. This should address the issue and allow the test to pass.
