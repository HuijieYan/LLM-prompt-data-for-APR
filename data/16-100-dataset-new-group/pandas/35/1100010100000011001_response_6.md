#### Expected input
- `self`: an instance of a class with a `_engine_type` attribute
- `len(self)`: an integer representing the length of the instance

#### Expected output
- A reference to the engine type with the weak reference to the `self` instance

### Analysis
The bug is likely to be caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref()` and the subsequent return statement. The `weakref.ref()` is meant to create a weak reference to the `self` instance, but it is being used incorrectly.

### Bug cause
The bug is caused by passing `self` directly to `weakref.ref()` without creating a weak reference, and then trying to use it as a weak reference in the return statement.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to the `self` instance using `weakref.ref()` and then use that weak reference in the return statement.

### The corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)  # Creating a weak reference to 'self'
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))  # Using the weak reference in the return statement
```
