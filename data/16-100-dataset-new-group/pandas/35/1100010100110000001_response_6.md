The buggy function `_engine` is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which means that the function result is cached and is only computed once. When the function is called again, the cached value is returned. This can lead to issues if the function depends on any mutable states, as the mutation won't be reflected in the cached value.

In the case of the failing test, the error message indicates that the attribute `view` is being called on a `NoneType` object within the `PeriodEngine` class which is likely being returned from the `_engine` method.

To fix the bug, the caching mechanism should be removed or modified to handle the mutation of the cached value. One way to do this is by using a property with a cached value instead of the `cache_readonly` decorator.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using a property decorator, the function will be computed each time it's called, avoiding issues with returning outdated or mutated cached values. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
