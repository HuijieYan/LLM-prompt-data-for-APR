The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to attempt to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and then pass it to the `_engine_type` method. However, it fails to properly create a weak reference, which can potentially lead to reference cycles and memory leaks.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be created properly to avoid any reference cycles. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas._libs import Period

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weakref is created using `weakref.proxy(self)` which allows access to the object while preventing strong references that would prevent the object from being garbage collected. This ensures that a proper weak reference is passed to the `_engine_type` method, fixing the potential memory leak issue.
