The bug in the function `_engine` is likely causing an issue because the `_engine_type` doesn't handle the weak reference correctly, resulting in a `NoneType` object for `self._engine`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference properly. Instead of passing a weak reference to `_engine_type`, we can pass `self` directly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is not causing the `NoneType` object error.

This fix should address the failing test and prevent the AttributeError.
