## Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is defined to return an instance of `self._engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` to it. The issue on GitHub describes the problem as weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in an error when running the failing test.

## Bug Locations
1. The weak reference `period` is not being used appropriately in the `_engine` function, which may lead to it being dropped prematurely.
2. The method `weakref.ref(self)` is used improperly, which causes the weak reference to become invalid too soon.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not maintained properly, resulting in the premature destruction of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before the intended use.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is used correctly and remains valid throughout its usage.

## Corrected Code
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly maintain a weak reference for self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, the weak reference to `self` will be appropriately maintained, ensuring that it remains valid throughout its usage in the `_engine` function. This should resolve the premature destruction of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` and fix the bug.
