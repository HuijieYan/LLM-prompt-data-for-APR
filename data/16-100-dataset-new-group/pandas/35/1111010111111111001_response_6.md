The bug in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` method. The `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object and hence resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The cause of the bug is likely in the `_engine` method, where `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is expected to return a valid object but is, in fact, returning a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid object and not a `NoneType` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type failed to return an engine")
    return engine
```
