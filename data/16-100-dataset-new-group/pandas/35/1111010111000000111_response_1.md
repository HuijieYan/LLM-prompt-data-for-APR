The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. When `weakref.ref` is called on an object, it returns a weak reference to the object, and calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` passing this weak reference instead of the original object. This results in the weak reference being dropped sooner than intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this, we should pass the original `self` to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this change, the `PeriodEngine` will receive the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and the issue described in the GitHub report should be resolved. The test case provided should pass with this corrected version.
