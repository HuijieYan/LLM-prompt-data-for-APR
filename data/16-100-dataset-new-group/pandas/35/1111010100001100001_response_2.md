The bug in the function `_engine` is that it is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, which is causing a reference cycle issue.

The cause of the bug is that the _engine function is trying to use weak referencing on `self` which is a PeriodIndex object. However, weak referencing is not being used correctly which is causing a reference cycle issue.

To fix the bug, the correct usage of weak referencing should be applied to avoid the reference cycle issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
