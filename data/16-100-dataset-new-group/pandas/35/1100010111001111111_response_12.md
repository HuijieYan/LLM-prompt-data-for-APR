The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex. When the PeriodIndex is weakly referenced, it is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is causing the failing test to raise an error.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex needs to be preserved until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to store the weak reference to the PeriodIndex using a variable that persists until the return statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex will be preserved until it is used by the PeriodEngine, resolving the issue and ensuring that the failing test will pass.
