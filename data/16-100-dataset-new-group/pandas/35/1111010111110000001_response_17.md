This is a bug related to the `_engine` property within the `PeriodIndex` class of the pandas library. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is causing an AttributeError because the `is_monotonic_increasing` method is trying to access the `_engine` property, which is returning a `NoneType` due to some internal issue.

It seems that the `_engine` function is using a decorator `@cache_readonly`, which is meant to be a read-only caching property and should not be a function. The error message indicates that the `_engine` property is returning a `NoneType`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, we should change the `_engine` function to be a read-only property so that it returns the cached value if it exists, or computes and caches the value if it doesn't exist.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@property
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By adding the `@property` decorator, we are converting the `_engine` method into a read-only property, and using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, we ensure that the property is cached after its first computation. This will store the correct engine type and avoid the `NoneType` error.

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_engine` function will pass the failing test.
