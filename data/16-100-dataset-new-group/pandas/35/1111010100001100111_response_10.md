### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the buggy function `_engine()` is likely related to the weak reference to `self` that is being passed to `_engine_type`. It appears that the weak reference might be getting dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is related to the weak reference to `self` being passed to `_engine_type`. As per the GitHub issue, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the PeriodIndex, which results in the error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained and not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by adjusting the handling of the weak reference and its usage within the `_engine()` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

In the corrected version, `len(self)` is replaced with `len(self._data)` to ensure that the length used in the `_engine_type` constructor is based on the underlying `_data` attribute of the PeriodIndex. This should maintain the weak reference to `self` and prevent the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
