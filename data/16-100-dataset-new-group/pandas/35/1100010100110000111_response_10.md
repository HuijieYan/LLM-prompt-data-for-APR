The buggy function is the `_engine` method in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`, and it is throwing an error related to weak references. The error message indicates that the `_do_monotonic_check` method is trying to access an attribute of a weakly-referenced object, leading to an `AttributeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not being properly handled, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` method to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
This version ensures that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained when passing it to `_engine_type`, preventing the `NoneType` error that was occurring in the original version.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
