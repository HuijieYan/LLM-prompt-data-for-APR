The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, which results in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This can be fixed by updating the `_engine` function to maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining a strong reference to the `self` object instead of using a weak reference, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not dropped prematurely, and the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference.

This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub, as it ensures that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` are not lost, and the expected output for the given test case should be True as intended.
