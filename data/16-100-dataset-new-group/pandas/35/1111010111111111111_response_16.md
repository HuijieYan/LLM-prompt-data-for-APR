To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the `_engine_type` is executed. The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To resolve the issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference until the `_engine_type` is executed:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By making this modification, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is required by the `_engine_type`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
