The buggy function `_engine` is causing the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail due to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should return the value of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` directly, without using weakref.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This corrected version addresses the issue reported on GitHub and resolves the problem with weak references in the PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex.
