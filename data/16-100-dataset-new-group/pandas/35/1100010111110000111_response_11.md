## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with test code, corresponding error message, the GitHub issue.

The buggy function is the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The function is being used by the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` file. When the test is run, it raises an error related to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" provides a detailed description of the problem. It explains that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. The expected output is that the test should return `True`, but it is currently failing.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.

The potential error in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)`. This weak reference might not be preserved as intended.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information.

The cause of the bug is related to the weak reference to the `self` object that is not preserved as intended. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object, as indicated in the error message.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is preserved as intended when creating the `_engine`. This might involve modifying the way the weak reference is created or ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely.

## Provide a corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is stored in the `period_ref` variable, and then passed to the `_engine_type` function. This should ensure that the weak reference is preserved as intended, fixing the bug.

By making this change, the weak reference to the `self` object will be maintained as expected, preventing the `NoneType` error and addressing the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
