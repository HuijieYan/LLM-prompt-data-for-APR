In the given buggy function, `_engine` is a cached readonly property of the `PeriodIndex` class. The purpose of this property is to initialize the internal engine of the `PeriodIndex` and return it. The property uses a weak reference to make sure there's no circular reference issue when instantiating the `PeriodEngine`.

The error that the failing test indicates is an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This indicates that the `_engine` property is returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object, causing subsequent operations to fail.

To fix this bug, one potential strategy is to ensure that the `_engine_type` method is used correctly while creating the instance of `PeriodEngine`. 

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._engine_type()
```

By checking the instance of `engine` before returning it, we ensure that the correct engine is initialized and that `None` is not returned inadvertently.

This corrected version should address the issue and make the failing test pass.
