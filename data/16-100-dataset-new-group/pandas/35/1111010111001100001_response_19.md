The bug in the `_engine` function appears to be related to the weak reference usage and the creation of the `_engine_type` object. The function is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex`, and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the length of the index. The goal of using a weak reference is likely to avoid creating a reference cycle, but the implementation seems to be incorrect.

The `weakref.ref` function creates a weak reference to the `self` object, so the `period` variable should not be directly used as an argument to `_engine_type`. Instead, the weak reference needs to be dereferenced using the `.()` syntax, which will return the original object if it still exists, or `None` if the original object has been garbage collected.

The incorrect implementation is likely causing the `_engine_type` to receive a weak reference object instead of the original `PeriodIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior and test failures.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be dereferenced before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of `period` as the argument to `_engine_type`, the weak reference will be dereferenced, and the original `self` object will be passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
