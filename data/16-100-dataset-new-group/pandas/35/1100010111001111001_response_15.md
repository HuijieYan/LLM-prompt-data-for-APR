The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly using the weakref functionality, which is causing a reference cycle problem.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly use weak references and avoid the reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can create a weak reference to `self` without causing a reference cycle. This will solve the issue of the failing test.

With this correction, the function should now work correctly and pass the failing test.
