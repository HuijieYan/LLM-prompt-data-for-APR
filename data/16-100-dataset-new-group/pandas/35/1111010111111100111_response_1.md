The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This causes an AttributeError when the engine tries to access the NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the execution of the _engine method.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def engine_type_wrapper(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)

    return engine_type_wrapper(period, len(self))
```

By creating a wrapper function, we prevent the weak reference to the PeriodIndex from being dropped prematurely, ensuring that the engine receives the correct reference and resolving the AttributeError issue.

After implementing this fix, the failing test should pass without any errors.
