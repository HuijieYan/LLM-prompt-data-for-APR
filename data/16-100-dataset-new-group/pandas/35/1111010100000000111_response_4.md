## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. The issue reported on GitHub also indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing the error reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is not dropped before intended. This can be done by modifying the `_engine` function to store the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` as an instance variable, thereby preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, month=None, quarter=None,
                 day=None, hour=None, minute=None, second=None, tz=None, dtype=None, name=None, **kwargs):
        pass
    
    def _engine(self):
        # Store a weak reference to self as an instance variable to prevent premature dropping
        if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
            self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `hasattr` to check if the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` exists as an instance variable. If not, we create a weak reference to `self` and store it as an instance variable `_period_weakref`. This prevents premature dropping of the weak reference and ensures that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.
