```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```
In the buggy function, the weakref of `self` is not being passed to the `_engine_type` function, which causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The corrected version of the function should pass `self` along with the weakref of `self` to the `_engine_type` function, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` gets the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

By adding `self` as an additional parameter in the return statement, the `PeriodIndex` reference is maintained and the bug is fixed.

```python
return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```
