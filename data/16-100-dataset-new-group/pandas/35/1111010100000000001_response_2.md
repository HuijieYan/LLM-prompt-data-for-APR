Based on the provided code, the buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The potential error locations are the use of `weakref.ref(self)` and the return statement that instantiates `_engine_type`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is trying to avoid a reference cycle by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference is not being properly utilized, and it may not be achieving the intended goal of avoiding a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, we should modify the implementation of the `_engine` function to properly use weak references and instantiate `_engine_type` with the weak reference of `self`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type and retrieve the strong reference from it.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we utilize the weak reference properly by calling it as a function `period()` to retrieve the strong reference to `self` when instantiating `_engine_type`.

By making this modification, we ensure that the weak reference is properly used to avoid reference cycles, and the `_engine` function is corrected.
