Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference to `self` being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive `None` instead of the PeriodIndex. This ultimately leads to the failing test in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be handled correctly to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely before the PeriodEngine receives it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is now immediately called with `()` to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

This fix should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and allow the failing test to pass.
