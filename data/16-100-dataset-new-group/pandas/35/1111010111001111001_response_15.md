The buggy function `_engine` has a potential error in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` which is not assigning the weak reference properly, leading to a reference cycle.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being properly used and is not preventing a reference cycle, which could lead to memory leaks.

To fix the bug, we need to properly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas import Period
from pandas import MultiIndex

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    ...
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can create a proper weak reference that does not create a reference cycle. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
