The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the `is_monotonic` method to fail, resulting in an AttributeError. The bug occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `_engine_type`, which is responsible for creating the engine. This will prevent the NoneType object error and resolve the failing test for the `is_monotonic` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    period_index = period()
    engine._period_index = period_index
    return engine
```
In the corrected version, we store the weak reference `period` in the `PeriodEngine` object, and then we extract the `PeriodIndex` from the weak reference and store it in the engine as `_period_index`. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed.

After implementing this fix, the failing test should pass, and the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved.
