## Explanation:

The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object, leading to the failing test and error message. This is happening because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` needs to be handled correctly in the `_engine` function to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```
