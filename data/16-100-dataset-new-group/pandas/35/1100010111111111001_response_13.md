The issue seems to be with the `_engine_type` method call, which is resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned. This is likely happening because the `weakref.ref(self)` is not being used correctly.

To fix this, we can pass `self` directly to the `_engine_type` method, instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the function should now return the correct engine type and fix the `NoneType` object error.
