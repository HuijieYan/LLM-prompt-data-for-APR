The problem with the current implementation of the `_engine` function is that it creates a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`, but then immediately passes it to `self._engine_type` without maintaining a strong reference to the object. This can cause the weak reference to be garbage collected prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used in `self._engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function 
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period_strongref = period_weakref()
    return self._engine_type(period_strongref, len(self))
```

By creating a strong reference `period_strongref` to the weak reference object returned by `period_weakref()`, we ensure that the object `self` is not prematurely garbage collected before being used in `self._engine_type`.

With this correction, the function should now correctly maintain the weak reference to `self` and resolve the issue posted on GitHub. The failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass without raising an error.
