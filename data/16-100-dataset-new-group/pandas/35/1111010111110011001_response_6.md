Currently, the buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. This is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute. The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is being used as a direct reference, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the correct strategy is to use the weakref's reference attribute (`period`) when calling the `_engine_type` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
