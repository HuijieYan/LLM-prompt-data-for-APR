## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError. This is in line with the GitHub issue description, which also mentions that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the `_engine` function where it creates a weak reference to `self`. It seems that the weak reference is not being maintained properly, leading to the `NoneType` error.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, resulting in a `None` value being passed to the `PeriodEngine` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained properly and not dropped prematurely. This may involve revisiting the use of weak references and ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` remains valid when passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

## Corrected Version
```python
from pandas.util._decorators import cache_readonly

# The corrected version of the function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
