There seems to be a bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is supposed to return the `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `self` object, but it seems to be doing so incorrectly.

The bug is likely to be in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, where it should be `period = weakref.ref(self._values)` because `_engine_type` requires the period values, not the entire `PeriodIndex` object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self._values)`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
