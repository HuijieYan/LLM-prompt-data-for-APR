The problem with the buggy function `_engine` is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference. However, the weak reference is not being properly handled, leading to the error 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This is because the weak reference `period` is being dropped before it is intended to be used in the `_engine_type`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly handled and not dropped prematurely. We can modify the function to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` as intended. We can use the `weakref.proxy()` function to create a weak reference that doesn't get dropped until the last reference to the original object is removed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` will be properly handled and used in the `_engine_type` function. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the test passes with the expected output.
