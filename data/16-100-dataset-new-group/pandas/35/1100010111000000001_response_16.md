The issue in the buggy function is likely to be related to the `weakref.ref` usage and its relationship with the `_engine_type` being called. 

The bug in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function fails because it tries to create a `MultiIndex` object from `PeriodIndex` objects using `_get_level_values` method, which in turn relies on the `_engine` method of `PeriodIndex`. The `_engine` method is expected to return a unique engine object for the given period index.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_engine` function to ensure it returns the correct engine object without any reference cycle issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy()` instead of `weakref.ref()`, we can create a non-breaking weak reference to the `self` object without causing reference cycles. This will allow the `_engine_type` to create the engine object for the `PeriodIndex` without any issues.

After applying this fix, the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function should pass without any issues.
