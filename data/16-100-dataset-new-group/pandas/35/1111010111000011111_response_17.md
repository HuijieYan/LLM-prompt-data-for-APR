Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to weak referencing in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in an error when checking if all values are monotonic.

To fix this issue, instead of using weak references in the `_engine` function, a regular reference to `self` can be used to instantiate the `PeriodEngine` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By using a regular reference to `self` instead of a weak reference, the `PeriodEngine` will receive the correct `PeriodIndex` object and the test case should now pass, returning `True` as expected. This should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
