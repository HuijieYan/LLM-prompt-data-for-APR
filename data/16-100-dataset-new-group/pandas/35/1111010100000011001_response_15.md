#### Expected values and types of relevant variables
- period: weakref reference to self
- Return: _engine_type(period, len(self))

### Potential issues in the buggy function
The use of weakref.ref() may not be suitable for creating a weak reference cycle, potentially leading to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

### Bug explanation
The bug occurs due to the incorrect usage of weakref.ref() when creating a weak reference to self. This may not break the reference cycle as intended, leading to potential issues with memory management and unexpected behavior.

### Fix strategy
Instead of using weakref.ref(), use weakref.proxy() to create a weak reference to self. This approach provides a better way to handle weak reference cycles and ensures proper memory management.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
