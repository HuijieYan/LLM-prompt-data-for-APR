The bug is in the `_engine` function, which is used to create a weak reference to `self` and then use it to instantiate an `_engine_type` using the weak reference containing `self`. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', meaning that the weak reference to `self` is not being properly instantiated or passed to `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be accessed properly to ensure it's not `None` before using it with `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:  # Check if weakref is not None
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
This correction includes a conditional check to verify if the weak reference is not None before using it to instantiate `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly established and used to prevent the 'NoneType' object error.
