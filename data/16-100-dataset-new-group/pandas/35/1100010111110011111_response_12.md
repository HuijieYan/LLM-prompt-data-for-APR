Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError when the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is executed. The bug may be related to weak references or how the PeriodEngine handles weak references.

The expected input and output values are not explicitly mentioned, but it is clear that the buggy function `_engine` is not handling weak references properly, which leads to the AttributeError when accessing the view attribute.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" provides more insight into the problem. It mentions that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function needs to be revisited to ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex instead of a NoneType object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period():
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self is not available")
```

In the corrected version, a check is added to ensure that the weak reference `period` is still available before passing it to the `_engine_type`. If the weak reference is not available, it raises a ValueError indicating that the weak reference to self is not available. This approach ensures that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex and prevents the AttributeError from occurring.
