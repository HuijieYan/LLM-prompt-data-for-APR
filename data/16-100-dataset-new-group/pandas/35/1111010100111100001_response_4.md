The bug is likely due to the `_engine` function returning a `None` instead of an instance of `PeriodEngine`. This is causing the `PeriodEngine`'s attribute `vgetter` to be `None`, leading to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of `PeriodEngine` rather than `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine could not be created")
    return engine
```

By checking if the engine is `None` and raising a `ValueError` if so, we ensure that the `_engine` function always returns a valid `PeriodEngine` instance.

This correction should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test passes.
