The buggy function is a method named `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. It uses the `@cache_readonly` decorator, implying that the result of the function is cached after the first call.

The function takes a `self` parameter, which is an instance of a `PeriodIndex` object, and returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` object `idx` and then creates another `MultiIndex` object `idx2` by calling `idx._get_level_values(level)` in a loop. The failure occurs because the returned `idx2` does not have monotonic levels as expected.

### Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it uses a weak reference `period` of the `self` object but does not use this weak reference when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This may lead to reference cycles and unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be properly utilized when calling `self._engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Import the required packages
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
