The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error is occurring in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. The failing assertion is due to the fact that `self._engine` on `idx2 levels` returns `None`, leading to the `AttributeError`.

The cause of this issue is the implementation of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The `@cache_readonly` decorator suggests that `_engine` should generate a cached value, but unfortunately it returns a `NoneType` object, leading to attribute errors.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to correctly generate and return an instance of `PeriodEngine` with the appropriate attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = PeriodEngine(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
    return period
```

With this change, the _engine function should correctly return an instance of `PeriodEngine` with the required attributes, allowing the failing test to pass.
