The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before its intended scope, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error when trying to access the `view` attribute in the `_do_monotonic_check` method in `pandas/_libs/index.pyx`. The error message is raised in the unit test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` defined in the `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` file.

The buggy function is as follows:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a reference to self until the PeriodEngine is created
    ref_to_self = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(ref_to_self, len(self))
    return engine
```

By maintaining a reference to `self` using `ref_to_self` until the `PeriodEngine` is created, we ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely, preventing the `NoneType` error. This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.

This fix is in line with the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" which describes a similar problem.
