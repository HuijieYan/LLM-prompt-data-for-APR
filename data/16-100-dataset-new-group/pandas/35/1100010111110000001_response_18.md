The core of the issue is that the `_engine` method is returning `None`, which leads to the AttributeError in the failing test function. One potential cause of this bug is that the caching mechanism of the `_engine` method is not working as expected and is returning `None` instead of a valid engine.

To fix this issue, we should revisit the caching mechanism and ensure that the `_engine` method correctly returns the engine instance instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if hasattr(self, '_engine_type'):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        return super()._engine
```

In this corrected version, we check if the `self` instance has the attribute `_engine_type`. If it does, we create the engine and return it as before. If it doesn't, we call the base class's `_engine` method to retrieve the engine.

This should address the caching issue and ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid engine instance, resolving the AttributeError in the failing test.
