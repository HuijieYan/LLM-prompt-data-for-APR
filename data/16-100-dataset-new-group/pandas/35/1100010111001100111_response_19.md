The issue with the buggy function is that it's not correctly handling the weak reference to the self object. This is causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the self object is properly handled and doesn't get dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly dereferenced and doesn't get dropped prematurely, thereby providing the PeriodEngine with the correct PeriodIndex.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
