The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the use of `weakref.ref(self)` and the subsequent call to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This may be causing the function to return unexpected values or cause unexpected behavior when used in the failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

The cause of the bug can be identified by analyzing the relationship between the input parameters of the function and the expected behavior during the failing test execution. It seems that the function should return an object that has monotonic levels for each element in the `idx2.levels` list.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to directly return the result of `self._engine_type(self, len(self))` without using weak references.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This corrected version of the function changes the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, which should resolve the issues with the failing test case.
