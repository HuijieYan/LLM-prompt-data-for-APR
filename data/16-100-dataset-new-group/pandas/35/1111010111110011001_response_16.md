The buggy function `_engine` is using a cached read-only decorator `@cache_readonly`, which is causing the error. It seems that the `_engine_type` function is taking a weak reference of `self`, which is causing the `NoneType` error when accessing the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, the cached read-only decorator should be removed from the `_engine` function. Instead, the `_engine` method should generate and return a weak reference of `self` to be used by the `_engine_type` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By removing the cached read-only decorator, the weak reference of `self` can be correctly passed to the `_engine_type` function, resolving the `NoneType` attribute error.
