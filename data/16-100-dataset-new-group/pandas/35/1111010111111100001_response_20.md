The cause of the bug is that the `_engine_type` is returning a `NoneType` object when the `_engine` function is called. This is leading to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid object and does not return None.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Engine creation failed")
```

In this corrected version, after calling `_engine_type`, we check if the returned engine is valid. If it is, we return it. Otherwise, we raise a `ValueError` to indicate that the engine creation failed. This ensures that the `_engine` function does not return a `NoneType` object, preventing the `AttributeError` in the failing test.
