The buggy function `_engine` is failing to properly create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This results in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped too early, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `weakref.ref` should be used to create a weak reference to `self` and then that should be passed to `_engine_type`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is properly created and passed to `_engine_type`, preventing the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, and ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as intended. This should resolve the issue and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
