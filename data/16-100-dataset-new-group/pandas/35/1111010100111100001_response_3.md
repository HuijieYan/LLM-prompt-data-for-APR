The cause of the bug is that the `_engine_type` method is returning a `NoneType` object, causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns the correct type of object.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type method returned NoneType object")
    return engine
```

By adding a check for `None` and raising a `ValueError` in case the `_engine_type` method returns a `NoneType` object, we ensure that the correct type of object is returned by the `_engine` method.
