### Analyis
The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return an instance of `self._engine_type`. However, the buggy function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. This is causing an issue as `_engine_type` expects the actual instance of `self` rather than a weak reference.

### Bug
The bug is caused by incorrectly passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, causing it to not receive the actual instance of `self` and leading to unexpected behavior when calling the returned instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the `weakref.ref` and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` in the `_engine` function.

### The corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
