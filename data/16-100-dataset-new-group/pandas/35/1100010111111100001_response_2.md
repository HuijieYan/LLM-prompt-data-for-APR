The bug is likely caused by the `_engine_type` method returning a `NoneType` object. This causes an `AttributeError` when `view("i8")` is called on the `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_engine_type` returns a valid object and does not return `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```

By checking if the `_engine_type` method returns `None` and raising a `ValueError` if it does, we ensure that the `_engine` function always returns a valid object.

After making this change, the failing test should pass.
