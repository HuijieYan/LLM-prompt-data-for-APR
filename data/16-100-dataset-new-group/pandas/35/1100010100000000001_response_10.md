## Analysis:
The buggy function is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that it is meant to cache the result of the function and return the cached result instead of re-computing it on subsequent calls. However, the function is not using any mechanism to actually cache the result.

## Potential Error:
The potential error is that the function is not caching the result, and it will recompute the result every time it is called, which defeats the purpose of using `@cache_readonly`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly using the `@cache_readonly` decorator to cache the result of the `_engine` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to actually cache the result of the `_engine` function when it is computed for the first time, and return the cached result on subsequent calls.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._cached_engine
```
