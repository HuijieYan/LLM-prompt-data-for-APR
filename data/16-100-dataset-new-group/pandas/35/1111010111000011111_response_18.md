The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` (an instance of PeriodIndex) and then passing it to `_engine_type` to create an object. However, the weak reference may be getting dropped before intended, causing the `_engine_type` to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the usage of weak reference should be revised to ensure that the reference to `self` remains valid when passed to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This version removes the weak reference and instead directly passes `self` to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue and ensure that `_engine_type` receives a valid reference to the PeriodIndex.
