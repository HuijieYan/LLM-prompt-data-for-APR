Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused because the `_engine_type` function is expecting a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, but the original reference is being passed. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the view attribute of a `NoneType` object.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and pass that weak reference to the `_engine_type` function as expected.

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    ...
    """

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
