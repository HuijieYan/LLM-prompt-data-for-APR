The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and then pass it to the `_engine_type` method to create an engine instance. The potential error locations in this function are:
1. The weak reference creation may not be working as intended.
2. The `self._engine_type` method call may not be receiving the weak reference correctly.

The cause of the bug could be that the weak reference is not being properly created, leading to a potential reference cycle and memory leak.

To fix the bug, we can use the `weakref.proxy` function to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to the `_engine_type` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
