The buggy function `_engine` is being called at some point during the failing test. The function is using a `cache_readonly` decorator which is meant to calculate the method once and cache the result. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the function is returning `None` instead of the expected type.

The function is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which indicates that the issue is likely with the `self._engine_type` method which is expected to return a certain type, but it is instead returning `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to investigate the implementation of `self._engine_type` and ensure that it returns the expected type. This may involve debugging the `_engine_type` method to understand why it is returning `None` instead of the expected value.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if result is None:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return result
```
