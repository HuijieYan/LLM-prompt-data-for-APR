To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should return weak references to avoid a reference cycle. The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This causes the `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view' error.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self is not None else None
```

This corrected version returns `None` when `self` is `None`, avoiding the AttributeError issue.

By implementing this corrected version, the failing test should pass without any AttributeError issues.
