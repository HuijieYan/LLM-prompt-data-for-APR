The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. This is incorrect because `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference object that returns None when the original object is deleted, and this is not what we want in this case. 

To fix the bug, we should simply pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor without creating a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this fix, the function should pass the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.
