## Analysis:
The bug is related to the weak reference of the PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The weak reference creation `period = weakref.ref(self)` may not be functioning as intended and may be dropping the reference too early.

## Cause of the Bug:
The weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being dropped prematurely, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, and that it remains accessible to the PeriodEngine when needed.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period(), len(self))
```
In the corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)` is passed inside a lambda function that returns the weak reference when called, and this lambda function is passed to `_engine_type`, addressing the premature dropping of the weak reference.
