## Buggy Function Analysis:

The buggy function is a method called `_engine` within a class. It is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that the result of the function should be cached and returned on subsequent calls.

Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` might not be capturing a weak reference correctly.
2. There might be an issue with the `self._engine_type` function or its arguments.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely to be caused by incorrect usage of weak references or incorrect arguments passed to the `_engine_type` function.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference is correctly captured.
2. Check the documentation for the `_engine_type` function to ensure that the correct arguments are being passed.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```
