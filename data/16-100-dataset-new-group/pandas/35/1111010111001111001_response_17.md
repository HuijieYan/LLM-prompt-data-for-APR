The bug in the provided function is that the `weakref.ref` function is being used incorrectly, which leads to a reference cycle and potential memory leaks. The `weakref.ref` function should be used to create a weak reference to the object, but the return value of `weakref.ref(self)` is then being passed directly to `self._engine_type`.

To fix this bug, the `weakref.ref` should be called with `self` as an argument to create a weak reference, and then the reference should be accessed using the `()` operator to retrieve the referenced object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# import weakref if not already imported
# import weakref

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).

    """

    # corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By making this change, the weak reference to `self` is properly created and then accessed using the `()` operator to retrieve the referenced object, resolving the reference cycle issue and potential memory leaks.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
