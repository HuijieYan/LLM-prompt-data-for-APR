The issue with the bug is that the `_engine_type` method is being called with a weak reference to `self`, but the weak reference is being lost before it's used, resulting in a `NoneType` error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it's actually used in the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    def engine_caller():
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_caller
```

In this corrected version, we wrap the call to `_engine_type` in a closure, so that the weak reference is maintained until it's actually used. This should address the issue and ensure that the weak reference is not lost prematurely.
