### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using the `cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that it's intended to be a read-only cached property. The error message suggests that the bug is related to an attribute error on a `NoneType` object, indicating that the `_engine_type` attribute might be returning `None` instead of an expected object.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` function is not handling the case where `self._engine_type` is returning `None` instead of an actual engine type object. This leads to the error when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by implementing a mechanism to handle the case where `self._engine_type` returns `None`. This could involve checking the result of `self._engine_type` and returning an appropriate default value if it's `None`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine:
        return engine
    else:
        # Default behavior when _engine_type returns None
        return SomeDefaultValue
```
Replace `SomeDefaultValue` with the appropriate default value that the function should return when `_engine_type` is `None`.
