The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference usage and its interaction with the `_engine_type` initialization. The error message indicates an issue with the `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` call, suggesting that the `_engine` attribute is not being properly initialized.

The cause of the bug could be that when creating the weak reference to `self`, it is not being properly captured by the `_engine_type` initialization, resulting in a `NoneType` object when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly managed and accessible within the `_engine_type` initialization, so that it is not destroyed prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

In this corrected version, the `weakref.ref(self)` is used to create a weak reference to `self`, and then this reference is passed to the `_engine_type` initialization to ensure that it is properly captured and used within the engine object. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `_engine` attribute is properly initialized and accessible, resolving the AttributeError mentioned in the error message.
