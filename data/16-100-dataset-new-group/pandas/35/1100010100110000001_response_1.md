## Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an 'AttributeError' due to a 'NoneType' object that has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that there is an issue with the 'PeriodEngine' in the pandas library.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Use of `weakref.ref(self)` method to create a weak reference to the 'self' object.
2. Returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which is expected to be the 'PeriodEngine'.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is likely that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` may not be properly handling the reference to the 'self' object, resulting in a 'None' object being passed to `self._engine_type` and causing the 'AttributeError' when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

## Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference to the 'self' object is properly handled so that the 'PeriodEngine' is correctly created and returned without causing the 'AttributeError'.


## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)  # Updated line to use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
