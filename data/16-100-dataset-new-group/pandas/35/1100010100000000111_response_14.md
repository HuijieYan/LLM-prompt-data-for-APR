## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only function that returns the engine type for the PeriodIndex. The issue on GitHub describes a problem with weak referencing of PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, causing the engine to receive `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The weak ref is not being used correctly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving `None`.
2. The cached read-only function may not be handling the weak referencing properly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is related to the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex in the MultiIndex, where the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use weak referencing correctly to ensure that the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.
2. Modify the cached read-only function to handle weak referencing properly and ensure that the engine receives a valid PeriodIndex.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _engine(self):
    # Use weak referencing correctly
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Check if the weak reference is still valid
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case where the weak reference is no longer valid
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is no longer valid")
```

By using weak referencing correctly and checking if the weak reference is still valid before creating the engine type, this corrected version addresses the issue described on GitHub and ensures that the engine receives a valid PeriodIndex.
