The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the error. The bug is related to dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` too early, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be managed properly to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # Don't use weakref to avoid premature dropping of the reference
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we remove the weak reference and directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

With this fix, the failing test should pass, and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
