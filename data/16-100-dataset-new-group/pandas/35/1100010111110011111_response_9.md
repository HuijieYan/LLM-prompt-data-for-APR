The issue appears to be related to the weakrefs in the `_engine` function not being handled properly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` value instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the weak reference to `self` is not properly handled, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access an attribute of the weak reference.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` should be properly constructed and handled to avoid the `NoneType` error.

One potential fix for this bug could be to use the `weakref.proxy` function to create a weak reference that behaves like a normal reference when accessed, to ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the intended PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This correction should address the weak reference issue and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the intended PeriodIndex.
