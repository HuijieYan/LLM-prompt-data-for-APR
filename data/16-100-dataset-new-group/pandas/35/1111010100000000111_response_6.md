The cause of the bug:
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, which is dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before it is intended. This results in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing the issue described in the GitHub post.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, allowing the `PeriodEngine` to receive the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex`. This can be done by adjusting the weak reference handling within the `_engine` function.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected version, `weakref.ref` is replaced with `weakref.proxy` to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is retained until needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This prevents the issue described in the GitHub post.
