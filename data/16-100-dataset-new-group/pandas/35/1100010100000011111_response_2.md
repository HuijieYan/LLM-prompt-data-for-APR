The issue seems to be related to the weak reference of the PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is likely the cause of the bug in the _engine function.

To fix this issue, we can modify the _engine function to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until the engine has finished using it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to maintain a weak reference to the PeriodIndex until the engine has finished using it. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the engine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.
