## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `@cache_readonly` decorator is used, which means that the function should be cached and should only be computed once and then stored for future use.
2. The use of `weakref.ref` within the function may lead to a reference cycle issue.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is using a weak reference (`weakref.ref`) to create the `period` variable, which might result in a reference cycle issue. This could lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior, as the weak reference could prevent the object from being garbage collected. Additionally, the `@cache_readonly` decorator indicates that this function should be cached and only computed once, but the weak reference usage may prevent the caching from working as intended.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a different approach to avoid reference cycles and potential memory leaks.
2. Ensure that the caching behavior is consistent with the `@cache_readonly` decorator.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, I removed the weak reference usage and used `self` directly to create the `period` variable. This ensures that there is no risk of reference cycles, and the caching behavior is consistent with the `@cache_readonly` decorator.
