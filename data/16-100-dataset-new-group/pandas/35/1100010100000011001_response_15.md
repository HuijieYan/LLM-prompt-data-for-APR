### Analysis
The function is defined as a `cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that it is intended to be a cached property. The function creates a weak reference to `self` and then calls `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self` as arguments.

The potential error location is the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. This could cause the weak reference to be immediately garbage collected if there are no other references to `self`.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` may be collected before it is used, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we can use the `weakref.proxy` method to create a weak proxy to `self` instead of creating a weak reference directly.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
