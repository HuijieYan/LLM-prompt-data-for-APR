The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly returning the _engine_type with the weakref of self. This can lead to a reference cycle, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this, we need to update the _engine function to use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref to avoid the reference cycle. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using weakref.proxy, we can avoid the reference cycle and ensure that the _engine_type function receives the weak reference to self without causing any unexpected behavior.

With this fix, the function should now correctly return the _engine_type with the weakref proxy of self, satisfying the expected input/output values for the given test case.
