Based on the error message and the provided runtime values and types of the input parameters, it seems that the issue arises from the weakref not being properly maintained. The function is supposed to create a weakref of the `self` object and pass it to `_engine_type`, but it seems that the weakref is not being created correctly, resulting in the `_engine` returning a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakref is properly created and maintained throughout the function. Additionally, we need to verify the implementation of the `_engine_type` function to ensure it handles weakrefs correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weakref of self to avoid reference cycles
    weak_self = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we import `ref` explicitly from the `weakref` module. Then, we create a weakref of `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycles and maintain the weak reference correctly. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and pass the failing test.
