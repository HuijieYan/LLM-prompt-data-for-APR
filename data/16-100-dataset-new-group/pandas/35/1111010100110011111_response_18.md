To fix the bug in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained correctly to avoid it being dropped prematurely.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being handled properly in the `_engine` method, leading to it being dropped and resulting in a `NoneType` object being accessed.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to use a weak reference to `self` and ensure that it is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By using a weak reference to `self` and storing it in a variable `period_weakref`, we ensure that the reference to `self` is not lost prematurely, fixing the bug that caused the `NoneType` object error.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
