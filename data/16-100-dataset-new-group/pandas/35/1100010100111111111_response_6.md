The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the AttributeError 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This is causing the failing test to raise an error.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is being handled properly and the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weakly referenced PeriodIndex is None")
```

With this correction, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is checked before use, preventing the `PeriodEngine` from receiving a None object. This should resolve the issue and the failing test should now pass.
