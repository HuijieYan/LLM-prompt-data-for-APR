The error message seems to be caused by the problematic `PeriodEngine` object's `vgetter` property, and specifically, the `NoneType` object that it is trying to access. This suggests that the `_engine` function is not returning the expected `PeriodEngine` object, potentially returning a `None` pointer instead.

To resolve the issue, we should check the implementation of the `_engine` function to ensure that it correctly initializes and returns a `PeriodEngine` object. This means examining the initialization of `PeriodEngine` within the `_engine_type`, noting any potential issues with the weak reference `period` and how it is initialized.

Here's the corrected fixed function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self), period)
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference `period` is passed alongside `self` and the length of the object to `_engine_type` for the `PeriodIndex` object when acquiring the `PeriodEngine` instance. This modification primarily aims to ensure the proper initialization of the `PeriodEngine` while avoiding the `NoneType` object arising from the previous implementation.
