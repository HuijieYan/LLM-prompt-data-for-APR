The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex, resulting in the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error. The expected output should be True for the failing test case provided.

In order to fix this bug, the _engine function should be modified to correctly handle the weakref.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.proxy(self)  # Use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref, we ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped before intended, which should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
