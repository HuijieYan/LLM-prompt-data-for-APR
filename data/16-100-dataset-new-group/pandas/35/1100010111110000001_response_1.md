In the given buggy function, the `@cache_readonly` decorator is used to cache the `_engine` method of the class. The method returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which receives a weak reference to `self` as an argument.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` attempts to create `idx2` using the `idx._get_level_values(level)` function for each level, and then checks if `idx2.levels` are monotonic using the `is_monotonic` property.

The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` raised within the `pandas._libs.index.IndexEngine.is_monotonic_increasing` function, which is caused by the `return self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` statement.

The bug is likely due to an issue with the `self._engine_type` method in the `_engine` function, which results in the `self._engine` attribute being set to `None` instead of a valid object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine_type` method should be checked for any errors that might be causing it to return `None`, and the logic should be adjusted to ensure that a valid engine object is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# fixed _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type is None")
    return engine
```

In the corrected version, the `_engine` function is modified to handle the case where `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returns `None`. It raises a `ValueError` in such a scenario to indicate the issue.
