The buggy function `_engine` is causing an issue when weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to raise an error instead of returning `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), weakref.ref)
```

In this corrected version, we pass the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` as an argument to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference is maintained until it's no longer needed. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
