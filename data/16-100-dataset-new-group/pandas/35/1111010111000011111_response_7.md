To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to address the weakly referenced PeriodIndex that is being dropped before it is intended to. This is causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The cause of the bug is the use of weakref.ref to create a weak reference to self while instantiating the PeriodEngine. The weakref.ref should be replaced with weakref.proxy in order to pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The use of `weakref.proxy` ensures that a weak, rather than strong, reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, preventing a premature dropping of the reference.

With this correction, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass and return True as per the expected output mentioned in the GitHub issue.
