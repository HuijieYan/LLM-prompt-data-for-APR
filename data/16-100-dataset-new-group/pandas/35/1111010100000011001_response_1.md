#### Bug in the buggy function:
The `_engine` function is using the `cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that it is intended to be a read-only cached property. However, it seems that it is not being used as intended, as there are no inputs to this function and it doesn't return anything, making the caching unnecessary. It appears that the intention is to create an instance of `_engine_type` and return it.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
Remove the `cache_readonly` decorator and modify the function to create an instance of `_engine_type` using weak referencing and return it.

#### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
