The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the error by returning a `NoneType` object. The root cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` is created. This can be achieved by using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` when creating the weak reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy`, we maintain a reference to `self` until the `PeriodEngine` is created, ensuring that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely.

This corrected version should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
