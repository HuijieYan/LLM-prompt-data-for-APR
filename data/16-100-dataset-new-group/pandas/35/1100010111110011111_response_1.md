The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return a reference to an engine type using a weak reference to the `self` object. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` and attempts to retrieve the level values, but encounters an error due to a `NoneType` object being used in the `idx2` object. This is related to the issue posted on GitHub regarding weak references being dropped prematurely.

The cause of the bug is due to premature dropping of weakly referenced objects within the `_engine` function, leading to a `NoneType` object being returned instead of the expected engine type. This causes errors to be raised when operating on the `idx2` object.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weakly referenced objects are kept alive for the duration that they are expected to be used. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to maintain a strong reference to the `self` object for as long as it is being used within the engine.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a strong reference to self during the engine's operation
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By maintaining a strong reference to the `self` object, we ensure that it remains alive for the duration of the engine's operation, resolving the premature dropping of weak references. This corrected version should satisfy the failing test, the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
