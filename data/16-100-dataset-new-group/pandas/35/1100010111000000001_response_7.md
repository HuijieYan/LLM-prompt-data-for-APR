The issue in the _engine function is that it should take a weak reference to self and then call the _engine_type with the weak reference as the first argument. This is not being done in the current implementation, which is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we should modify the _engine function to correctly create a weak reference to self and then pass it to the _engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from weakref import ref  # import the necessary module

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)  # create a weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the _engine function should now correctly handle weak references and pass them to the _engine_type, satisfying the failing test.
