The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The purpose of `weakref.ref` is to create a weak reference to an object, allowing the object to be garbage collected if there are no strong references to it. However, in this case, it seems that the intention is to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but `weakref.ref` is not being used in the right way.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the use of `weakref.ref` and in the call to `self._engine_type`.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_engine` is not properly creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`, possibly resulting in a reference cycle and the object not being garbage collected properly.

To fix the bug, the correct way to use `weakref.ref` is to create a weak reference and then access the referenced object using the `()` syntax. Additionally, ensure that `_engine_type` is called with the correct arguments.

Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`, avoiding any potential reference cycles. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
