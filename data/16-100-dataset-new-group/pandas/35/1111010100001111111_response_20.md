To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class to properly pass a weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor. This will ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely before the engine is initialized.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type to avoid a reference cycle.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

In the corrected version, we are passing `self._data` to the `len` function to get the length of the underlying data instead of directly calling `len(self)`. This ensures that we are obtaining the correct length of the data to initialize the engine correctly.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.
