The issue in the code is that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being lost before it's intended to be. This causes the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the failing test.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it's intended to be dropped.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

In the corrected version, I have passed a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` without dropping the weak reference early. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
