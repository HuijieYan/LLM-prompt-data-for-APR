The buggy function `_engine` is currently returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The error message indicates an AttributeError, `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which means the function `_engine_type` might be returning None unexpectedly. The failing test's runtime input shows that `self` is a `PeriodIndex` and its values are `['2019Q1', '2019Q2']`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function does not return None and returns the expected type. We also need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly used.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if result is None:
        return self._default_engine_type()
    else:
        return result
```

This corrected version checks if the result from `_engine_type` is None, and if so, returns the default engine type instead. By adding this check, we ensure that the `_engine` function does not return None unexpectedly and provides the expected output for the failing test.
