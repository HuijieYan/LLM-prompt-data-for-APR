The primary cause of the bug is the `_engine` function. It is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which seems to be misbehaving. When it should return a `PeriodEngine` object, it's likely returning `None` in some cases, leading to the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error.

A suggested strategy for fixing this bug is to change the decorator for the `_engine` function from `@cache_readonly` to `@property` and manage the caching manually within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
    @property
    def _engine(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine_cache'):
            period = weakref.ref(self)
            self._engine_cache = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        return self._engine_cache
```

In this corrected version, the `_engine` function has been changed to a property and now manually manages the caching of the `PeriodEngine` object. This should prevent the previously observed errors when accessing `is_monotonic` on the `idx2.levels` object. The test should now pass with the corrected code.
