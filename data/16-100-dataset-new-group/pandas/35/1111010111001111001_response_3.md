To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to remove the `@cache_readonly` decorator from the function. The issue is likely related to the caching behavior of the function, which may be causing unexpected behavior when creating the engine instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By removing the `@cache_readonly` decorator, we eliminate the caching behavior, which may be causing the unexpected results in the failing test. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function produces the expected output.
