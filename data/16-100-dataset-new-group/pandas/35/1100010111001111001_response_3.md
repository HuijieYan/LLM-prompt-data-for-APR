The buggy function is using a weak reference to the `self` parameter and then calling `_engine_type` with that weak reference and the length of the `self` parameter. However, the weak reference is not being dereferenced, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
