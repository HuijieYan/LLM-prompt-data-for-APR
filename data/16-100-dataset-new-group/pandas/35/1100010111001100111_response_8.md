The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The issue is related to the weak reference being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the creation of the weak reference should be modified to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely and the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as expected.

This fix should address the bug and make the failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in GitHub titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".
