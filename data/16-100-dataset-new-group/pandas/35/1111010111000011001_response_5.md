### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using a `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then pass it to `_engine_type`. The purpose is to avoid a reference cycle. However, the problem here is that `weakref.ref` returns a weak reference object, not the original object, which is then being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to pass the original `self` object to `_engine_type` instead of the weak reference. 

### The Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
