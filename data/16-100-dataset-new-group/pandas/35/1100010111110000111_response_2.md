The buggy function `_engine` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is causing an error when trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

The cause of the bug is the weak reference being dropped before intended, which results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we can revise the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference and ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

In this corrected version, we check if the weak reference `period` is not None before returning the `_engine_type`. If it is None, we return None, preventing the issue described in the bug report.

This revised function should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
