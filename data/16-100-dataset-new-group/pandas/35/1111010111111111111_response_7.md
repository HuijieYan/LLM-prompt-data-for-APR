To fix the bug, it seems that the weak reference to `self` is not being maintained properly, leading to a `NoneType` error in the `_engine` attribute. We should ensure that the weak reference is properly preserved and accessed within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This change ensures that the weak reference is properly checked before accessing it. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
