The bug in the given function is that the weak reference `period` is being created but not utilized in the `_engine_type` constructor. This can lead to potential reference cycles, defeating the purpose of using the weak reference.

To fix the bug, we should use the weak reference `period` when calling the `_engine_type` constructor, ensuring that the reference cycle is broken and memory is effectively managed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# bug-fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are calling the `period` weak reference as a function `period()` when passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This ensures that we are passing the weak reference of `self` and breaking the reference cycle.

With this fix, the function should now work as intended and manage memory efficiently.
