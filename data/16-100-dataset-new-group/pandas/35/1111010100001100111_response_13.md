## Potential Error Location
The potential error is likely occurring due to the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before intended. This is resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the bug.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is retained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine. This can be achieved by modifying the _engine function to properly handle the weak reference.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Retain a weak reference to self for the duration of _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Ensure period is still alive
    if period() is not None:
        return engine_result
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weakly referenced PeriodIndex object has been dropped.")
```

In the corrected version, we first retain a weak reference to self for the duration of _engine_type. Then, after obtaining the result from _engine_type, we ensure that the period is still alive by checking if period() is not None. If the weakly referenced PeriodIndex object has been dropped prematurely, a RuntimeError is raised. This ensures that the PeriodEngine always receives a valid PeriodIndex.
