The buggy function `_engine` seems to have an issue with creating a weak reference to the `self` object. This is causing a problem when the `self` object is later used in `self._engine_type`.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect creation of the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`. This returns a weak reference object, but the object reference is not being retained. The weak reference should be maintained by assigning it to a variable.

To fix the bug, we need to assign the weak reference to a variable, then use that variable to create the weak reference. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By assigning the weak reference to the `period` variable, we can then pass this variable to `_engine_type` to avoid the reference cycle issue.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
