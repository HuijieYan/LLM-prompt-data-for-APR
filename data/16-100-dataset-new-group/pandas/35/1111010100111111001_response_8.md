The bug seems to be related to the _engine_type method and the weakref usage. Upon analyzing the code and error message, it seems that the _engine_type method is returning a 'NoneType' object due to the weak reference to self.

To fix this bug, you can directly pass 'self' to the _engine_type method instead of using weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
