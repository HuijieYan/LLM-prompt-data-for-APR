The buggy function `_engine` has a problem with creating a weak reference to `self`. It then uses this weak reference to call `_engine_type` with `period` and the length of `self`.

The potential error lies in creating the weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`. This might lead to the weak reference being garbage collected before being used in `_engine_type`.

The cause of the bug is that when a weak reference is created, it doesn't increase the reference count of the object it's referencing. So if the weak reference is the only reference to the object, the object may be garbage collected before we actually use it.

To fix the bug, we should create a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference, and then use the strong reference in `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the `self` object is not garbage collected before being used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self before creating the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    strong_self = period()

    # Use the strong reference in _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(strong_self, len(self))
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly use a strong reference to `self` and should pass the failing test.
