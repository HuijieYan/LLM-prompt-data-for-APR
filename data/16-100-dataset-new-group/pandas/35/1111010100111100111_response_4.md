The issue is related to copying a PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, which results in the loss of weakrefs, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

The buggy function `_engine` is using a weakref to create a reference to the object, but the weakref is not being handled properly and is resulting in a NoneType object error.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the weakref properly and ensure that the reference to the PeriodIndex object is maintained.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py
import weakref

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as before)
    
    Examples
    --------
    ... (same as before)
    """

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference proxy to self
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a weak reference proxy to the PeriodIndex object `self`, which maintains the reference to `self` without the risk of it being discarded prematurely. This should resolve the issue with the weakrefs being lost and prevent the NoneType object error.
