To fix the bug, we need to update the _engine function in the PeriodIndex class. The error message shows that the PeriodEngine is receiving a NoneType object instead of the intended PeriodIndex. This is happening because the weak reference to self is being dropped unexpectedly.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

In this corrected version, we are ensuring that the weak reference to self is maintained throughout the function. This should resolve the issue where the PeriodEngine was receiving a NoneType instead of the PeriodIndex.

With this fix, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass, and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
