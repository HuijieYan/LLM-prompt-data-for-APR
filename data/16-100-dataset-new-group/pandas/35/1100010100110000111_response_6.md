## Analyzing the buggy function and Error Message

The buggy function `_engine` is using `@cache_readonly` decorator, but it seems to have an issue when the `self._engine_type` is called. This is causing an AttributeError in the test related to `is_monotonic` for `idx2.levels`.

The GitHub issue indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weakrefs, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This seems to be the cause of the bug.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The issue is most likely related to the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` and how it's being used in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

## Explanation of the bug

The bug is caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the AttributeError when `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` is called.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) is maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying how the weak reference is used in the `_engine` function.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
# This is the corrected version of the `_engine` function
def _engine(self):
    # Use the weak reference properly by retrieving the strong reference when needed
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_weakref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By modifying the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function, we can ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely and can be accessed by the `PeriodEngine` without issues. This should resolve the bug and make the test pass.
