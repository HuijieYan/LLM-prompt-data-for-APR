The buggy function in the `PeriodIndex` class has a `cache_readonly` decorator, which should memoize the result of the function to improve performance. However, there is a bug in the implementation where `period` is being passed as a weak reference to `_engine_type`, but `len(self)` is being passed as the second argument. This can cause an issue as `self` may get garbage-collected by the time `_engine_type` is called.

To fix this bug:
1. Instead of passing `len(self)` as the second argument, it would be better to pass `period` as the second argument to `_engine_type`.
2. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the weak reference `period` is being accessed correctly when used in `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, period)
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `self` object is correctly passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` class works as expected without causing a reference cycle or potential garbage collection issues.

This correction should address the bug and ensure that the failing test (`test_get_level_values_when_periods`) passes without any issues.
