To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed. In the current implementation, the weak reference `period` is created inside the `_engine` function, but it is not used properly to maintain the reference to the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), ref=period)
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is passed to the `_engine_type` function as an additional argument `ref`. This ensures that the reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine_type` function, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test, and the expected output from the GitHub issue should be achieved.
