### Analysis
The issue seems to be related to the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential error locations
The potential error may be at the `@cache_readonly` decorator when caching the `_engine` function. It seems that the weak reference to the `self` object may not be maintained properly.

### Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained correctly so that it is not dropped prematurely.

### Bug fix
Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
from pandas.core.indexes.period import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to maintain the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` without causing it to be dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
