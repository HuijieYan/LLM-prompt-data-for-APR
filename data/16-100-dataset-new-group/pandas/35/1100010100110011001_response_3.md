The buggy function `_engine` appears to be trying to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`. However, it seems that the weak reference is not being correctly used, resulting in the error message "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'".

The cause of the bug is likely the incorrect usage of weak references. Weak references are used to avoid creating reference cycles that prevent objects from being garbage collected, but in this case, it seems that the weak reference is not carrying the intended object.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be properly created to point to `self`, and then it should be dereferenced when passed to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By properly dereferencing the weak reference with `()` when passed to `_engine_type`, the bug should be fixed and the function should return the intended output.
