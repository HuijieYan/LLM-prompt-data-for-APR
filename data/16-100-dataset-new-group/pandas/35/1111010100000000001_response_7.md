## Analysis
The `_engine` function is a property of the `PeriodIndex` class and is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator from the `pandas.util._decorators` module. The `weakref` module is also being used to avoid a reference cycle.

## Identified bug
The bug in this function is that the `weakref.ref(self)` should be stored as a local variable to maintain the weak reference, but it is not assigned to any variable. This may cause unexpected behavior due to the weak reference not being properly maintained.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not being stored properly, which may lead to unexpected behavior or memory leaks.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference to `self` in a local variable and pass that variable to `_engine_type` to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained.

## Corrected version
```python
    # corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store a weak reference to self in a local variable
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
