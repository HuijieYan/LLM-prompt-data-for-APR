The issue with the buggy function `_engine` is that it is using weakref.ref incorrectly. The weakref.ref creates a weak reference to the original object, but it does not access the original object automatically. Instead, it returns a weak reference object, and to access the original object, you need to call the weak reference object.

Additionally, the input parameters for the function are not being used within the function, so it seems like the function should be defined as a class method rather than an instance method.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly use the weak reference and also make sure it is using the input parameters properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

class PeriodIndex:
    # other methods...

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(cls):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(cls)
        return cls._engine_type(period, len(cls._values))
```

By making the `_engine` function a class method and using `cls` instead of `self` for the weak reference, we can ensure that the weak reference is being used correctly. Additionally, we are using `cls._values` to access the values of the PeriodIndex within the function. This should fix the issue and make the function operate as expected.
