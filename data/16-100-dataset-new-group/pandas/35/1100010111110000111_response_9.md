### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using weak references, but it seems there is an issue with how it is being used, causing the `NoneType` error. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then check if the levels are monotonic, but it's failing with an `AttributeError` related to `NoneType`.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by a premature droppage of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` in the `_engine` function, leading to `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`. This results in the `NoneType` error when trying to access an attribute of the `None` object.

### Fix Strategy
The fix strategy involves ensuring that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained properly so that it is not prematurely dropped. This will prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), ref=True)
```

In the corrected version, an additional argument `ref=True` is added to the `_engine_type` function call to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and not dropped prematurely.

This correction should resolve the `NoneType` error and ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not lost before it's intended.
