## Potential Error Locations
The potential error is likely in the `_engine` function, specifically in the way it is creating the weak reference to the `self` object.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the weak reference to the `self` object not being created correctly within the `_engine` function. This results in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is created properly, so that the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by using the `weakref.proxy` method to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
