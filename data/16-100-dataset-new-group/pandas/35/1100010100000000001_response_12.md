The buggy function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which means it should return a cached value unless the cache is invalidated. The potential error in this function is that it's not handling the weak reference properly, which could lead to a reference cycle or memory leak.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly. It should be used to create a weak reference to `self`, but instead, it is trying to pass `period` directly to `self._engine_type` which may cause a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, we should use the weak reference `period` to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass that weak reference to `self._engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are calling the weak reference `period` as a function `period()` to obtain the original reference to `self` when passing it to `self._engine_type`. This ensures that a weak reference is passed instead of a strong reference, avoiding a potential reference cycle.
