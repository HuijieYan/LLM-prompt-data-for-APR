The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` but then passing `len(self)` as an argument to the `_engine_type` function. This can cause issues because the weak reference may not be valid at the time the `_engine_type` function is called.

To fix this bug, we can simply pass `self` to the `_engine_type` function instead of creating a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test.
