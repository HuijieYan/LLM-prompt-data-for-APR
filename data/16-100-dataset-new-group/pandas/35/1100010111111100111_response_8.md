## Correction of the buggy function

After analyzing the buggy function, the failing test, the error message, runtime input/output values, and the GitHub issue, it's clear that the issue arises from the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference of `self` is not being properly utilized within the `_engine` function, leading to the `NoneType` error when trying to access the attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is appropriately used to avoid dropping the `PeriodIndex` prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weak reference to avoid prematurely dropping the reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

In the corrected version, the `weakref.ref(self)` is properly used to create a weak reference to `self`, allowing the `PeriodIndex` to be retained long enough for the `PeriodEngine` to access it without encountering the `NoneType` error.

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass successfully, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
