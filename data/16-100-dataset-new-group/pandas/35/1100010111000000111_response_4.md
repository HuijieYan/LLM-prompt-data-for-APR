The potential error in the buggy function is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it is intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to store the weak reference to the PeriodIndex using weakref.proxy() instead of weakref.ref(). This will ensure that the reference is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub related to weak reference dropping prematurely.
