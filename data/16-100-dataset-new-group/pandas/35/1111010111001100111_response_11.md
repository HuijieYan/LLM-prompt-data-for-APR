The buggy function `_engine` is defined within the `PeriodIndex` class and is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` as an argument to `_engine_type`. The issue appears to be related to the weak reference being dropped before its intended use, resulting in the `_engine` function returning a `None` instead of the expected instance of `_engine_type`.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the weak reference of `self` is maintained until its use within `_engine_type`. One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference by maintaining it until the intended use. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, ensuring it persists for as long as needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference of `self` is stored as the `_period_ref` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, ensuring its persistence throughout the function's execution.

With this correction, the issue described in the GitHub report should be resolved, and the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass.
