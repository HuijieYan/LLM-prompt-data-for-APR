This buggy function is part of the Pandas library and is used in the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is designed to return the `_engine_type` attribute using a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object to avoid a reference cycle.

The error message indicates that the `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the `_engine_type` is not being assigned correctly.

The GitHub issue confirms that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the `_engine` function.

A corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(period), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self` is maintained throughout the function by using `weakref.proxy()` when passing it to the `_engine_type`.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct `_engine_type`.
