The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error. The function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but it seems like `_engine_type` is not returning a valid object, resulting in a `NoneType` object that does not have a `view` attribute. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_engine_type` returns a valid object, and possibly handle the case where it returns `None`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Engine type returned None")
```

In this corrected version, we check if the `engine` returned by `_engine_type` is not None. If it is not, we return the engine; otherwise, we raise a `ValueError` indicating that the engine type returned `None`. This will prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
