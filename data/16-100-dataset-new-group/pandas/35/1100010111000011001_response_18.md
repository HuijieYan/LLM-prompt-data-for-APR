### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of self. The issue may be with how the weak reference is being used.

### Potential Error
The potential error lies in the usage of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This may not be the correct way to handle weak referencing.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. This is leading to an unexpected behavior when passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
Instead of creating a weak reference to the `self` object, the correct approach might be to directly pass the `self` object to `_engine_type` while ensuring that weak referencing is appropriately handled within the `_engine_type` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
