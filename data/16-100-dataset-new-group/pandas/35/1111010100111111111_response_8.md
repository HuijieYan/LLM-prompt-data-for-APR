The buggy function `_engine` appears to be a caching mechanism to create and return an instance of `Engine`.

The cause of the bug is that when `PeriodIndex` is passed to `_engine_type`, it uses `weakref.ref(self)` which results in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended. As a result, the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the weak reference and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
