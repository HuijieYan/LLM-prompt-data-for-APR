The cause of the bug is that the _engine function is using weakref.ref() incorrectly, which is causing issues in the test_get_level_values_when_periods test. The weakref.ref() should be used to create a weak reference to the self variable, not to create a reference to the PeriodArray object.

To fix the bug, we need to pass the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object itself as an argument to the _engine_type function instead of just passing the period. This will avoid the reference cycle issue and resolve the bug.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_index_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_index_ref, len(self))
```

With this change, the _engine function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
