Based on the error message and the runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function, the cause of the bug is likely related to the `_engine_type` function returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns the correct type of object instead of `None`. This can be achieved by checking the implementation of the `_engine_type` function and making necessary modifications to return the appropriate object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        # handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```

By checking the output of `_engine_type` and ensuring it does not return `None`, we can prevent the AttributeError from occurring and fix the bug.
