## Fixing the bug

The bug seems to be related to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it's intended to. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it's no longer needed.

Let's correct the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
Updated function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    weakref.finalize(self, engine.close)
    return engine
```

Now that we've updated the function, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` will be maintained until it's no longer needed, and the issue described in the Github post should be resolved.
