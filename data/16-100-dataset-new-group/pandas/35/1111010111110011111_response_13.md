The issue lies in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, where the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is being lost. This loss of reference results in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the attribute 'view' in the failing test.

To fix this, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` persists, and the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference.

## A corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By preserving the weak reference to `self`, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected reference and does not encounter the 'NoneType' error from a lost reference.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
