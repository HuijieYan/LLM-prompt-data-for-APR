## The bug
The `_engine` function is trying to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self` in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. However, the weak reference is not being utilized correctly, which can lead to reference cycle issues.

## Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to use the weak reference `period` when creating the `_engine_type` object to avoid creating a reference cycle.

## The corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
