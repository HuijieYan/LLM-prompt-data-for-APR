In the given buggy function, `_engine`, the `weakref.ref()` function is used to attach a weak reference to the `self` parameter, but this weak reference may become `None` before the function returns. This issue is causing an error in the test related to `is_monotonic`.

To fix this issue, you can update the `_engine` method to return a weak reference to the actual object using the `weakref.ref()` function. Then, whenever accessing the weak reference, you can use the `weakref.proxy()` function, which will do the reference management automatically.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return weakref.proxy(self._engine_type(period, len(self)))
```

With this fix, the weak reference will correctly point to the actual object, and the error encountered in the failing test should be resolved.
