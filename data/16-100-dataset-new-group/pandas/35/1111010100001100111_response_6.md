## Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex`. This weak reference is used to avoid a reference cycle. However, the problem arises when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug cause
The `weakref.ref` is not being used correctly in the `_engine` function, leading to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object being dropped prematurely.

## Fix strategy
Modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle weak references by using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`. This will ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until it is no longer needed.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, **kwargs):
        ...
        if data is None and freq is not None:
            ...
            self._engine = self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the above corrected version, the `_engine` function is modified to use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, ensuring that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed.
