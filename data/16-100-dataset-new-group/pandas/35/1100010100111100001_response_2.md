The buggy function `_engine` is using the `weakref` module to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the error message and the runtime values indicate that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` returning a `NoneType` object and not having the attribute `view`.

This indicates that the `_engine_type` method is not returning the expected object. The `weakref.ref` approach might not be suitable for creating a weak reference in this context.

To fix this bug, we can directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` method without using `weakref.ref`. This ensures that the reference to `self` does not create a strong reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` method, we avoid any potential issues related to weak referencing and ensure that the `_engine` function returns the expected object. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
