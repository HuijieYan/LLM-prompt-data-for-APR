The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the fact that `self._engine_type` is expecting a weak reference object, but it is being passed a normal reference object instead. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute of the weak reference.

To fix this bug, we need to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` instead of a normal reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will properly pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, avoiding the reference cycle and preventing the `AttributeError` from occurring.
