Based on the information provided, the bug is likely caused by the weak reference not being properly maintained in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. When the weak reference is dropped before intended, the `PeriodEngine` receives a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should properly maintain the weak reference to avoid it being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to obtain the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

This correction should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass, ensuring that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is properly maintained.
