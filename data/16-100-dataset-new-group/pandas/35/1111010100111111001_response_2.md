The bug here is that the `_engine_type` is called with a weak reference to `self` and the length of the period index, but the `_engine` function returns an instance of `_engine_type` without calling it as intended. This leads to a `NoneType` error as the instance is not properly created.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to actually instantiate the `_engine_type` with the weak reference to `self` and the length of the period index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
With this correction, the `self._engine` will properly return an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with the correct parameters. This should fix the `NoneType` error and make the failing test pass.
