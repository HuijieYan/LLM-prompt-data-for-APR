The issue with the `_engine` function is that it uses `cache_readonly`, which is not imported and provided in the environment. As a result, it causes the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail.

To fix the bug:
1. Import `cache_readonly` from the appropriate module.
2. Remove the `cache_readonly` decorator from the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
from pandas.util._decorators import cache_readonly

# ... (other imports and class declarations)

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other class methods and attributes)

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
