To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and utilized. The bug appears to be related to the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it is intended to, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

We can fix this bug by modifying the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference using the `weakref` module and ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Utilize the weak reference to get the PeriodIndex
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the weak reference to `self` is properly converted to a callable using `period()`, so the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected `PeriodIndex`.
This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and make the failing test pass.
