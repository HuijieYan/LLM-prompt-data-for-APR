### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, using `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference to the object and returns a weak reference object, not the original object itself. Therefore, returning just the weak reference object will not work as expected.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the function should return the original object and not the weak reference object. The weak reference should be used inside the `_engine_type` function if needed.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
