The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before it is intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely before it is used by the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that the weakly referenced `self` is retained until it's actually used by the `PeriodEngine`, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
