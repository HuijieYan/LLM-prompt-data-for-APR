To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to address the issue of weak references being dropped before intended. We can modify the implementation of `_engine` to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is retained until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Store the weakref in a property of the engine to ensure it is not dropped prematurely
    engine._period_ref = period
    
    return engine
```

In this corrected version, we store the `weakref` of the `PeriodIndex` object in a property of the `engine` object. This ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is retained until the engine object is no longer needed.

This should resolve the issue raised in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values. Additionally, it addresses the GitHub issue ("BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs") by ensuring that weak references are not dropped prematurely.
