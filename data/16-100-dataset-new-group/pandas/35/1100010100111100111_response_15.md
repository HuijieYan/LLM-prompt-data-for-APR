Based on the error message and the runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function, it seems that the issue is with the weak reference `period` being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses this issue:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

By creating a variable `engine` to store the result of `_engine_type` and returning `engine` instead of the result of `_engine_type` directly, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used by `engine` and no longer needed.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
