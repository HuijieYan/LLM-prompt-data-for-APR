## Analysis
The buggy function is `_engine(self)` defined within the `PeriodIndex` class. It is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, indicating that its return value should be cached and not re-evaluated on subsequent calls. The function uses a weak reference to the `self` object to avoid a reference cycle and initialize the `_engine_type`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` aims to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checks for monotonicity. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` during the monotonicity check.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem and the expected output for the failing test.

## Identification of potential error locations
The error could be occurring due to the weak reference to `self` being dropped prematurely, causing the `_engine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is the premature dropping of the weak reference to `self`, as described in the GitHub issue. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, resulting in the `AttributeError` when trying to access the view of a non-existent object.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `_engine_type`. This can potentially be achieved by modifying the way the weak reference is created or utilized within the `_engine` function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Explicitly create a weak reference to self and hold it until necessary
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class PeriodIndexEngine(PeriodEngine):
        def _do_monotonic_check(self):
            period_ref = period_weakref()
            if period_ref is not None:
                values = period_ref._get_index_values()
                return values.view('i8')
            return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")

    return PeriodIndexEngine(period_weakref, len(self))
```
