The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when running the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` due to a bug related to the `period` variable. The function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance, but it's not handled properly and might be causing the issue.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to make sure that the `period` is not a weak reference but instead retrieves the underlying object through `weakref.proxy` when accessing properties or methods of the object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to avoid creating a weak reference and retrieve the underlying object
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that `period` acts as a reference to the original object and doesn't create a weak reference. This should resolve the `AttributeError` issue.

With this correction, the `_engine` function should now operate correctly and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values.
