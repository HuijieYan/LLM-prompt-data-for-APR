The issue with the buggy function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) and passing it to `_engine_type`, but the weak reference is not being maintained. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used by `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def get_engine(period_ref, length):
        return self._engine_type(period_ref(), length)
    
    return get_engine(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we create a `period_ref` as a weak reference to `self`, and then define an inner function `get_engine` that takes the weak reference and length as parameters and returns the result of calling `self._engine_type` with the weak reference and length. This ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used by `_engine_type`, resolving the bug.

This should address the GitHub issue and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes as expected.
