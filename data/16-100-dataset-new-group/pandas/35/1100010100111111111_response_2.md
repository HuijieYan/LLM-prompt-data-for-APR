The bug in the provided function is causing the error "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'" in the failing test. The function is supposed to return the engine type for the PeriodIndex, but there is an issue with weak referencing, leading to a NoneType object being returned instead.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex is handled correctly so that the engine type is returned as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By creating a new variable `period_weakref` and passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak referencing of `self` is done correctly. This should resolve the issue with weak referencing and prevent the NoneType object from being returned.

The corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
