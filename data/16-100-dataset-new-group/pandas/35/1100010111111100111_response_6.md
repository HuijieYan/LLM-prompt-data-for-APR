To fix the bug, we can update the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not lost prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to store the weak reference to `Period` within the function and then passing it to `_engine_type` as needed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store weak reference to self within the function
    self._engine_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Pass the weakref of self to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(self._engine_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference within the function and then passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is needed by `_engine_type`. This resolves the issue of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue.
