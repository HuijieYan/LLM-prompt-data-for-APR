The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is trying to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type` to create the engine. However, it seems that the `_engine_type` method is not designed to take a weak reference as an argument, and instead it is expecting a regular reference to `self`.

To fix the bug, we should pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` rather than creating a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
