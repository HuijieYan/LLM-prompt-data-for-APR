The buggy function is the `_engine` method in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute, and it points to the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`.

The potential error in the buggy function is that it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which might be returning a `None` type object, leading to the AttributeError.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` method is not returning a valid engine object, and the subsequent attempts to access a method or attribute of this object are failing.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should be modified to ensure that it is returning a valid engine object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
```

In the corrected version, after creating the engine object, we check if it's not None. If it's not None, we return the engine object. If it's None, we raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.

This fix ensures that a valid engine object is returned from the `_engine` method, addressing the AttributeError issue.
