The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `self._engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The use of weak references is to avoid creating reference cycles, but it seems that there might be an issue with how the weak reference `period` is being used in `_engine_type`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` `idx` from a `PeriodIndex` and then creates another `MultiIndex` `idx2` by calling `idx._get_level_values(level)` for each level in `idx`. The test then checks if all the levels in `idx2` are monotonic.

The issue with the buggy function is that it's not correctly using the weak reference `period` when passing it to `_engine_type`. It's possible that `_engine_type` is expecting something other than a weak reference.

To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type` to ensure that the correct reference to `self` is being used.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is dereferenced using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should ensure that the correct reference to `self` is being used and fix the bug.
