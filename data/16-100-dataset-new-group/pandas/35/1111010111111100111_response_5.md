Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug in the `_engine` function is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This results in an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Store the weak reference to self in a local variable that stays in scope
    self._period_weakref = period
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in a local variable (`self._period_weakref`), we ensure that it remains in scope until it is no longer needed. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
