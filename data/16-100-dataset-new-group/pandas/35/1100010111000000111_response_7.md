The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the weakref not being properly passed to `_engine_type`, leading to a None value being received instead of the intended PeriodIndex. This causes the failing test to raise an error when checking if all level values are monotonic.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.proxy()` and then passing this weak reference to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass as expected.
