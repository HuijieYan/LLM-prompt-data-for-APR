## Analysis
The function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex` in this case. The weak reference is then passed to `self._engine_type` to create an instance of the engine. The issue seems to be with the weak reference not being maintained properly, leading to `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

## Bug
The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained properly throughout the function and is not dropped prematurely.

## Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_instance

```

With this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained until the `engine_instance` is returned, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the proper `PeriodIndex`. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
