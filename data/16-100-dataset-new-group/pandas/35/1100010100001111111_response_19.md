## Fixing the bug

The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference handling. The weak reference to `self` is not being properly passed to `_engine_type`, leading to a None value being passed instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. To fix this, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and utilized within the `_engine` function.

## The corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))

```
