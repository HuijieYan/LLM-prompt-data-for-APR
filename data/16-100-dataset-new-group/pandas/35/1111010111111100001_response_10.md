The bug is in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. It's trying to access `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which suggests that the `_engine_type` attribute is either not defined or is set to `None`. This is causing the AttributeError when trying to access `.view("i8")`, as it's trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` attribute is properly initialized. This could involve setting it to a valid value or ensuring that it's initialized before being accessed in the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Ensure that _engine_type is properly initialized
    if self._engine_type is None:
        # Replace `YourEngineType` with the actual type you want to use
        self._engine_type = YourEngineType
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
