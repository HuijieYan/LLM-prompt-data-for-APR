The potential error in the buggy function is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By making the modification to `period()` in the return statement, we ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` function, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
