Based on the GitHub issue and the runtime input/output values, it is evident that the issue is related to the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the execution of the _engine function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In the corrected version, `len(self._values)` is used instead of `len(self)` to ensure that the length of the values is correctly passed to the _engine_type function. This should maintain the weak reference to the PeriodIndex and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
