## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By changing `period` to `period()`, we are now passing the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` correctly, resolving the issue of the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

With this change, the corrected function should now return the expected output and resolve the GitHub issue.
