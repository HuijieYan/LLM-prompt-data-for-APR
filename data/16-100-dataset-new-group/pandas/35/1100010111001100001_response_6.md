The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the weak reference is not being utilized properly, and there is a potential reference cycle that needs to be avoided.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being properly utilized, which may lead to memory leaks and other issues.

To fix the bug, the function should properly utilize the weak reference to `self` and avoid any potential reference cycles.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By properly utilizing the weak reference and calling it with `period()`, we can ensure that the reference is used correctly and any potential reference cycles are avoided.
