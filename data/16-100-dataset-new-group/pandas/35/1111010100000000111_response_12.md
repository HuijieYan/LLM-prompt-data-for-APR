Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` er (presumably "ref") is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `_engine` function where the weak reference to `self` is being created and passed to `_engine_type`.

Cause of the bug:
The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This is likely due to the weak reference not being maintained for the lifetime of the `PeriodEngine`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` needs to be maintained for the lifetime of the `PeriodEngine` to ensure that it does not get dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodEngine` instance so that it remains in scope for as long as the `PeriodEngine` is needed.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Create a PeriodEngine instance with the weak reference stored as an attribute
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine._period_ref = period  # store the weak reference as an attribute of the engine
    return engine
```
