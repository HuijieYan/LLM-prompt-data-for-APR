The buggy function `_engine` returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which causes the error, `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, in the failing test. This suggests that the `_engine_type` method returns `None` instead of an engine object.

To fix the bug, you should check the implementation of the `_engine_type` method, which should create and return an engine object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create the engine object")
    return engine
```

By adding the check for the `None` return value from `_engine_type`, you can ensure that the `engine` object is always properly created and returned. This change should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
