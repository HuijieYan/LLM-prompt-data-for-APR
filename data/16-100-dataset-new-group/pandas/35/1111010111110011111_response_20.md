Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function uses weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it appears that the weak reference is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained throughout the usage of the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

We've modified the code based on the understanding of the issue and attempted to maintain the intended behavior of the weak reference. This should resolve the problem and make the failing test pass.
