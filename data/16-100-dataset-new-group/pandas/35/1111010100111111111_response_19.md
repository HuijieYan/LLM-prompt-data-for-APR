The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when accessing the `is_monotonic` property of the index. The bug stems from the weak reference implementation, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function needs to be adjusted to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is appropriately referenced.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a strong reference to self
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By using a strong reference to `self` instead of a weak reference, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the intended `PeriodIndex` object and thus resolves the `AttributeError` issue.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
