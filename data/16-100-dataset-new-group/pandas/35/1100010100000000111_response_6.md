## Analysis
The `_engine` function is intended to return the engine type for the PeriodIndex. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when copying the PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, weakrefs are lost, resulting in an error.

## Potential Error Locations
The use of `weakref.ref(self)` could be causing the weak reference to be dropped prematurely, leading to the issue reported on GitHub.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is intended to be dropped. This could involve adjusting the usage of weakref or ensuring that the weak reference is not prematurely dropped.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is intended to be dropped
    period = weakref.ref(self, lambda x: None)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
