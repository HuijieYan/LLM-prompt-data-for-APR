The buggy function `_engine` is causing an AttributeError in the `is_monotonic` attribute in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` due to the weak reference PeriodIndex being dropped before its intended use. 

To fix this bug, the weak reference PeriodIndex must be maintained until it's no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to store a weak reference to `self` and use it to create the `_engine_type` for proper handling of weak references.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing `weakref.ref(self)` in a variable `weak_period` and passing that to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until its intended use.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
