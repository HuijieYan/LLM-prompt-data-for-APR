The buggy function `_engine` is designed to return an instance of `self._engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`. The error message indicates that the return value is `None`, which suggests that `self._engine_type` is not being properly initialized.

One potential cause of this bug is the incorrect use of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object, and to access the original object, the `()`, e.g. `period()`, should be called on the weak reference object.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_engine` function to properly create and access the weak reference to `self` before passing it to `self._engine_type` for initialization.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By calling `weakref.ref(self)()` instead of just `weakref.ref(self)`, the weak reference is properly accessed and passed to `self._engine_type` for initialization. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `_engine` function returns the expected value, passing the failing test.
