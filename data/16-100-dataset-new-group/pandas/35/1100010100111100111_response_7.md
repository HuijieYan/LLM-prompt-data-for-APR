The issue seems to be with the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before it should. This is causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex, resulting in an AttributeError when attempting to access the 'view' attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def get_engine(period):
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return get_engine(period_ref)
```

This will ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, allowing the PeriodEngine to receive the correct reference and resolve the AttributeError issue.
