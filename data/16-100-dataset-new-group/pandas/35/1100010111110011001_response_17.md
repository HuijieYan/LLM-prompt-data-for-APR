The current buggy function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator which suggests that it is supposed to be a cached value. However, it seems like `_engine` is trying to use weak reference to avoid cyclic references, but the current implementation is not handling it properly, leading to the AttributeError mentioned in the failing test.

The issue is likely with how the `weakref` is being used in the `_engine` function. It seems that the `weakref` object `period` is not being properly used when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This is causing the `NoneType` error when trying to access the view.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the weak reference `period` is being used properly when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. Additionally, it might be necessary to handle cases where `period` becomes a weak reference proxy and cannot be used directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are calling `period()` to retrieve the actual reference object from the weak reference, which should resolve the issue with weak reference handling.
