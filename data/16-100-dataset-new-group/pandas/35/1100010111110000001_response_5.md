The buggy function is the `_engine` function in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is an AttributeError in the `PeriodEngine` related to the `view` attribute.

The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the way the weak reference `period` is being passed to `_engine_type`.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` might not be properly converted back to the original reference, leading to a `NoneType` object error when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, the correct strategy would be to make sure that the weak reference `period` is properly converted back to the original reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
With this correction, the weak reference `period` is properly converted back to the original reference using `weakref.proxy` before passing it to `_engine_type`.
