#### 1. Analysis
The buggy function seems to be a cached property `_engine` of the `PeriodIndex` class which returns an instance of the `PeriodEngine`. The error is related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

#### 2. Potential error locations
The error seems to be originating from the `_engine_type` method where the `period` variable is created using `weakref.ref(self)`.

#### 3. Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the `weakref.ref(self)` call, which doesn't hold a strong reference to the `self` object and might be returning `None` in some cases, leading to the error when `view` is called on it.

#### 4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` does not return `None`, and instead returns a proper reference to the object.

#### 5. Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self to ensure it's not garbage collected
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
