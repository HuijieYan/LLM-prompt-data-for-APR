## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, test code
The buggy function is a cache read-only function named `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` and uses `weakref` to avoid a reference cycle.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` and then attempts to get the level values from it.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the buggy function is the use of `weakref` to create a reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`. The issue could be related to the management of weak references, which can lead to the engine not being properly initialized.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the failing test
The bug can cause the `_engine_type` instance to not be initialized correctly due to the use of weak references, leading to unexpected behavior when using the `PeriodIndex`.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
A possible strategy for fixing the bug is to directly create the `_engine_type` instance without using weak references or cache the result of the `_engine_type` initialization to ensure it is properly initialized.

## Provide a corrected version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))

# Add the cached version of _engine
@cache_readonly
def engine(self):
    return self._engine
```
In the corrected version, the `_engine` function creates an instance of `_engine_type` directly without using weak references. Additionally, a cached version of `engine` is added to ensure that the engine is properly initialized and stored for subsequent use.
