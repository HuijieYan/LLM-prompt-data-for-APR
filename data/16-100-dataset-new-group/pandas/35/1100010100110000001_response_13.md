The bug in the provided function `_engine` is likely due to the use of `weakref.ref`, which causes an AttributeError when trying to access the `_engine` attribute.

To fix this bug, we can use a strategy that involves creating a strong reference to the object and then using it for the specific method call.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we're directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` method instead of using a weak reference, which should resolve the AttributeError issue.
