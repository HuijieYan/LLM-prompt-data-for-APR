To fix the bug, we need to modify the _engine function to correctly use weakref to avoid the reference cycle. We can modify the code as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, self._engine_len())
```

By making this change, we ensure that the weakref of self is correctly passed to _engine_type, preventing the reference cycle and resolving the issue with weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended.

With this correction, the expected output of the failing test case should now return True, as the bug has been fixed.
