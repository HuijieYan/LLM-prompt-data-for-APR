The bug in the `_engine` function is likely related to the use of weak references and the `_engine_type` method. When using weak references, there is a possibility that the weak reference object may have been garbage-collected, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to access the weakly referenced object. This can result in `self` being `None` when trying to create the `_engine` using the weakly referenced `period`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function needs to ensure that `self` is properly maintained and not garbage-collected before being used in the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        # Ensure that the weakly referenced self is reachable and not garbage-collected
        if period() is not None:
            return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("Weakly referenced self not available")
```
In the corrected version, we've added a conditional check to ensure that the weakly referenced `self` is still reachable using `period()`. If `self` is not available, a `RuntimeError` is raised, indicating that the weakly referenced `self` is no longer available, thus avoiding unexpected behavior due to garbage collection.
