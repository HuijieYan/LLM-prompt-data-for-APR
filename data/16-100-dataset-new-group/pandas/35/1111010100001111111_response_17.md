To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should include a weak reference to the `self` object to avoid circular references. The corrected version of the function is shown below.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is used to avoid a reference cycle, and the length of `self._values` is used instead of `len(self)` to ensure that the correct length is passed to `_engine_type`.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
