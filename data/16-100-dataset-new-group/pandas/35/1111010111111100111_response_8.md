The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` initialized with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` and its length. However, the issue arises when the weak reference is dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a NoneType instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The error message from the failing test provides more insight into the issue, indicating that the `PeriodEngine` is expecting a non-None object but receiving None instead.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` should be stored as a property of the `PeriodEngine` instance to prevent it from being prematurely dropped.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)

    class _Engine(PeriodEngine):
        def __init__(self, period, length):
            super().__init__(period, length)
            self._weakref_period = period

    return _Engine(weakref_period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference is stored as `_weakref_period` within the `_Engine` instance, ensuring that it is kept alive as long as the `_Engine` instance is in use. This prevents the premature dropping of the weak reference and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
