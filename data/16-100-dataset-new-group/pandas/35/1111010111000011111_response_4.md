The bug in the `PeriodIndex` class's `_engine` function seems to be related to weak referencing, which causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This results in the failing test case that expects `all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` to return `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained properly when passing it to the `PeriodEngine`, so that it does not get lost prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we call the `weakref` object as a function (`period()`), which returns the weakly referenced object, ensuring that it is not lost prematurely. This should resolve the weak referencing issue and make the failing test case pass as expected.
