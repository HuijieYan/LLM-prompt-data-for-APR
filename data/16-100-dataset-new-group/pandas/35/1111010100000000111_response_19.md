The bug in the function `_engine` is causing weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is leading to the error raised in the GitHub issue when trying to check if all levels of the MultiIndex are monotonic.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely. We can achieve this by modifying the function to use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    # this is the corrected version of the function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that the PeriodIndex is not prematurely dropped, resolving the weakref issue and fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
