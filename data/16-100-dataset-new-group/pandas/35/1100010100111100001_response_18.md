The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing an `AttributeError` because it is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `view` attribute.

The bug is likely caused by the `_engine_type` function not returning a valid object as expected, resulting in the `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid object of the expected type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```
