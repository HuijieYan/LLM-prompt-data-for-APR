The issue here is that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object is being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained for as long as it is needed by the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    # Maintain a reference to the weakref to prevent it from being dropped prematurely
    engine._period_ref = period
    return engine
```

In this corrected version, we are maintaining a reference to the weak reference `period` within the `engine` object to prevent it from being dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
