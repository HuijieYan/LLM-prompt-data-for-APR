#### Expected input
self: a Pandas PeriodIndex object

#### Expected output
A weak reference to the Pandas PeriodIndex object

### Expected case 2
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
self, len(self)

#### Expected input
self: a Pandas PeriodIndex object
len(self): an integer representing the length of the PeriodIndex object

#### Expected output
An instance of the _engine_type class initialized with a weak reference to the Pandas PeriodIndex object and the length of the PeriodIndex object

### Bug explanation
The bug in the function is that it is not using the weak reference object correctly. The weakref.ref() function is used to create a weak reference to the object, but it is not being used properly when passed to _engine_type. This can lead to a reference cycle issue, where the object cannot be garbage collected properly due to a circular reference.

### Fix strategy
The fix strategy involves properly using the weak reference object and ensuring that it is handled correctly within the _engine_type class to avoid any reference cycle issues.

### Corrected code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
