# The bug in the _engine function is the use of weakref.ref(self) instead of weakref.proxy(self) which creates a weak reference proxy to the original object.

# The bug is causing the _engine function to not correctly handle the weak reference, leading to unexpected behavior in the test function.

# The strategy for fixing the bug is to replace the use of weakref.ref(self) with weakref.proxy(self) in the _engine function.

# Corrected version of the _engine function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
