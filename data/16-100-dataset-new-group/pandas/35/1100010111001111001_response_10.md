The bug in the _engine function appears to be the use of weakref.ref(self). This creates a weak reference to the 'self' object, which may cause the reference to be lost before the function can use it. This can lead to unexpected behavior, and is likely the cause of the failing test.

To fix the bug, we can directly pass 'self' to the _engine_type function without creating a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing 'self' to the _engine_type function, we can avoid the potential issues caused by using weak references, and ensure that the function has access to the correct reference to 'self'.
