The issue seems to be related to the weak reference `period` being dropped before intended in the `_engine` function. This results in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing the failing test.

To fix this bug, we can ensure that the weak reference `period` remains valid until the `PeriodEngine` has finished using it.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    del period  # Ensuring weak reference remains valid until after _engine_type is called
    return result
```

With this fix, the weak reference `period` will remain valid until after the `PeriodEngine` has finished using it, resolving the issue and ensuring that the failing test passes.
