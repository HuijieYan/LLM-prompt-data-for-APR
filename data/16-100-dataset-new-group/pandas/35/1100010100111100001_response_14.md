The bug in the `_engine` function is likely related to the `_engine_type` method returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected result. This is causing an `AttributeError` when the function tries to access the `view` attribute of the `NoneType` object.

The function `_engine` creates a weak reference to `self` and passes it to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the issue seems to be that `_engine_type` is not returning an actual valid object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to handle the case where `_engine_type` returns a `NoneType` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_result is not None:
        return engine_result
    else:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
```

By adding a check for the `NoneType` result from `_engine_type` and raising a `ValueError` in that case, we can ensure that the function does not attempt to access attributes on a `NoneType` object.

With this modification, the function should handle the potential `NoneType` result and provide a meaningful error when it occurs.
