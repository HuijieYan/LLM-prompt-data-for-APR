Following the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the bug is likely caused by the use of a weak reference (`weakref.ref`) in the `_engine` function. Weak references are used to avoid reference cycles, but it seems that this implementation is causing the function to return an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the use of weak references should be re-evaluated. It might be necessary to simply return `self._engine_type(self, len(self))` without the use of a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This corrected version should resolve the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output for the failing test case.
