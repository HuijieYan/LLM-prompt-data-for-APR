The bug in the `_engine` function is likely to be related to the `weakref` usage and the instantiation of the `_engine_type` object. The use of `weakref` to avoid reference cycles is causing the `period` reference to be weak, so it might be getting garbage collected before being used by `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, we can remove the use of weak references and directly pass the `self` reference to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is kept alive during the instantiation of the `_engine_type` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This change should address the issue and allow the tests to pass as expected.
