The buggy function is the `_engine` function, which is a cached readonly function. The function is intended to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of the current `PeriodIndex` instance and its length as parameters.

The potential error in the function is the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. This could lead to a situation where the weak reference is not properly dereferenced, causing the reference cycle to persist.

The cause of the bug is the potential for a reference cycle to occur, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming memory. This could lead to memory leaks and inefficient memory usage.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. Using `weakref.proxy(self)` allows access to the members of `self` through the weak reference without explicitly calling the `dereference` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we have avoided creating a reference cycle and improved the memory management in the `PeriodIndex` class.
