Based on the provided code and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The issue stems from the use of weak references, which may result in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and utilized. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @property
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` to prevent the reference cycle issue.

With this fix, the `_engine` function should work as intended and resolve the issue reported on GitHub. The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case as well.
