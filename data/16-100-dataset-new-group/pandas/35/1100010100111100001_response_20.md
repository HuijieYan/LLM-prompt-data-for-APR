The bug is likely in the _engine_type method which is returning a NoneType object instead of the expected output, leading to the AttributeError when the code tries to access the 'view' attribute of the NoneType.

To fix the bug, the _engine_type method should be revised to ensure it returns the correct type of object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        return self._partial_class_for_type(LevelBase)
    return engine
```
