The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError when running the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. The function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, but the weak reference is being dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object should be maintained throughout the lifecycle of the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self throughout the lifecycle of the _engine function
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, a new attribute `_period_ref` is added to the `PeriodIndex` object to hold the weak reference to `self`. This ensures that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely, and the `PeriodEngine` will receive the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

With this correction, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully and the GitHub issue "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" should be resolved.
