The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing an AttributeError when the `is_monotonic` property is accessed in the failing test. The failing test provides input in the form of a `PeriodIndex` object, and the expected output is that all levels of the index should be monotonic.

It seems that the `_engine_type` method being called with the `self` reference is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to the AttributeError when the `is_monotonic` property is accessed. One strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid object, and check for potential issues with weak referencing that might be causing the problem.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type if engine_type is not None else self
```
By modifying the `_engine` function to return `self` if the `_engine_type` method returns `None`, we ensure that there is always a valid object returned, preventing the AttributeError in the failing test.
