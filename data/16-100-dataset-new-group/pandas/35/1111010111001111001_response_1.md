The bug in the `_engine` function appears to be in the use of `weakref.ref(self)`. When using `weakref.ref`, it returns a weak reference object which can't be accessed directly and therefore causes the bug. Instead, the `weakref.proxy` can be used to create a weak reference to the original PeriodIndex object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, the bug should be fixed and the function should work as expected.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
