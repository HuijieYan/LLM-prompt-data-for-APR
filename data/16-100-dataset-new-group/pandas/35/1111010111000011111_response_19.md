### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, so it is intended to cache the result of the function and return the cached value on subsequent calls. The function seems to be implementing a caching mechanism for the `_engine_type`, but there is a potential issue with weak referencing `self`.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error in the `_engine` function is the use of `weakref.ref(self)`. This could lead to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the weakly-referenced `PeriodIndex` object is not being properly retained, leading to a `None` reference being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is appropriately handled to retain the reference as intended.

### Bug Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a strong reference to self before creating the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._period_ref = period
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the fixed version, a strong reference to `self` is kept by assigning it to `self._period_ref` before creating the weak reference `period`. This ensures that the weak reference doesn't cause the `PeriodIndex` object to be dropped prematurely.

This fix should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
