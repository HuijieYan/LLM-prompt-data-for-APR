The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the `weakref` of `self` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This eventually leads to the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid for the duration it's used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Maintain a strong reference to self during the duration it's needed in _engine_type
        period = self
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The change made here is to keep a strong reference to `self` within the `_engine` function. This will prevent the `weakref` from being dropped while it's being used in the `_engine_type` method.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes without raising the AttributeError.
