The buggy function `_engine` appears to be trying to create a weak reference to `self` and then using that weak reference to create an instance of `self._engine_type`. However, the error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that the weak reference is not functioning as expected and is not returning the expected object.

The most likely cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being properly created, resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly create the weak reference using the `weakref.proxy` method, which returns a proxy to the object and allows attribute access to the original object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period_proxy = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_proxy, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weak reference to `self` will be properly created, and the proxy object will be passed to `_engine_type` instead of a `NoneType` object, resolving the `AttributeError` and fixing the bug.
