The buggy function `_engine` is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the attribute 'view' on a 'NoneType' object. This is likely due to the weak reference being dropped before it should.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is kept alive until it is no longer needed by the engine.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    ... (existing class documentation)
    """

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Keep a strong reference to the PeriodIndex until the engine no longer needs it
        period = self
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By keeping a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` until it's used by the engine, we prevent it from being prematurely garbage collected, resolving the attribute error.
