The buggy function `_engine` seems to be using a weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the bug is caused because the `period` weak reference is not being accessed properly when passed to `self._engine_type`.

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This can be done by calling `period()` to retrieve the original object from the weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
