### Analysis
The error message indicates that the function `PeriodEngine` is returning `NoneType` object instead of the expected value, causing an `AttributeError` in the subsequent code.

### Potential error location
The issue seems to be with the `_engine` function in the `period.py` file, which is being called to create the `PeriodEngine` object.

### Cause of the bug
The `PeriodEngine` returns a `NoneType` object instead of the expected value, possibly due to an issue with the weak reference to the `self` object passed to the `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained properly and that it is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` to create the `PeriodEngine` object.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference proxy to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which maintains a reference to the object without creating a strong reference cycle.

After making these changes, the function should return the expected `PeriodEngine` object without causing the `NoneType` error.
