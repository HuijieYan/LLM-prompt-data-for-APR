The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `self._engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The buggy code is attempting to avoid a reference cycle by using a weak reference, but the implementation seems incorrect, leading to the failing test.

The potential error is in the usage of `weakref.ref`. It should be used to create a weak reference to an object for using it to avoid reference cycles. However, in the provided code, it is being passed directly to `self._engine_type`, which seems incorrect.

The bug is causing the failing test because the `_engine` function is returning an incorrect result due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`, which results in the `idx2` object not being created properly. This causes the assertion `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` to fail.

To fix the bug, the usage of `weakref.ref` needs to be corrected. It should be used to create a weak reference to `self`, and then this weak reference should be used appropriately within the `_engine_type` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to return the object referenced by the weak reference, and it is passed to the `_engine_type` function along with the length of `self`. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
