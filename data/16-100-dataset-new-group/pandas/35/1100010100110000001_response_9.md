The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` related to a 'NoneType' object while trying to access the `view` attribute.

The bug is likely in the `_engine` function where the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid object and we need to handle the reference cycle using a weak reference properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, use a weakref callback to create and return the engine type
    def callback(ref):
        period = ref()
        if period is not None:
            return self._engine_type(period, len(period))
    return weakref.ref(self, callback)
```

By using the `callback` function and returning a weak reference to `self` while handling the reference cycle, we can fix the bug. This corrected version should address the AttributeError and enable the function to pass the failing test.
