The potential error in the buggy function is that it returns a weakly referenced PeriodIndex. This causes the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex, resulting in an error.

To fix the bug, we can change the _engine function to return a strong reference to self instead of a weak reference. This will ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now return a strong reference to the PeriodIndex, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass as expected.
