## The corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# This is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self) + 1)  # Fix by adding 1 to the length
```

By adding 1 to the length returned, it resolves the issue of receiving a `NoneType` object and ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely. This change should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the GitHub issue as well.
