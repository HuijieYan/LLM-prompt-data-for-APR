The issue seems to be related to weak references and the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. One potential error location within the buggy function is the use of weak references in the _engine function.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is getting dropped before it's intended, so the PeriodEngine is receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is evident from the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error message, which indicates that the PeriodEngine is receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we can try to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it's no longer needed by the PeriodEngine. One way to achieve this is to store the weak reference in a class attribute, which will prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function that should address the bug:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in a class attribute to prevent premature garbage collection
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```
By storing the weak reference in a class attribute, we can ensure that it remains valid for as long as the PeriodEngine needs it.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the failing test passes.
