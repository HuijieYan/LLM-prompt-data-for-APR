The bug is likely due to the `_engine_type` function not correctly handling the weak reference passed to it. This results in an AttributeError when the function tries to access the attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly dereferenced when passed to `_engine_type`. We can do this by using the `weakref.proxy` function, which returns a proxy to the original object that can be used as if it were the original object itself.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weak reference `period` will be properly handled by `_engine_type`, avoiding the AttributeError that was previously raised.
