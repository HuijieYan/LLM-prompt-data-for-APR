The buggy function `_engine` is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which implies that the function's output should be cached after its first execution. However, the error message indicates that the function is returning a `NoneType` object, which means that the caching mechanism is not working as expected.

The function receives `self` as an input parameter, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`. It then creates a weak reference to `self` and passes it to `self._engine_type()` along with the length of `self`. The error message indicates that the function is trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object, which suggests that the weak reference is not being properly handled or the `_engine_type` is returning `None` unexpectedly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is being used correctly and that the `_engine_type` is returning a valid object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type_result is not None:
        return engine_type_result
    else:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
```

By explicitly checking the result of `_engine_type` and handling the case where it returns `None`, we can ensure that the cached result is always a valid object.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
