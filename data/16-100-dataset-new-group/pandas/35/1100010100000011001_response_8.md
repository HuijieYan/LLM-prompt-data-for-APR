### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that it is intended to cache the value of the `_engine` function to avoid unnecessary calculations. The function is using weak references to avoid reference cycles and it returns the `_engine_type` with the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`.

### Bug
The bug in the function is that it is using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of creating a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. This is causing the weak reference to be called immediately, resulting in a weak reference object being passed instead of the actual reference.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type` as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
