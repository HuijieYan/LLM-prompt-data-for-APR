The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference of `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`. However, the error message indicates that the `_engine_type` attribute is returning a `NoneType` object, causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the implementation of the `_engine_type` attribute, which is not returning a valid object.

To fix the bug, we should check the implementation of the `_engine_type` attribute and ensure that it returns a valid object of the expected type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is not None:
        return engine_type
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
```

By adding a check for `None` and raising a `ValueError` if `_engine_type` returns `None`, we ensure that the function will not attempt to access attributes of a `NoneType` object. This should fix the bug.
