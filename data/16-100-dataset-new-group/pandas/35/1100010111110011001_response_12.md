### Analysis
The error message indicates an 'AttributeError' being raised due to a 'NoneType' object. This implies that the '_engine_type' function is returning 'None', leading to the error when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the '_engine' function, specifically in the return statement where 'self._engine_type(period, len(self))' is returning 'None' when it should be returning a valid object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect return value from the '_engine_type' function in the '_engine' method. This incorrect return value is leading to the 'NoneType' object, resulting in the 'AttributeError'.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Investigate the '_engine_type' function to understand its behavior and ensure that it returns the appropriate object type.
2. Validate the input parameters being passed to the '_engine_type' function.
3. Check for any conditions or logic inside the '_engine' function that could lead to 'None' being returned from the '_engine_type'.
4. Test the corrected version of the function to ensure that it no longer raises the 'AttributeError' and produces the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_result is not None:
        return engine_result
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid engine result from _engine_type")
