### Analysis
The buggy function seems to be using a decorator `@cache_readonly` which is intended to cache the return value of the function so that it is only calculated once. However, it seems that the caching mechanism is not working as expected, possibly due to the way the `weakref.ref` is being used.

### Bug
The bug in the function is likely causing the caching mechanism to not work properly, resulting in incorrect return values.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the caching issue, we can modify the way the weak reference is being used and ensure that it does not interfere with the caching mechanism.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected function, we replaced `weakref.ref` with `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self`. This should correctly cache the return value of the function and avoid the reference cycle issue.
