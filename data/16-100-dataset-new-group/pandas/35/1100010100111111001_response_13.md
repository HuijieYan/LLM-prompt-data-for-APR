To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly created and used. The error message indicates that a NoneType object is being accessed which suggests that the weak reference is not working as intended.

One way to fix this bug is to use the `weakref.proxy` function to create a weak reference to `self` and then access the `period` attribute to get the actual reference when needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference of self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy`, we ensure that a weak reference to `self` is created and used, which should prevent the reference cycle and the subsequent error when accessing the weak reference.

With this correction, the `_engine` function should now properly create and use a weak reference to `self` without causing any reference cycle or NoneType errors.
