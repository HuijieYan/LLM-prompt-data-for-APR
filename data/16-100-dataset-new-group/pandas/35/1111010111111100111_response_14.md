### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The issue arises when the `PeriodIndex` is used in a `MultiIndex` and then attempted to retrieve the level values, leading to a `NoneType` error due to weak reference dropping.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This happens when using a `PeriodIndex` within a `MultiIndex` and attempting to retrieve the level values, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout its usage within a `MultiIndex`. This can be achieved by properly handling the weak reference to prevent it from being dropped prematurely.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if self._engine_type is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected version, we check if the `_engine_type` is not None before returning the result. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained and the `PeriodIndex` is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the `NoneType` error.
