The issue arises from the weak reference to the `self` object being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To fix this, we should ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` has finished using it.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

By keeping the weak reference to the `self` object until after the `_engine_type` function has finished using it, we avoid the issue of the weak reference being dropped prematurely, which resolves the original problem and satisfies the expected input/output values.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
