### Potential Error Locations
The potential error location in the buggy function is the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. It seems that the weak reference to the period is not being maintained properly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the PeriodIndex.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is causing the error described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the period is maintained properly so that the PeriodEngine can receive the PeriodIndex as expected.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced `period = weakref.ref(self)` with `period = weakref.proxy(self)`. This ensures that a weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained properly, preventing it from being dropped before intended. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
