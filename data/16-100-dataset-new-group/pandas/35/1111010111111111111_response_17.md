## Correction of the bug

The bug is caused by the weak reference to `self`, which is being lost before it is intended. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To fix this, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is not lost prematurely.

A strategy to fix the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to hold a strong reference to `self` while creating the weak reference and using the strong reference in the rest of the function. This will prevent the premature loss of the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Hold a strong reference to self to avoid premature loss of weak reference
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self is lost prematurely.")
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is retained throughout the function, ensuring that the intended `PeriodIndex` is passed to the `PeriodEngine` without being lost prematurely. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test case passes.
