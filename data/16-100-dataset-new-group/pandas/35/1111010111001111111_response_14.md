        Optional period-like data to construct index with.
    copy : bool
        Make a copy of input ndarray.
    freq : str or period object, optional
        One of pandas period strings or corresponding objects.
    year : int, array, or Series, default None

    # this is the fixed function
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
```
The bug in the original `_engine` function is in the use of `@cache_readonly` decorator. This decorator has a bug where it doesn't handle weakrefs correctly, leading to the weakref being dropped before it is supposed to.

To fix this, we remove the `@cache_readonly` decorator and make `_engine` a regular method rather than a cached property. This would ensure that the weakref is maintained as expected.

The corrected version of the buggy function is implemented above.

By removing the `@cache_readonly` decorator and converting `_engine` to a regular method, the weakref to `self` will be maintained as expected, fixing the bug and ensuring that the weakref is not dropped prematurely. This fix will resolve the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes as expected.

This correction makes the `_engine` function more predictable in its use of weakrefs and resolves the bug caused by premature reference dropping.
