## Analysis
The `_engine` function is using a weak reference of `self` to create a period, and then it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The issue seems to be related to the weak reference not being maintained properly, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error occurs in the creation and usage of the weak reference `period`. It seems that the weak reference is not being maintained properly, leading to it being dropped before intended.

## Cause of the Bug
The weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets `None` instead of the PeriodIndex. This leads to an error and incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of `self` is being maintained properly and not being dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by using a weak reference object and accessing the referenced object when needed.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Access the referenced object when needed
    return self._engine_type(weak_period(), len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and accessed when needed, ensuring that the PeriodEngine receives the correct PeriodIndex. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
