The buggy function `_engine` is using a decorator `@cache_readonly`, which is likely causing the issue.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is calling methods that eventually checks the monotonicity of levels, but the `_engine` which is expected to be an instance of some `PeriodEngine` is returning `None` instead of the expected value which is causing the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `@cache_readonly` decorator and ensure that the `_engine` function properly returns an instance of `PeriodEngine` as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

Removing the `@cache_readonly` decorator and returning an instance of `_engine_type` by adding `()` at the end of the return statement should fix the issue and make the corrected function return a valid `PeriodEngine` instance.
