The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference usage and the construction of the `_engine_type`. However, without the definition of the `_engine_type` it's difficult to pin down the exact issue.

It's apparent that the `_engine` function is trying to use a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self` in order to avoid creating a reference cycle. The weak reference is then used to create and return an `_engine_type` object.

The bug might be related to how the weak reference to `self` is being used or how the `_engine_type` object is being constructed.

To fix the bug, we need to understand the purpose of the `_engine` function and the `_engine_type` object, and then revise the implementation accordingly.

Without knowledge of the `_engine_type` object, it's difficult to provide a corrected version of the `_engine` function. However, assuming the intent is to create an `_engine_type` object using a weak reference to `self`, the corrected function might look something like this:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return _engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Replace `_engine_type` with the correct class/type that should be used. Additionally, ensure that the weak reference is being used correctly and that the construction of the `_engine_type` object is accurate.

It's important to understand the purpose and implementation of the `_engine_type` in order to provide a more accurate correction.
