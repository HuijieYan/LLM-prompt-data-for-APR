The buggy function `_engine` is causing an AttributeError because it's returning a 'NoneType' object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object. This is likely due to an issue with the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call within the function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` is returning a valid `PeriodEngine` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```

By adding a check for `None` and raising a `ValueError` if `engine` is `None`, we can ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object.

This should fix the AttributeError and ensure that the failing test passes.
