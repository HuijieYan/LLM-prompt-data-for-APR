The buggy function `_engine` has a  `cache_readonly` decorator, which means the function should return the same value for every call and the result should be cached. However, the `weakref.ref` method is returning an object with a `NoneType` attribute when it should be returning a reference to `self`.

To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref` method should be used to create a weak reference to `self` and then return `period()`, dereferencing the weak reference, instead of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # dereference the weak reference
```
