The buggy function `_engine` is using a `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, it is not clear what `_engine_type` is or how it is implemented.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. This may lead to issues with reference counting and could potentially cause the weak reference to become invalid before it is used.

To fix the bug, it's important to understand the purpose of using a weak reference in this context and ensure that it is being used correctly. If the weak reference is meant to prevent circular reference and potential memory leaks, then the implementation should be carefully reviewed and potentially redesigned to achieve the desired behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the function based on the assumption that the weak reference is intended to prevent circular references:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `weakref.proxy` is used to create a weak reference to `self` without the need for manually referencing the `PeriodIndex` object. This should help prevent circular references without causing issues with reference counting.
