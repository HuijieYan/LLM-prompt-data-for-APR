Based on the information provided, here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Explanation:
The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. The corrected version addresses this by ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is passed as intended.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and allow the failing test to pass.
