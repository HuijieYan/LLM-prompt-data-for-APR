To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor. Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray
from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import DatetimeIndexOpsMixin

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other class members)
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        
        # Pass the weak reference to the _engine_type constructor
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self), freq=self.freq)
```

In this corrected version, we create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object using `weakref.ref(self)` and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the length of the index and the frequency. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained until it is actually needed by the engine, preventing premature dropping of the reference.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped before it is intended to, allowing the `_engine` function to work correctly in scenarios where weak referencing is required.
