The bug in the `_engine` function is likely related to the `weakref` usage and the creation of the `period` object. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to `NoneType` object, which suggests that the `_engine_type` is not properly handling the `weakref` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference (`period`) is properly passed to the `_engine_type` without losing its reference.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to use the weak reference in a more robust way, ensuring that it maintains a reference to the original `self` object.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This updated version uses `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self` without losing the reference. By doing so, it ensures that the weak reference is maintained and passed to the `_engine_type` as intended.

With this corrected version, the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` should pass without encountering the AttributeError while asserting `x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels`.
