The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to an AttributeError. The expected output is that the test should return True.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the lifetime of the engine. We can achieve this by creating a weak reference to `self` outside of the cache_readonly decorator, and then using the weak reference inside the _engine function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

cache_readonly(_engine)
```

With this change, the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the lifetime of the engine, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

This correction should resolve the issue and ensure that the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` passes, returning True as expected.
