The bug in the given function is that it is using weakref.ref(self) incorrectly. The weakref.ref() function returns a weak reference to the object passed to it, but it does not call the _engine_type constructor with the correct arguments.

To fix the bug, we should create a weak reference to the object and then access the object it is referencing.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we are creating a weak reference to the object `self` and then accessing the object using `period()`. This will correctly pass the weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor.
