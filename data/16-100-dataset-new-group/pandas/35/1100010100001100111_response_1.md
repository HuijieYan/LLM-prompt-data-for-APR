The bug in the _engine function is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex, resulting in the error raised in the test case provided in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakref is properly maintained and used within the _engine function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
