The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using the `cache_readonly` decorator, but it does not have a corresponding `_clear_caches` method, which may cause issues with caching when the attributes of the `PeriodIndex` instance change.

To fix this bug, we can remove the `cache_readonly` decorator from the `_engine` function, and use a regular method instead.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By removing the `cache_readonly` decorator, we avoid potential caching issues and ensure that the `_engine` method is called every time, providing a correct behavior for the function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
