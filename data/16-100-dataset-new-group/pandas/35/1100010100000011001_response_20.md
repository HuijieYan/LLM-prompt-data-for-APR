#### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function are with the use of the `weakref.ref` and the `self._engine_type` methods.

#### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `self` object, but it doesn't actually access the `self` object to keep it alive. This means that when `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called, `self` may have already been garbage collected.

#### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that the `self` object is kept alive when creating the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`. One way to do this is by creating a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference.

#### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self to keep it alive
    period = self
    # Create a weak reference to the strong reference of self
    weak_period = weakref.ref(period)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```
In the corrected version, we create a strong reference `period` to `self` before creating a weak reference `weak_period` to it. This ensures that `self` is kept alive and can be accessed within the `_engine_type` method.
