The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function that returns the result of `_engine_type` being called with the parameters `period` and `len(self)`. The `period` is a weak reference to `self`, and `len(self)` is the length of the object `self`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to assert that all levels of `idx2` are monotonic, but it raises an `AttributeError` because the `PeriodEngine` receives a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be maintained and used properly within the `_engine` function.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

In this corrected version, the return value of `_engine_type(period, len(self))` is immediately called with `()`, ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained throughout the call.
