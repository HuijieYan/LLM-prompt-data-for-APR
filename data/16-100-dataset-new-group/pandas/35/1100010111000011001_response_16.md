The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return the result of calling `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self` as arguments. However, it seems to be missing the instance `self` in the call to `_engine_type`, and `period` is assigned the result of the weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` but never actually used.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is never being utilized and `self` is not being passed into the `_engine_type` function.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that both the weak reference and the original `self` instance are passed to the `_engine_type` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, period, len(self))
```

By passing the weak reference `period` and the original `self` instance to the `_engine_type` function, the corrected code should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
