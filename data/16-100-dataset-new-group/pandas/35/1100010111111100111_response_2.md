To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely before it is used within the PeriodEngine. We can do this by modifying the _engine function to hold a strong reference to the PeriodIndex until it's finished using it.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Hold a strong reference to self to prevent it from being prematurely garbage collected
    self._period_ref = self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By adding a strong reference to self with self._period_ref = self, we prevent the PeriodIndex from being prematurely garbage collected before it is used within the PeriodEngine.

This correction should resolve the issue and ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped before it's intended to be used in the PeriodEngine. As a result, the failing test should produce the expected output without raising an error.

This correction addresses the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" by ensuring that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is properly maintained until it's utilized in the PeriodEngine.
