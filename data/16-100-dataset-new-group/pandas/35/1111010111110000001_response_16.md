The bug is likely located in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. When the failing test calls `is_monotonic` on `idx2.levels`, it runs into an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object having no attribute `view`. This is caused by an issue with the `_engine` function. The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, and this `_engine_type` may be returning `None` in a certain case, causing the `NoneType` error.

To resolve this, we can add a guard clause to ensure the `_engine_type` is not `None` before attempting to call it. In addition, it's essential to ensure that `_engine_type` returns a valid object that can handle the subsequent calls to `is_monotonic`.

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    if engine_type:
        return engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type should not be None")
```

With the updated code, we first check if `_engine_type` is not `None` before attempting to create the engine object. If `_engine_type` is `None`, we raise a `ValueError`. Otherwise, we create the engine object using `_engine_type` and return it.
