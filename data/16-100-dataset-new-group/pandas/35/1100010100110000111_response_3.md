The bug in the provided function `_engine` is likely causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is in line with the error message indicating that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely and is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self is not None else None
```

With this modification, we are checking if `self` is not `None` before passing it to the `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is still available and prevents the AttributeError caused by a `NoneType` object being passed to the engine.

This correction should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and enable the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to pass without raising an error.
