The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` function that returns a value using a weak reference of 'self' to avoid a reference cycle. However, the bug might be related to how the weak reference is used in the `_engine_type` method.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checking if the resulting `MultiIndex` has monotonic levels. The failing test provides information about how the `PeriodIndex` is constructed and used, which could help in fixing the bug.

It seems that the bug might be related to how the weak reference `period` is used in the `_engine_type` method, resulting in the incorrect behavior of the `MultiIndex` constructed from the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we should review how the weak reference is being used in the `_engine_type` method and ensure that it is being used correctly to avoid any reference cycles.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
In the corrected version, we explicitly create a weak reference named `period_weakref` to `self` and then pass it to the `_engine_type` method, ensuring that we are using the weak reference correctly to avoid any reference cycles. This should address the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes.
