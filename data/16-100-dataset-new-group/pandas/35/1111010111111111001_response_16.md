Based on the provided information, it seems that the `_engine` function is trying to reference a weakref to `self` without properly handling the case where the instance is no longer available. This is likely leading to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error during runtime. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `weakref` does not return a `NoneType` object and that we handle the weak reference properly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self is no longer available.")
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to ensure that the weak reference `period()` is not `None` before attempting to create the engine. If the weak reference has been removed, a `RuntimeError` is raised.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the weak reference is handled properly, preventing the `AttributeError` from occurring.
