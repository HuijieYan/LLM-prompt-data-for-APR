The buggy function is `_engine`, which is a cached readonly property. The bug lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

The `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance which is then used to create the `_engine` using `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The bug here is that `period` is a weak reference, and when it is passed to `_engine_type`, it will only exist as long as the original `self` instance is alive. If the original `self` instance is garbage collected before the `_engine` is used, it will result in an error.

To fix the bug, the weak reference mechanism should be used properly, ensuring that it does not get garbage collected before it's used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.proxy(self)` is used instead of `weakref.ref(self)`. `weakref.proxy(self)` returns a proxy to `self`, which can be passed to `_engine_type` without the risk of being garbage collected before it is used.
