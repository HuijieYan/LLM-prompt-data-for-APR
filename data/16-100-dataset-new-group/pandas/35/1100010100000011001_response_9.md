#### Potential Errors
The use of the `weakref.ref()` and the `_engine_type` method might be causing the bug.

#### Bug Explanation
The `weakref.ref()` creates a weak reference to the `self` parameter, which means that it might return `None` if `self` is deallocated. Additionally, the `_engine_type` method may not be handling the weak reference correctly to create the engine.

#### Bug Fix Strategy
Ensure that the `weakref.ref()` returns a valid reference and that the `_engine_type` method can handle weak references appropriately.

#### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to avoid deallocation of self
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
