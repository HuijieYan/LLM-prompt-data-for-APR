The error in the provided function lies in the `_engine` method, which returns the `_engine_type` method using `self` and `len(self)` as arguments. The error message from the failing test indicates an AttributeError related to the `NoneType` object not having the attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `_engine` method returns the expected type, which is likely the `PeriodEngine` class or a similar type. This can be achieved by making sure that the `self._engine_type` method returns a valid engine object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is not None:  # Ensure the engine_type method returns a valid object
        return engine_type
    else:
        # Handle the case where engine_type is None
        raise ValueError("Failed to initialize engine")
```

This correction ensures that the `_engine` method returns a valid engine object and handles the case where the engine type is None. This should address the AttributeError and make the failing test pass.
