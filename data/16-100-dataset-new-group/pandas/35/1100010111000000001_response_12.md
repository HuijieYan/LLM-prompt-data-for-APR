Fixed version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._get_engine()

def _get_engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it doesn't call a separate `_get_engine` method to actually retrieve the engine. This can lead to unexpected behavior and failure to pass the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

By adding a separate `_get_engine` method, we can ensure that the engine is retrieved correctly and avoid any unexpected behavior.

Corrected version:
By adding a separate `_get_engine` method, we can ensure that the engine is retrieved correctly and avoid any unexpected behavior.

```python
def _get_engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
