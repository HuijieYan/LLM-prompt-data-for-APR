Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, it seems that the bug is related to weakrefs being lost when copying a PeriodIndex onto a MultiIndex. The issue causes the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex, leading to an error in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped when copying it onto a MultiIndex.

One approach to fix the bug is to modify the _engine function to prevent the weakly referenced PeriodIndex from being lost. We can do this by storing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex as an attribute of the class to ensure its preservation, and then using it to create the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we store the weakly referenced PeriodIndex as self._period_ref, which ensures that it is not lost when copying onto a MultiIndex. Then, we use self._period_ref to create the PeriodEngine.

With this correction, the weakref issue should be resolved, and the failing test should pass as expected.
