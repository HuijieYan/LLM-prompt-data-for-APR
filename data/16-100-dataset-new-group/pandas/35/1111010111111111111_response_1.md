Based on the information provided, the bug seems to be related to the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is still maintained even after the return value is assigned, ensuring that it is not prematurely dropped. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the failing test to pass.
