## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

Explanation:
The bug occurred because the weak reference to the PeriodIndex was not being properly retrieved in the _engine function, leading to a None being passed to the PeriodEngine instead of the actual PeriodIndex. This resulted in the failing test in test_get_level_values_when_periods.

To fix this, we need to modify the _engine function to correctly retrieve the weak reference to the PeriodIndex and pass it to the PeriodEngine.

By using period() instead of period in the return statement, we are correctly retrieving the weak reference and passing it to the PeriodEngine, resolving the bug and ensuring that the test passes as expected.

With this corrected version, the bug reported in the GitHub issue "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" will be resolved.
