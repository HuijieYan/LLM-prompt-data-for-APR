To fix the bug in the _engine function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained until it is used in the _engine_type constructor. The issue seems to be related to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the _engine function to use a weak reference in a way that ensures the reference is valid until it is used. One way to do this is to store the weak reference in a local variable and then use it to create the _engine_type.

Here is the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the period_ref variable, we ensure that the reference remains valid until it is used in the _engine_type constructor, fixing the bug.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
