### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using a cache decorator `cache_readonly`. This is causing issues when the function is called multiple times.

The failing test is calling the `test_get_level_values` function, where the `assert` statement is failing due to an `AttributeError`. The expected values and types of the relevant variables are not reflected in the error message.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because when the `_engine` function is called multiple times, it returns a weak reference to the `self` object, which then becomes `None` when it is accessed again. This results in the `AttributeError` where a `NoneType` object is accessed for the `view("i8")`.

### Bug Fix
The bug can be fixed by using a regular `@property` decorator instead of `@cache_readonly`. This will ensure that the `_engine` method can be called multiple times without returning a weak reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@property
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
