The bug in the given function is that it is using weakref.ref() incorrectly, resulting in a weak reference that may not work as intended. The weak reference should be created for the object itself, not its attribute. Additionally, the _engine_type method is not provided, so it is unclear how it should be used.

To fix this bug, we need to create a weak reference to the period index object itself and then use it to call the _engine_type method, passing the length of the index as an argument.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.period import _engine_type

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the period index object
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Call _engine_type method with the weak reference and length of the index
    return _engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

This fix ensures that the weak reference is created for the object itself and not its attribute, and it correctly uses the _engine_type method with the weak reference and length of the index.
