The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError in the failing test due to a 'NoneType' object not having the 'view' attribute. This suggests that the `_engine_type` method is not returning a valid object.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the weak reference creation. When creating a weak reference to `self`, it's possible that the weak reference is not properly being resolved when `_engine` is called, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly resolved when `_engine` is called.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we are resolving the weak reference and passing the actual `self` object to `_engine_type`.

With this fix, the failing test should now pass.
