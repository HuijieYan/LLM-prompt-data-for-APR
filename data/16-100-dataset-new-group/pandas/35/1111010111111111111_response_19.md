The bug in the `_engine` function for the `PeriodIndex` class causes the weak reference to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This issue leads to the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' when running the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until it is no longer needed. Additionally, the `PeriodEngine` should be modified to handle cases where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is not available.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function for the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

This fix ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until it is no longer needed. If the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is not available, the `_engine` function returns `None`.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
