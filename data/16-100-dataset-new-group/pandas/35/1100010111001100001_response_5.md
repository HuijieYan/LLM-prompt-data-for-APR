The bug in the `_engine` function is likely to be caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. The function is returning a weak reference to `self` instead of the actual reference, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to return the actual reference instead of a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
By returning the actual reference to `self` instead of a weak reference, the function should now work correctly and pass the failing test.

The corrected version of the `_engine` function should resolve the issue and the failing test should now pass.
