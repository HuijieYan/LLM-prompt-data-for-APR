## Solution
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the object `self`, but it is not being used properly.
2. The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being maintained properly, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the expected PeriodIndex.
3. To fix the bug, the weak reference should be maintained and utilized correctly to avoid the reference cycle and maintain access to the original object.
4. To fix the bug, we will modify the `_engine` function to properly maintain and utilize the weak reference to `self`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now properly maintain and utilize the weak reference to `self`, avoiding the reference cycle and resolving the bug.
