The bug in the provided function `_engine(self)` is that it returns `None`, causing the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' when used later in the code. 

To fix this bug, we need to replace the `@cache_readonly` decorator with the `@property` decorator. Also, we should replace the attribute access in the `return` statement from `self._engine_type` to `self.engine_type`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self.engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Note that the function now uses the `@property` decorator and replaces the attribute access with `self.engine_type`.

After making these changes, the function should work correctly without returning `None` and causing the AttributeError.
