The bug in the function `_engine` is that it is not correctly using the weak reference to `self` when creating the `period` object. The `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object, but the function is not using it in the correct way.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to use the weak reference object correctly and then create the `_engine_type` object using the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# fixed version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

By using the weak reference object `period` when calling `_engine_type` and passing the length of `self._values`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly used to avoid a reference cycle and prevent potential memory leaks.
