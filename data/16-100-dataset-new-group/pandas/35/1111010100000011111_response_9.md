## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is a cache_readonly decorator and is supposed to return the `_engine_type` class with a weakref of the `PeriodIndex` and its length. The issue on GitHub suggests that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before it should be, causing the `PeriodIndex` to get a `None` instead of the expected weakref. This leads to an error when checking if the levels are monotonic.

## Bug
The bug is that the weakref of the `PeriodIndex` is not being maintained properly, leading to a `None` being passed instead of the expected weakref.

## Fix
To fix the bug, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` should be maintained properly to ensure that it is not dropped before it should be. We can achieve this by modifying the way the weakref is created and accessed.

## Corrected code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
