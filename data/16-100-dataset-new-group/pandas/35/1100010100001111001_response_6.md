## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` but is not using it in the `_engine_type` function. This results in a reference cycle being created, which can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior. 

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly use the weak reference when calling the `_engine_type` function.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
