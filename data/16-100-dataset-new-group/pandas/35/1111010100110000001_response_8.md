It seems that the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning a `NoneType` object. We can infer that the issue resides in the `_engine` method implementation where it is constructing the instance of `PeriodEngine`, but it's not properly returning a valid instance due to a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, we can revise the `_engine` method to create a proper instance of `PeriodEngine` and return it. We can provide the `period` weak reference as the first argument, followed by `len(self)`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference of self to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Instantiate the PeriodEngine and return it
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```
By correcting the `_engine` method with the above approach, the `NoneType` error should be resolved. This should provide a valid instance of `PeriodEngine` which will subsequently prevent the `AttributeError` when accessing the view attribute.
