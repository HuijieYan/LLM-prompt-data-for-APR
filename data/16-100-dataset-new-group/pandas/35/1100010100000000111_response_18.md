The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when copying a `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, weakrefs are lost, causing an error when checking for monotonicity.

The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` but not properly maintaining it, leading to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it should be.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained throughout the function, preventing it from being dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
