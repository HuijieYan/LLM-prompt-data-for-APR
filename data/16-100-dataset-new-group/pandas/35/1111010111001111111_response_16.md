To fix the bug, we need to update the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class to correctly instantiate the `PeriodEngine` with a weak reference to the `self` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Check if self is still a valid reference, if not, return None
    if period() is None:
        return None
    
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `self` object is checked before instantiating the `PeriodEngine`. If the weak reference is no longer valid, the method returns `None`.

This correction addresses the issue described in the GitHub post and also handles the potential bug causing the failing test case.
