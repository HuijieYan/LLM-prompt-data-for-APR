The buggy function `_engine` takes a parameter `self`.

The expected values and types of the variables are not provided for the failing test execution, so it is difficult to diagnose the bug without this information. However, we can make some assumptions based on the given code and the nature of the bug.

Based on the code provided, it seems that the bug is related to the use of the `weakref` module and how it is being used with the `period` object. Weak references are a way to reference an object without preventing it from being garbage collected, which suggests that the bug might be related to memory management or object references.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference is being used correctly and that it does not introduce any memory leaks or reference cycles.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we create a weak reference to the `self` object and then pass the result of calling `period_weakref()` to `_engine_type` in order to obtain the referenced object. This ensures that the weak reference is being used correctly and should fix the potential bug related to memory management and reference cycles.
