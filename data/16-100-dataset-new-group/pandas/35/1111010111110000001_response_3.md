The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`. This function has a decorator `@cache_readonly`, and it tries to instantiate `self._engine_type` with the `period` argument being a weak reference to `self`. The function is failing with an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is executed.

The cause of the bug is most likely due to the `_engine_type` method not returning a valid object due to the weak reference. The bug is failing for `MultiIndex`, which uses `PeriodIndex`, and the failing `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to Monotonicity checks.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should handle weak references properly and ensure that `self._engine_type` returns a valid object without causing the `AttributeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Failed to initialize the engine type.")
```
This correction ensures that the weak reference `period` is used properly and that a valid `engine` is returned. Additionally, it provides proper handling if the engine cannot be initialized.
