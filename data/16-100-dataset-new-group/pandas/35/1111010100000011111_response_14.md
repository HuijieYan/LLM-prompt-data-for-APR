The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an issue where weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects are being dropped too early, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing errors when checking if the levels are monotonic in a MultiIndex. The expected output is for the check to return `True`.

One strategy for fixing this bug is to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to pass a weak reference of the `self` object to the `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this fix, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object will be maintained until its intended use by the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
