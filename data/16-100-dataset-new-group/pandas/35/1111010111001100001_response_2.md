The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be due to the use of `weakref.ref` to create a reference to `self` which can lead to a reference cycle. This is likely causing the buggy behavior observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we can create a weak reference to `self._data` instead of `self`. This will prevent the reference cycle and should resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self._data to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._data)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test.
