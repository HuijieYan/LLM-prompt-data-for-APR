## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `_engine` which is using `@cache_readonly` decorator.
2. The error message is indicating an `AttributeError: 'NoneType'` in the function `is_monotonic_increasing` in the `IndexEngine`. This error is related to `weakly referenced PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended.
3. The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not being maintained properly, resulting in `NoneType` being passed to the `IndexEngine`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is kept alive in the `_engine` function so that it does not get dropped unexpectedly.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object by storing it in a class attribute. This will prevent the object from being garbage collected prematurely.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Corrected _engine function
    _period_ref = None  # Class attribute to store the PeriodIndex reference

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        # Store the weak reference in the class attribute to maintain a strong reference
        self._period_ref = period()
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```
