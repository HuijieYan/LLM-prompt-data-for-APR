The bug in the function is that it is creating a weak reference to the 'self' object and then passing it to '_engine_type' as the first argument. This will result in the weak reference being used instead of the actual 'self' object, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the weak reference and simply pass the 'self' object to '_engine_type'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
