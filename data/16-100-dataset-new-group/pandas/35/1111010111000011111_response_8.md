## Analysis
1. The buggy function is "_engine" within the class "PeriodIndex". It uses a weakref to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The potential error lies in the weakref usage and how it interacts with the _engine_type method.
3. The bug causes the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This leads to the failing test case as described in the GitHub issue.
4. A strategy for fixing the bug could be to ensure that the weakref is maintained until the PeriodEngine is finished using it.
5. Given the analysis, the corrected version of the function should maintain the weakly referenced PeriodIndex until it is used by the PeriodEngine.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```
