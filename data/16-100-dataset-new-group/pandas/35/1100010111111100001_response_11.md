The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to avoid a reference cycle and pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` but it seems that the weak reference is not being used properly. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the weak reference is not being resolved correctly and is resulting in a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is resolved properly and the correct object is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    resolved_period = period()  # Resolve weak reference
    return self._engine_type(resolved_period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weakref is resolved using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is resolved and the correct object is used, thus preventing the 'NoneType' object error.
