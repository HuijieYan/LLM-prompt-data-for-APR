## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then pass it to `_engine_type` method. The purpose of using a weak reference is to avoid creating a reference cycle, which is a good practice.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error is likely due to the weak reference to `self` being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained for the duration required by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by declaring a strong reference to `self` within the `_engine` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self to avoid premature dropping of weak reference
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
