The buggy function `_engine` appears to be using a `cache_readonly` decorator, indicating that it is supposed to cache the result of the function and return the cached result on subsequent calls. The function then creates a weak reference to the `self` object and returns the result of calling `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`.

The potential error in the function is with the caching mechanism. If the function is called multiple times with the same `self` object, it should return the cached result rather than re-computing it. However, it doesn't appear to have a mechanism to check for a cached result and return it, which could cause unnecessary re-computation.

The cause of the bug is that the caching mechanism is not correctly implemented, so the function could potentially re-compute the result every time it is called with the same `self` object.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to implement a proper caching mechanism that checks for a cached result and returns it if it exists. This can be achieved using a conditional check to see if the result is already cached, and if so, returning the cached result. If not, the function should compute the result, cache it, and return it.

Here's the corrected version of the function with a proper caching mechanism:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._cached_engine
```

In this corrected version, we check if `_cached_engine` exists as an attribute of `self`. If it does, we return it. If not, we compute the `_engine` result, cache it as `_cached_engine`, and return it.
