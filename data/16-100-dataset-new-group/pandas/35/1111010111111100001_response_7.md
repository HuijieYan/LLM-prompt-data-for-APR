The bug seems to be related to the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message suggests that there is an issue with the `_do_monotonic_check` method in the `IndexEngine` class, which is likely caused by an incorrect return value from the `_engine` function.

The `_engine` function uses a `weakref` to create a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, then returns an instance of `self._engine_type` initialized with this weak reference and the length of the index.

Looking at the failing test, it seems to involve creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and checking monotonicity, which triggers the error due to the invalid return value from the `_engine` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid instance of `self._engine_type` initialized with the correct references.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine.set_data(self._values, self.freq)
    return engine
```

In the corrected version, after creating the instance of `self._engine_type`, the `engine.set_data` method is called to set the data values and frequency, ensuring that the engine is properly initialized before returning it. This should address the issue with the invalid return value and resolve the failing test.
