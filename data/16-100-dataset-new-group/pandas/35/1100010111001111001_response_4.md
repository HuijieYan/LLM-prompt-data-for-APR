The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. However, this implementation seems unnecessary and might be causing unexpected behavior.

It appears that the function is attempting to avoid a reference cycle by using a weak reference. However, the weak reference is not being utilized correctly, leading to the buggy behavior.

To fix the bug, the usage of weak references can be removed altogether, as it seems unnecessary in this context.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By removing the unnecessary weak reference and directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, the bug should be fixed. The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
