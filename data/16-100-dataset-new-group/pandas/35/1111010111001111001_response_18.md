The bug in the function `_engine` is that it is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object of the `PeriodIndex` class, but it is not done correctly. This can lead to a reference cycle issue and potential memory leaks.

To fix the bug, we can simply use the `weakref.proxy` method to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the weak reference to the `self` object is created correctly, and it should resolve the potential reference cycle issue and memory leaks.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case.
