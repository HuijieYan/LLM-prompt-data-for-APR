The bug in the provided function is that it is using weakref.ref() incorrectly. The weakref.ref() function returns a weak reference to the object which should be called with the original object to get a strong reference. However, in the provided code, it is directly passing the weak reference to _engine_type, which is incorrect and causing the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to create a strong reference from the weak reference using the () operator and then pass it to _engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the weak reference `period` is called with `()` to obtain a strong reference before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This should resolve the bug and ensure the function works as intended.

To ensure the fix is effective, run the failing tests again after applying the corrected code to verify that the bug has been resolved.
