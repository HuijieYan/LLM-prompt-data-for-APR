The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, which is causing the function to return incorrect results.

The `weakref.ref` function is used to create a weak reference to the object `self`, but the returned `period` variable is not being properly dereferenced when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This means that the `period` variable is being passed as a weak reference to `self._engine_type`, which is likely causing the incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we should properly dereference the weak reference before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This can be done by calling the `period` object as a function, which will return the original object that the weak reference was created from.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we are properly dereferencing the weak reference and passing the original object to `self._engine_type`, which should fix the bug.
