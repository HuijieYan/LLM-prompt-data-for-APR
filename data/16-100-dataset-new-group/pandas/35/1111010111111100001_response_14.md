The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test to fail.

The bug appears to be related to the `PeriodEngine` class, where the `vgetter` method is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError`. This is likely causing the `is_monotonic` property to fail, resulting in the test failure.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` properly initializes and returns the correct value for the `vgetter`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine._invariants()
    return engine
```

By adding the `_invariants()` method to the `engine` object and calling it before returning, we ensure that the engine is properly initialized, which should fix the `NoneType` error and the subsequent test failure.
