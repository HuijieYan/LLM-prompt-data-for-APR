## Analysis
The `_engine` function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, and then returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` uses the `is_monotonic` property, which in turn uses the `_engine` function to return a view. The error indicates an `AttributeError` when trying to access `view` on a `NoneType` object.

The GitHub issue states that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug appears to be related to the weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` within the `_engine` function, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` property on the `NoneType` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is preserved until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the weak reference creation and usage within the `_engine` function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Create a strong reference to the PeriodIndex before calling _engine_type
    period_index = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_index, len(self))
```

By creating a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` before calling `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference does not get dropped prematurely, resolving the issue with weakrefs being lost. This should address the `AttributeError` experienced in the failing test, allowing it to pass successfully.
