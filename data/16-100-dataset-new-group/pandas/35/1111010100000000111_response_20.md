## Analysis:
The `@cache_readonly` decorator indicates that the `_engine` function is a cached property, meaning the result is computed once and then cached for future access. The issue described on GitHub suggests that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This points to a potential issue with the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function.

## Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the weak reference usage within the `_engine` function, where the weak reference to `self` is being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by how the weak reference to `self` is being handled, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This results in incorrect behavior and the error described in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is handled correctly within the `_engine` function. This may involve adjusting how the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type` or ensuring that the weak reference is maintained for the intended duration.

## Corrected Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a strong reference to self to ensure it does not get garbage collected prematurely
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, a strong reference to `self` is maintained by storing the weak reference in the `self._period_ref` attribute. This ensures that `self` is not garbage collected prematurely and is available as expected for the `PeriodEngine` construction.
