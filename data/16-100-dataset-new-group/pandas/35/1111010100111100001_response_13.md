The bug is likely caused by the `_engine_type` function, which is not properly handling the weak reference passed to it. As a result, it is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to the AttributeError when attempting to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference properly and ensure that it returns a valid `_engine_type` object.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is None:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine type")
    return engine_type
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function will properly handle the weak reference and ensure that the `_engine_type` object is not None before returning it. This should fix the bug and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
