Based on the analysis, it appears that the `_engine` function is likely intended to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object to avoid a reference cycle. However, the weak reference is not being used in the `_engine_type` call. This may result in the `self` object being held in memory longer than necessary, potentially leading to memory leaks.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to correctly use the weak reference when creating the `_engine_type` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period_ref` is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of directly passing `self`. This should ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object can be garbage collected when it is no longer needed, addressing the potential memory leak issue.
