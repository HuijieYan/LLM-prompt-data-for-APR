The buggy function `_engine` is using a weakref to create a weak reference to the `self` parameter of the function, which is an instance of the `PeriodIndex` class. The weak reference is then passed to the `_engine_type` method to create an engine with some metadata.

The bug causes the weak reference to be lost prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This issue is described in the GitHub bug report, where it is expected that the weak references should not be dropped before intended.

To fix this bug, we can ensure that the weak reference to `self` is kept alive until it is no longer needed by storing it as an instance attribute. Then, we can use the kept weak reference to create the engine.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other class definitions)

    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, month=None, quarter=None, day=None, hour=None, minute=None, second=None, tz=None, dtype=None):
        # ... (other initialization code)
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass the stored weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we store a weak reference to `self` as an instance attribute `_period_weakref` during the initialization of the `PeriodIndex` class. This keeps the weak reference alive until it is no longer needed. Then, in the `_engine` function, we pass the stored weak reference to the `_engine_type` method.

This approach ensures that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
