The bug in the provided function is that it is attempting to use weakref.ref with an invalid input. The weakref.ref function expects a single argument that is a referenceable object, but in the buggy function, it is called with two arguments: `self` and `len(self)`.

To fix this bug, we need to change the input to weakref.ref to only pass `self` as the argument.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period)
```

By making this change, the function will correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object, and the bug should be fixed.

Now, in Case 1, with the corrected function, the return value of `_engine` will be a weak reference to the `self` object, and it should no longer cause any errors.
