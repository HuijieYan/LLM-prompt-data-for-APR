The bug is likely that the `_engine_type` function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type, resulting in the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns an object of the expected type, which should have a 'view' attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned a NoneType object")
    return engine
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to ensure that the `_engine_type` function does not return a `NoneType` object. If it does, a ValueError is raised, which will be detected and handled appropriately.
