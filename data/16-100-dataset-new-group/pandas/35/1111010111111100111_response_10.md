The issue with the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is that it returns a weak reference to `self` instead of the actual reference. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to an AttributeError when attempting to call the `view` method.

To fix this issue, the `_engine` function needs to return the actual reference to `self` instead of a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By returning `self` directly as the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, the weak reference issue can be resolved.

This fix should address the problem described in the GitHub issue and should allow the failing test to pass as expected.
