The buggy function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that it is intended to cache the return value of the function. However, the function does not actually contain any caching logic. Instead, it simply returns the result of calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This means that the function will recalculate the result on every call, defeating the purpose of caching.

To fix this, we should implement actual caching logic using a dictionary to store previously calculated values based on the input parameters. We can use the input parameters as the key for the cache and return the cached value if it exists, otherwise calculate the result, store it in the cache, and return it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function with caching logic
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine_cache'):
        self._engine_cache = {}
    
    key = (self._values, self)
    if key in self._engine_cache:
        return self._engine_cache[key]
    
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    self._engine_cache[key] = result
    return result
```

In this corrected version, we define a `_engine_cache` dictionary attribute on `self` to store cached results. We use a tuple of the input parameters (`self._values, self`) as the key for the cache. If the key exists in the cache, we return the cached result. If not, we calculate the result, store it in the cache, and return it. This ensures that the function will only calculate the result once for each unique set of input parameters.
