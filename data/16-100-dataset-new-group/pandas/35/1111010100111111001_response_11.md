The bug is caused by the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object, resulting in an `AttributeError`. This is occurring because the `weakref.ref` is not being properly used to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that a weak reference to `self` is properly passed to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```
In this corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `_engine_type` exists and returns the expected value. If it does, the weak reference `period` is passed to `_engine_type`, otherwise, `None` is returned.

This correction should resolve the `AttributeError` caused by the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object.
