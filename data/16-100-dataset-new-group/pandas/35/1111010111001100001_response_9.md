The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference `period` being passed to `_engine_type`. It appears that the weak reference might be inconsistently handled somewhere else in the code, leading to a reference cycle.

To fix this, we can modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` instead of using a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this fix, the reference to `self` will not create a reference cycle, and the function should work correctly.

After making this change, the failing test should pass, as the issue was related to the creation of the weak reference.
