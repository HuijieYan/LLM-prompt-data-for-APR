The issue with the buggy function is that it is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly using the weak reference `period`.

The correct approach is to dereference the weak reference and then call the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

By adding `()` at the end of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, it calls the dereferenced weak reference and returns the correct result.

This fix should address the issue and make the failing test pass.
