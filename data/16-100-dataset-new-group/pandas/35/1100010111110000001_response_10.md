The issue arises because the `_engine` function seems to be missing the `PeriodEngine` type, which is used to work with PeriodIndex objects. The failing test, `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, specifically tries to access the `is_monotonic` property of the index and is failing with an AttributeError due to the missing 'NoneType' object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be updated to correctly return the `PeriodEngine` type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas._libs.index import PeriodEngine

# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to return the correct `PeriodEngine` type, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass.
