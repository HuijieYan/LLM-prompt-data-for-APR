## Analysis

The error message indicates that the `_engine` function is returning a weakly referenced PeriodIndex that is getting dropped before it should, causing the PeriodEngine to get a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in an AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute of a NoneType object.

## Bug location
The bug is likely located in the `_engine` function where it is returning the weakly referenced `self` without handling the weak reference properly.

## Bug Cause
The weak reference of `self` is not being handled properly by the `_engine` function, leading to it being dropped prematurely and resulting in the AttributeError when trying to access the weak reference.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference of `self` should be properly managed in the `_engine` function to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely and that the PeriodEngine receives a valid reference.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
