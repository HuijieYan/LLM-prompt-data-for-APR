The issue with the provided code is that the weak reference `period` is not being correctly passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the view of a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be correctly passed to `_engine_type`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference `period` is correctly dereferenced using `period()`, which will pass the actual `PeriodIndex` object to `_engine_type`.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function returns the expected output.
