The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then passing it to the `_engine_type` function. This is intended to avoid creating a reference cycle, but it seems to be causing issues in the test scenario where `idx._get_level_values(level)` is being called on the `PeriodIndex`.

The weak reference may be causing the `_engine_type` to receive a reference that is already garbage collected by the time it is used, leading to unexpected behavior and possibly failure of the test.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be removed and the `self` object should be passed directly to the `_engine_type` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that a strong reference to the `self` object is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine_type` function, resolving any potential issues caused by weak references.

This corrected version should pass the failing test scenario.
