Based on the runtime values and the GitHub issue, it appears that the issue is related to the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex.

The current bug seems to be located in the _engine function. The weak reference period is being created, but it is not being stored properly and is causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference period is stored properly and passed to the PeriodEngine as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

In the corrected version, we are passing 'self' as the third argument to the _engine_type function, ensuring that the weak reference period is properly stored and passed to the PeriodEngine. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function works as expected.
