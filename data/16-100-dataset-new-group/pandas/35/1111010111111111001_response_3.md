The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the use of `weakref.ref` on `self` when creating `period`. This creates a weak reference to `self` and is not intended in this context. It seems that the intent was to pass `self` as a weak reference to the `_engine_type`. However, the implementation is incorrect, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute on a `NoneType`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to pass `self` as a normal reference to the `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
