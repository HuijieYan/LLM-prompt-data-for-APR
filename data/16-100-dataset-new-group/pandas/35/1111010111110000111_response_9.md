The bug is potentially located within the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class, where a weak reference to `self` is being passed to the `_engine_type`. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object, causing an `AttributeError` when calling the `view` method.

The cause of the bug is the dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before it is intended to be dropped. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is retained for as long as it is needed, preventing premature dropping of the `PeriodIndex`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Retain a weakref of self to pass to _engine_type.
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is saved as an attribute `_period_ref` of the `PeriodIndex` instance, ensuring that it persists for as long as the `_engine` function is expected to use it. This fix should address the premature dropping of the weak reference and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

By implementing this fix, the failing test should pass, and the issue on GitHub should be resolved.
