The problem with the buggy function `_engine` is that it is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly, causing the weak reference to return `None` when it is needed.

To fix the bug, we can use the `weakref.proxy` method instead of `weakref.ref` to avoid the reference cycle issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref to avoid the reference cycle issue
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
