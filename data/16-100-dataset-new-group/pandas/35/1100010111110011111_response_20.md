## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```
In the corrected version, I've added a check to ensure that `self._engine_type` exists before it is called. This will prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
