The issue here is that the `_engine` function is returning a weakly referenced `self`, but the weak reference is not being properly handled, resulting in a `NoneType` error. To fix this, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference to `self` and use it to create the period engine.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` with parentheses, we're actually invoking the weak reference to get the original referenced object, which then can be passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

This should resolve the issue and the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
