Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex in the MultiIndex. The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is receiving a NoneType object instead of the intended PeriodIndex, leading to an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex is handled correctly and that the PeriodEngine receives the intended PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` instead of passing the weak reference of `self`. This ensures that the intended PeriodIndex is passed to the PeriodEngine without encountering the NoneType object issue caused by the weak reference.
