The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the weak reference is not being used correctly, leading to the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

The cause of the bug is that `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object, and it needs to be dereferenced to obtain the actual object. However, in the buggy function, `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates the weak reference but doesn't dereference it before passing it to `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` dereferences the weak reference, returning the actual object that it references, before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that we are using the actual object rather than the weak reference, fixing the AttributeError.
