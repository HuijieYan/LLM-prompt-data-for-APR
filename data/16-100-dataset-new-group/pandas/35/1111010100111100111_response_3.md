The bug in the provided function `_engine` seems to be related to the weak reference `period` being assigned the value `weakref.ref(self)` and then being passed to `_engine_type` to create the engine. However, the weak reference is not properly maintained, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we can revise the way the weak reference is used and maintained in the `_engine` function. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `weakref.proxy(self)` is used to create a weak reference to `self`, and it is then passed to `_engine_type` to create the engine. This ensures that a proper weak reference to `self` is maintained.

By making this change, the bug should be fixed and the failing test case should pass. This correction addresses the reported issue and resolves the error message that was encountered.
