The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an `AttributeError`. The function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, and the error is likely occurring because `self._engine_type` is not properly handling the `period` weak reference.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference properly and return the `_engine_type` with the appropriate arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.api import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

By using `PeriodEngine` instead of `self._engine_type` and passing the weak reference `period` along with the length of `self`, we ensure that the weak reference is handled properly and the `AttributeError` is resolved.

With this corrected version of the `_engine` function, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output values should be satisfied.
