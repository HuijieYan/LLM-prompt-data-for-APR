The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the `is_monotonic` attribute to raise an error when called on the `idx2` object in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference `period` being passed to `_engine_type`, which causes it to become a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference and prevent it from becoming a `NoneType`. We need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and not getting dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # call the weak reference to get the actual object
```

By calling the weak reference `period()` in the `return` statement, we ensure that it returns the actual object that the weak reference is pointing to, rather than letting it become a `NoneType`. This should resolve the issue and the failing test should now pass.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should return True as expected. The correction proposed here addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue.
