The issue is likely related to the `_engine_type` function being called with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the `self._engine_type` is returning None instead of the expected object with a 'view' attribute.

The `_engine_type` function is likely not returning a valid object, which could be causing the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid object instead of None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```
