# Case 1
- Input:
  - self: PeriodIndex object
  
- Expected output:
  - Type: _engine_type object
  - Value: Initialized _engine_type object with period reference and length of self

### Bug analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a PeriodIndex object. The intention is to avoid a reference cycle, but the implementation is incorrect.

The bug in the function lies in how the weak reference is handled and returned. The `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self` but doesn't actually dereference the weak reference to get the actual object.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference and return the actual object instead of the weak reference. We also need to pass the length of `self` when initializing the `_engine_type` object.

### Corrected code
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass the weakly referenced self and length of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
