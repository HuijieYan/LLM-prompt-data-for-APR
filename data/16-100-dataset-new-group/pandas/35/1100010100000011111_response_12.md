## Analysis:
The _engine function is using weakref to create a weak reference to self, but it is not being used properly. This is causing the PeriodIndex to be dropped before it is intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Bug Cause:
The weakref.ref(self) is not being passed to the _engine_type properly, causing the weak reference to be lost.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The weak reference to self needs to be passed to _engine_type as intended so that the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

## Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
