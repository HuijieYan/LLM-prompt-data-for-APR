Based on the provided information, the issue is related to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to get a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is leading to unexpected errors in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine. We can achieve this by modifying the _engine function to store the weak reference as an instance variable of the class, to prevent it from being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self as an instance variable
    self._weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an instance variable, we ensure that it remains valid for as long as the PeriodIndex instance is in use. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected output for the failing tests.
