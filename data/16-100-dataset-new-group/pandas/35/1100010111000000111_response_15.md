To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is being handled properly, so it is not dropped before intended. We can modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference and avoid the issue of the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

This change ensures that the weak reference to `self` is stored in `period_ref` and used when calling `self._engine_type`. By using the weak reference properly, the issue of dropping the reference prematurely is resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue.
