The bug in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class is likely causing the failing test. The error message suggests that the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which indicates that the _engine function is not returning the expected type.

The bug is likely in the _engine function's return statement:
```python
return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The cause of the bug is that the weakref.ref() is not being correctly initialized and passed to self._engine_type.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly initialize the weak reference and pass it to self._engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self, lambda x: None)  # Initialize the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))  # Pass the weak reference to self._engine_type
```
