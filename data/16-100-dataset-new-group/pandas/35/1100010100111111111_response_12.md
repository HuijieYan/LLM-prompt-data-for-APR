The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when calling `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`. The input `self._values` is a PeriodArray and `self` is a PeriodIndex. The expected output is for the `all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` to return True.

The bug is likely caused by the weak reference to `self` being dropped prematurely before it is intended to, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be retained until the PeriodEngine no longer needs it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The relative path of the correct file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas._libs.index import PeriodEngine

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine._self_ref = period
    return engine
```

With this corrected version, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass.
