The `@cache_readonly` decorator is used to decorate the `_engine` function, which is supposed to return the engine type for the period index. The bug in this function is that it is not properly creating a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

The buggy function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it should use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead. This is because `weakref.ref` returns a weak reference object that does not support attribute access and therefore cannot be used in place of `self`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weak reference `period` can be used just like the original `self` object, preventing the reference cycle issue.

Once this correction is made, the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test should pass without any issues.

```python
def test_get_level_values_when_periods():
    # GH33131. See also discussion in GH32669.
    # This test can probably be removed when PeriodIndex._engine is removed.
    from pandas import Period, PeriodIndex

    idx = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [PeriodIndex([Period("2019Q1"), Period("2019Q2")], name="b")]
    )
    idx2 = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)]
    )
    assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)
```
