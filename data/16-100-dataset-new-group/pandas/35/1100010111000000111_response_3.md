The potential error in the buggy function is that the weak reference to `self` (period) is not being used correctly when initializing `_engine_type`. This is causing the `period` to be dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The buggy function can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference of `self` is properly utilized when initializing `_engine_type`. This will prevent the period from being dropped before intended and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is properly invoked using the `period()` method, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as expected.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub and make the failing test pass.
