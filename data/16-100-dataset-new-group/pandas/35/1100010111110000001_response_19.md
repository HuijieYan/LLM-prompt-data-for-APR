The bug appears to be in the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. When called, it returns a weak reference to `self` but then immediately uses it to call `self._engine_type` with `len(self)` as an argument. However, if `self` is garbage-collected before `_engine_type` is called, the weak reference will return `None`, leading to the AttributeError seen in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to create a strong reference to `self` before calling `_engine_type`. This will ensure that `self` is not garbage-collected until after the call to `_engine_type` has completed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Using a strong reference to avoid garbage collection
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the corrected function should pass the failing test without raising an AttributeError.
