The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an issue where weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This issue leads to an error being raised when checking for monotonicity in the levels of a `MultiIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout its usage. One way to achieve this is to use a `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to maintain a weak reference to `self` without the need to explicitly dereference it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is maintained using `weakref.proxy(self)` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly maintained and prevents it from being dropped prematurely, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
