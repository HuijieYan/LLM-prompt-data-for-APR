The bug in the provided function is caused by the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before it is intended to, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This causes the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error.

The strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is maintained until it is used by the PeriodEngine, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing the reference to the weakly-referenced self in a local variable `period` and then passing it to the `engine_type` constructor, we ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
