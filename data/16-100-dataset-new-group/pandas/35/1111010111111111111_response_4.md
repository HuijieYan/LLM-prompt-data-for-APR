## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` in the `_engine` function. It appears that the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained properly and that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) is stored in the `period_ref` variable, and this reference is then passed to the `_engine_type` constructor to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to `self`. This change should address the issue with weak referencing and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
