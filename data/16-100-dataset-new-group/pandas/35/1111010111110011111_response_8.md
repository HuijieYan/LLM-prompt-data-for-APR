The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, but it is likely not creating the weak reference correctly. This results in an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when accessing the weakly-ref'd object.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being correctly established, resulting in a `NoneType` object being accessed instead of the `PeriodIndex` object, leading to the attribute error.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should create the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object correctly and return the `_engine_type` with the weak reference instead of the length of the `PeriodIndex`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref)
```

This corrected version should establish the weak reference properly and resolve the issue posted on GitHub, resulting in a passing test.
