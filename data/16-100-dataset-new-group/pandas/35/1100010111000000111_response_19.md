## Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. The issue seems to be related to weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing the failing test in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped too early, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix Strategy
The fix strategy involves ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is held throughout the duration of the `_engine` function. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable or instance attribute within the class.

## The corrected version of the function
```python

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    self._weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref_period, len(self))
```
