The issue seems to be related to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before it's intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to use a weak reference to the PeriodIndex. This can be done by storing a weak reference to `self` and passing it to the `_engine_type` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)`, we are ensuring that a weak reference to the `self` object is passed to the `_engine_type` function, preventing the reference cycle and potential memory leaks.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
