Based on the analysis, the issue seems to be that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is getting dropped before its intended use. This causes the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex needs to be maintained until its intended use within the `_engine` function. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable scoped to the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Store the weak reference in a local variable
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is stored in the local variable `period_ref`, maintaining the reference until its use in the `_engine_type` function. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
