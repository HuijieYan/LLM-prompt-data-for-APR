### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using the `weakref` module to create a weak reference to the `self` object, and then it uses this weak reference to pass to the `_engine_type` function. The error message suggests that the `_engine` is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected result, causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is likely a problem with the weak reference. The weak reference may not be properly referencing the `self` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Ensure that the weak reference is properly created and maintained within the function.
- Check for any potential issues with the garbage collection of the weak reference.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
In the corrected function, the `period` is called as a function to extract the reference from the weak reference object before passing it to the `_engine_type` function. This will ensure that the reference to `self` is properly maintained instead of returning a `NoneType` object.
