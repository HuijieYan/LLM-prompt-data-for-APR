The bug in the provided function is that it is using weakref.ref incorrectly. The weakref.ref function returns a weak reference object for the given object, but it does not actually create a weak reference to the object. Instead, it returns a callable object that can be used to access the object. In the provided code, the function is using weakref.ref(self) to get a weak reference to self, but it's not actually creating a weak reference to the object.

To fix the bug, we can simply use weakref.proxy(self) instead of weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to the object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
