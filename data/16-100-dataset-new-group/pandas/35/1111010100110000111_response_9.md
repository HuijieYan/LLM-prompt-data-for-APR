The issue arises from the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class, which returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` gets dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the AttributeError when attempting to call the `view` method on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` does not get dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference to `self` before returning the engine.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    self._engine_ref = weakref.ref(engine)  # Maintain a weak reference to the engine
    return engine
```

By explicitly maintaining a weak reference to the engine within the `PeriodIndex` instance, we can prevent the premature dropping of the weak reference to `self`, resolving the bug.

Once this correction is made, the failing test should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
