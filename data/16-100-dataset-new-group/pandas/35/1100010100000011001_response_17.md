#### Expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
- period: weak reference to self
- return value: an instance of _engine_type with period and len(self)

### Explanation of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect use of weakref. The weakref.ref() function is used to create weak references to objects, but it is not being used properly in this function. 

### Bug-fixing strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly create a weak reference to the self object and pass it to the _engine_type function.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
