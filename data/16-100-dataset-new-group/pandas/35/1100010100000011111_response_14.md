Based on the provided information, the issue stems from the weak reference of the PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex, which causes the error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period_weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we maintain the weak reference to the PeriodIndex using a separate variable `period_weakref` and pass it to the PeriodEngine. This ensures that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely and resolves the issue described in the GitHub report.
