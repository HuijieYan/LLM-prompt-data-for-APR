The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class. It tries to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then return the result of calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. One potential error location is the weak reference creation using `weakref.ref(self)`. The weak reference creation could be causing the bug.

Given the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, the bug could be causing the `idx2` object to not have monotonic levels as expected.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference. This will ensure that there is no risk of a reference cycle and should fix the bug.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference creation is removed, and the `self` object is directly passed to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
