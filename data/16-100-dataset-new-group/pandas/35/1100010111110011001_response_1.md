The problematic part of the `_engine` function is the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This line creates a weak reference to `self`, but it isn't stored anywhere and is unused. This means that the `_engine` would always return `None` for `self`, leading to the error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access an attribute of `None`.

To fix the bug, we can use the weak reference as intended by storing it as a weak reference object and then accessing the referenced object when calling the `_engine_type` function. Additionally, we should handle the case where the weak reference returns `None` to avoid the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Access the referenced object, handling the case where it may be None
    referenced_obj = period()
    if referenced_obj is not None:
        return self._engine_type(referenced_obj, len(self))
    else:
        return None  # or handle the case appropriately based on the intended behavior
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function should now return the expected engine type object instead of `None`, resolving the AttributeError issue.
