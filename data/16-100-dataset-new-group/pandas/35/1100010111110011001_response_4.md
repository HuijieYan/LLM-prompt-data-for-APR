the buggy function uses a decorator `@cache_readonly` which should cache the returned value of the function. However, it seems that the `_engine` function is not returning the correct value, leading to an AttributeError.

The `_engine` function is supposed to return a weak reference to `self`, but it seems that it is not returning the correct type of reference, leading to a 'NoneType' object in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid weak reference to `self`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self) if self is not None else None
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self is not None else None
```
