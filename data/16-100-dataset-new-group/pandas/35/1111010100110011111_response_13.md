To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to `_engine_type`. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being accessed, which suggests that the weak reference is not being properly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self is not None else None
```

In this corrected version, we added a conditional check to ensure that the weak reference `self` is not `None` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should prevent the error of accessing attributes on a `NoneType` object.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and make sure that the `is_monotonic` check works as expected.
