The bug in the provided code is that the weak reference to the `self` object is being passed to the `_engine_type` function, but it is not being properly handled, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly handled and that the `PeriodIndex` object is captured and used within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are calling the `period` weak reference object as a function `period()` and passing it to the `_engine_type` function. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is properly captured and used within the `_engine` function, fixing the bug and addressing the GitHub issue.
