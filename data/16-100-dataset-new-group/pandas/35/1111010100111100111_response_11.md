The issue in the `_engine` function appears to be related to the weak reference used to prevent a reference cycle, which is causing the PeriodEngine to receive a NoneType. This is likely the cause of the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error when using certain methods on the index.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be accomplished by storing the weak reference as a class attribute rather than a local variable within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self as class attribute.
    self._weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as a class attribute, we ensure that the reference is maintained for the lifetime of the PeriodIndex object, resolving the weak reference issue.

This change should address the problem described in the GitHub issue and fix the failing test.
