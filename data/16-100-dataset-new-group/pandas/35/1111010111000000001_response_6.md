The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then use it to initialize an `_engine_type` object.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The weak reference is not properly handled, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The initialization of `_engine_type` may not be handling the weak reference properly.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference created in the `_engine` function is not being used correctly, leading to potential reference cycle issues and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be properly handled and used to initialize the `_engine_type` object.

```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc
import weakref

@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self.freq)
```

By properly handling the weak reference and passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the necessary arguments, the bug can be fixed. This corrected version of the `_engine` function should pass the failing test.
