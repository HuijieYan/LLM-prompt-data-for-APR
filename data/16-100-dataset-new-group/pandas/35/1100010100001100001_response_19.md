### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`. The purpose of using a weak reference is to avoid creating a reference cycle.

### Bug
The bug in the function is that it's not accessing the original object from the weak reference created using `weakref.ref`. This is causing the function to return incorrect values.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference created using `weakref.ref` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Dereference the weak reference before passing it to _engine_type
```
