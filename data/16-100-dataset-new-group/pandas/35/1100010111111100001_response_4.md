The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError in the failing test. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the `_engine` function is returning a NoneType instead of the expected index engine.

Upon analyzing the problem, it seems that the weak reference creation and usage in the `_engine` function is incorrect, causing the returned value to be NoneType instead of the expected index engine.

To fix this bug, we need to properly create and use the weak reference to avoid the reference cycle and ensure that the index engine is being returned correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_reference = weakref.ref(self)
    index_engine = self._engine_type(period_reference(), len(self))
    return index_engine
```

By using the `period_reference` as a weak reference and calling it to obtain the referenced object, we can ensure that the index engine is correctly returned without any NoneType issues.

Ensuring that this corrected `_engine` function is used in the test case provided should result in a passing test, as the AttributeError will no longer be triggered.
