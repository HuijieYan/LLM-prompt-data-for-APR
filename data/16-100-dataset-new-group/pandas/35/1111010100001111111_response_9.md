The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This issue is causing the error raised in the GitHub problem description.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` function. One approach to fixing this bug is to modify the `_engine` function to use a `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to maintain a weak reference to `self` while creating the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to maintain a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is not dropped prematurely, resolving the issue with weakrefs being lost. This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue.
