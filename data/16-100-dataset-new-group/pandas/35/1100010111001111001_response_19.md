The buggy function `_engine` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` seems to be using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The `weakref.ref` is used to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being dereferenced to access the original object.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is returning the weak reference object itself instead of the original object that it references. This will lead to unexpected behavior when using the `_engine` function in other parts of the code.

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before returning it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return period()
```

By dereferencing the weak reference object `period` using `period()`, we are returning the original object that `period` references.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test case pass.
