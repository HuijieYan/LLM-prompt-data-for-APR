The bug in the `_engine` function is likely related to the weak reference implementation. When the `period` is created as a weak reference to `self`, it may not be maintained as intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This results in the failing test and the GitHub issue's reported error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the implementation of the `_engine` function by ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the process of creating the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by modifying the weak reference creation and usage within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

With this corrected implementation, the weak reference to `self` is maintained appropriately, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected `PeriodIndex`.

Once the correction is applied, the failing test should pass, and the GitHub issue's problem should be resolved.
