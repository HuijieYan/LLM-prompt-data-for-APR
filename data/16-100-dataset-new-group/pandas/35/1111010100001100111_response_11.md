The potential error in the buggy function is that the weak reference to the self object is not being properly maintained, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex object is being dropped before it is intended to, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is evident from the GitHub issue description, where the expected output is True, but the function is returning an error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the self object is maintained throughout the lifecycle of the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain the weakref reference to self throughout the function
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))
```
By maintaining the weak reference to the self object throughout the function, the PeriodEngine will receive a valid reference to the PeriodIndex object, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
