In this buggy code, the `_engine` function is using a weak reference to `self` to avoid a reference cycle. However, it returns the result of calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without checking if the weak reference is still valid.

The error message indicates that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object, and the attribute `view` is being called on it, which leads to an `AttributeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the weak reference to `self` is still valid before using it to call `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    if period() is not None:
        return engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        # handle the case where the weak reference is no longer valid
        return None  # or handle the situation according to the specific requirements
```

With this correction, the function will now check if the weak reference to `self` is still valid before using it. If the weak reference is no longer valid, it returns `None` or handles the situation based on the specific requirements.
