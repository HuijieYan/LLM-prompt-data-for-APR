Given the information provided, it seems that the bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute of the PeriodEngine. This is leading to the failing test case and the GitHub issue related to dropping weakly referenced PeriodIndex er.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is maintained and not dropped prematurely, so that the PeriodEngine can access it without any AttributeError.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Creating a strong reference to avoid the weakref being dropped prematurely
    self._period_ref = period
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining a strong reference to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex, we can ensure that it is not dropped prematurely and can be accessed by the PeriodEngine without any issues.

This fix should pass the failing test case and resolve the GitHub issue related to dropping weakly referenced PeriodIndex.
