The buggy function `_engine` is causing an issue when weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` are copied, resulting in the loss of weakrefs.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the weakref creation and its usage to initialize `_engine_type`.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before it's intended to, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until after the `PeriodEngine` is initialized.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

This fix ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is maintained until after the `PeriodEngine` is initialized, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
