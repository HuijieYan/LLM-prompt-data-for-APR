The bug in the provided function is that the weak reference is not being accessed properly. The function is supposed to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` with the length of `self`. However, it seems that the weak reference is being created but not accessed properly.

To fix this bug, we need to access the object being referenced by the weak reference using the `weakref()` function before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly access the weak reference of self before passing it to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.ref(self)()` to access the object being referenced by the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function works as expected.
