Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug is related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should handle the weak reference of `self` properly and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weakref is created using `weakref.proxy(self)` to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

With this correction, the failing test related to the weak reference handling in `PeriodIndex` should be resolved, and the issue reported in GitHub should be addressed as well.
