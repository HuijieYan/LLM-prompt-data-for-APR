To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weakref of the self object is properly maintained and used to avoid a reference cycle.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped before it is intended to be used, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we can update the `_engine` function to maintain the weakref of the `self` object and use it to create the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we store a weak reference to the `self` object in the `period_ref` variable and then use it to create the `PeriodEngine`.

With this fix, the issue reported in the GitHub bug report should be resolved, and the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
