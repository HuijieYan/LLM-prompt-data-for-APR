The bug is likely caused by the `_engine_type` being set to `None`, which leads to the 'NoneType' object error.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` is properly initialized and set to a valid value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_type = SomeValidType  # Replace SomeValidType with the appropriate type for _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Make sure to replace `SomeValidType` with the correct type for `_engine_type`. With this fix, the function should now return a valid `_engine_type` and resolve the 'NoneType' object error.
