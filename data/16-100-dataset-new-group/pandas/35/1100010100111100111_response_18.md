The bug in the provided code is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before it is intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in an AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute of a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we use `period()` instead of `period` when passing the weakref as an argument to `_engine_type`, which ensures that the weak reference is maintained until the argument is used. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function works as expected.

This fix should also address the problem reported in the GitHub issue, and the test case mentioned should now pass without raising an AttributeError.
