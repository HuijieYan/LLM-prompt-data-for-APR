The buggy function in the code above is `_engine(self)`. It uses the `cache_readonly` decorator, which means that this function will be invoked once and then the result is cached. The error message indicates an AttributeError within the `index.pyx` file.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function may be returning a `None` type object, which causes an AttributeError when attempting to access its `view` attribute.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to check why the `_engine_type` method is returning a `None` type object. This could be due to an issue within the `_engine_type` implementation or the weakref usage.
2. The strategy for fixing the bug involves verifying the `_engine_type` method and the `weakref` usage.
3. Another potential fix for the issue is to ensure that the weakref used for the `period` is correctly established and maintained.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_result is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine")
    return engine_result
```
