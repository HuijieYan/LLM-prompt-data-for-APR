The buggy function is `_engine` and it seems to be related to weak referencing of the `self` object. The function is meant to return the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `period` is a weak reference of `self`. The issue on GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it is supposed to.

**Potential error location:** 
The potential error location is with the weak referencing of the `self` object. It's possible that the weak reference is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

**Cause of the bug:** 
The bug appears to be caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:** 
We need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`, and that it is not dropped prematurely.

**Corrected version of the function:**
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return result
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the weak reference `period` is used in the `self._engine_type` and then return the result. This should address the premature dropping of the weak reference and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
