To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being triggered on a 'NoneType' object, which suggests that the weak reference is being lost prematurely.

The correct approach would be to modify the _engine function to properly store and use the weak reference to self. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this corrected implementation, the weak reference to self is maintained until it is used within the _engine_type function, preventing the AttributeError that was occurring in the failing test case.

This correction should resolve the issue and allow the failing test case to pass as expected.
