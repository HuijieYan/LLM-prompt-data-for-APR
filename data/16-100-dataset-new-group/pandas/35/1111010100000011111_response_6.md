## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and then passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This is done to avoid reference cycles. However, it seems that the weak reference is being dropped before it should, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Identified potential error location
The potential error is likely in the usage of `weakref.ref` and how it's being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped earlier than intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is properly used within the `PeriodEngine`. It may involve adjusting the usage of `weakref.ref` or ensuring that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
