The issue in the `_engine` function is that it returns `self._engine_type` without passing `period` and `len(self)` as arguments to it. This causes an attribute error when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to pass `period` and `len(self)` as arguments to `self._engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct result and pass the failing test.
