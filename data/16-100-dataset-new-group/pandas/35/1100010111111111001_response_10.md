The buggy function `_engine` is currently using the `cache_readonly` decorator, which is causing the error. The error message indicates that the `vgetter` method is returning a `NoneType` object, which doesn't have the `view` attribute. This is likely due to the `cache_readonly` decorator not working as intended.

To fix the bug, we can remove the `cache_readonly` decorator from the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
