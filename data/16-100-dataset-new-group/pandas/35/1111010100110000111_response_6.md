The buggy function `_engine` is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute of a `NoneType` object, resulting in a failing test case.

The cause of the bug is related to the weak reference usage within the `_engine` function. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped earlier than intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex` object. This behavior is leading to the AttributeError when trying to access attributes of the `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object should be retained for as long as the `PeriodEngine` requires it. This can be achieved by modifying the weak reference usage within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `weakref.proxy(self)` is used to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, ensuring that it is kept alive until the `PeriodEngine` no longer requires it. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
