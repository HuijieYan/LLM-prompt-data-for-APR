## Fixing the bug
The buggy function `_engine` should return an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object. However, the current implementation returns an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a normal reference to the PeriodIndex object, which can cause a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to return `_engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))` instead of `_engine_type(period, len(self))`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
