The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle but is failing to properly pass the weak reference to `_engine_type`. This is causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

Given the runtime input and output values, it seems that the `_engine` function is not correctly passing the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should properly pass the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. Additionally, the weakref module should be imported to correctly use weak references.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import weakref

...
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By ensuring that the weak reference `period` is properly passed to `_engine_type`, the bug should be resolved and the failing test should pass.
