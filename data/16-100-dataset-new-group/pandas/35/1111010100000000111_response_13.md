## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` method that is supposed to return an engine type for the `PeriodIndex` class. It uses a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but there seems to be an issue with the weak reference not correctly pointing to the `PeriodIndex`.

## Identifying potential error locations:
The potential error locations in the `_engine` function could be the weak reference creation and its usage to initialize the engine type.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This can lead to errors when using the engine with the weak reference.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is created and used correctly within the `_engine` function. This might involve revisiting the weakref implementation and how it interacts with the engine type initialization.

## Bug-fixed version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weakref.proxy() instead of weakref.ref() to create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the bug-fixed version, the `weakref.proxy()` function is used to create a weak reference to `self` instead of `weakref.ref()`. This ensures that the weak reference is correctly retained and used when initializing the engine type. This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and prevent the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` from being dropped prematurely.
