## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error location is within the `_engine` function, where it is trying to return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to `self`, but it is not handling the case where the weak reference has been dropped prematurely.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object within the `_engine` function. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, resulting in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute of the `NoneType`.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should handle the case where the weak reference has been prematurely dropped, and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other code)

    # the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine is None:
            raise Exception("Failed to create engine")  # Or handle the failure appropriately
        return engine
```
