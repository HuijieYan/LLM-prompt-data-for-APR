#### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that it is intended to be a read-only cached property. The function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, and then passing that weak reference to `_engine_type`. 

#### Issue
The `weakref.ref` should be used to create a weak reference and then that reference should be accessed using the `()` method which returns the original object, but instead it is directly passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`. This will likely result in unexpected behavior when `_engine_type` tries to use the weak reference.

#### Fix
The bug can be fixed by using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference, and then accessing the original object using the `()` method before passing it to `_engine_type`. 

### Corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
