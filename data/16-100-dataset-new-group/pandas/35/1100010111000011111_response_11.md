The buggy function `_engine` is failing to properly create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This results in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a proper weak reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(period), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of passing just `period` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test case.
