The `PeriodIndex._engine` function is causing an AttributeError when accessed by the failing test `pandas` due to the fact that the return value of the `_engine_type` method is set to `None`, rather than the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

The bug occurs in the `_engine` function in the `pandas` package, in the file `period.py`. The function is defined as `@cache_readonly` and attempts to create an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to `self` as an argument. The problem arises when `self._engine_type` is called with invalid arguments or returns `None`.

To fix this bug, modify the `_engine` function to handle the return value of `_engine_type` correctly, ensuring that a valid `PeriodEngine` object is returned. 

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function that should address the bug:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create a PeriodEngine")
```
