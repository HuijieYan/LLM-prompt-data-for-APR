The buggy function is a method in the period.py file of the pandas library. The function is using a decorator called cache_readonly, which is likely intended to cache the return value of the _engine function.

The potential error in the code is that the weakref.ref() is not being used properly. The weakref.ref() function creates a weak reference to the object, but it does not return the actual object. Instead, it returns a weak reference object which should be dereferenced in order to get the actual object.

The cause of the bug is that the weakref.ref(self) should be dereferenced to obtain the actual object before passing it to the _engine_type function.

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to the _engine_type function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
