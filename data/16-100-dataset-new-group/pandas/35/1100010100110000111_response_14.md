## Analysis
The bug is caused by the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This causes the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute on a NoneType object.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the _engine function where a weakref of self is passed to _engine_type.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, allowing the PeriodEngine to receive the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    def _engine_type(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    
    return _engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weakref of self is maintained until it is passed to _engine_type, preventing the premature dropping of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex and resolving the bug.
