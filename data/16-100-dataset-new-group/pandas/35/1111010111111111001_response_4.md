The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the weak reference usage. When creating a weak reference `period`, the reference might not be maintained during the function's lifetime, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access its methods or attributes.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to avoid using weak references altogether and directly use the `self` reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, we ensure that the `self` reference remains valid and accessible throughout the function's execution.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
