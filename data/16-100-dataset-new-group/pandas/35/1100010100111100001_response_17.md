The bug in the provided function is likely due to the use of weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to the self object. The weak reference is not being handled correctly when used in self._engine_type().

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference is properly handled and utilized. We can do this by modifying the _engine function to use the weak reference to create a strong reference before passing it to self._engine_type(). 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the correct file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference from weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference is turned into a strong reference using `weakref.ref(self)()` before being passed to self._engine_type(). This should resolve the AttributeError issue and the function should pass the failing test.
