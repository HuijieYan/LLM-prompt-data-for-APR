The potential error in the buggy function is that weakly referenced 'period' is passed to `_engine_type`. This could lead to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex, causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, a potential strategy is to ensure that the weakly referenced 'period' is not dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine does not receive a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), copy=False)
```

In the corrected version, the copy parameter is set to False when constructing the PeriodEngine, ensuring that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function works as expected, passing the failing test case.
