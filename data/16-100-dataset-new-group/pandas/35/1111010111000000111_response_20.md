The issue seems to be related to weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function `_engine` creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, but it seems that the weak reference is dropped before it should be.

The bug is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the failure of the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` which expects `all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` to return `True`.

To fix this bug, we should make sure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained for as long as needed and that it is not dropped prematurely. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function to use a different approach for creating and maintaining the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # Use a lambda function to create a weak reference to self
    period_ref = lambda: self
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By using a lambda function to create the weak reference, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained as long as needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass as expected.
