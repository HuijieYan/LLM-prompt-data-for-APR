The cause of the bug is likely the incorrect implementation of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the `_engine` function is returning a `None` object instead of the expected type.

The `_engine` function is using `cache_readonly` decorator, which is used to cache expensive attribute creation by setting the attribute directly on the instance. However, it seems that the caching might not be working as expected in this case, leading to the function returning `None`. This could be due to a mismatch in the use of `cache_readonly` in the function.

To fix the bug, the caching strategy needs to be revisited and potentially adjusted to ensure that the returned value is correctly cached and retrieved.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```
In the corrected version, we directly assign the result of `_engine_type` to a variable `engine` and return it after the weak reference is created. This should fix the caching issue and ensure that the correct object is returned by the `_engine` function.
