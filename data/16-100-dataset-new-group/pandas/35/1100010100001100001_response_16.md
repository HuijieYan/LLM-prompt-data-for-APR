The bug in the given function is likely to be due to the incorrect usage of weakref.ref(). It is used to create a weak reference to the object, but it is not being used correctly here.

The correct usage of weakref.ref() should be to create a weak reference to an object and then access it using the .() notation to obtain the actual object. In this case, the weak reference should be created for the 'self' object and then accessed to pass it to _engine_type.

Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters, the correct fix for the buggy function could look like this:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
