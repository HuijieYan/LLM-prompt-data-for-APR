The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This occurs due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the AttributeError: `'NoneType'` object has no attribute `'view'`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, allowing the `PeriodEngine` to receive the correct reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Check if the weakly referenced period object is still alive
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        # If the weakly referenced period object is no longer alive, raise an error
        raise RuntimeError("Weakly referenced period object has been collected")
```

By checking if the weakly referenced period object is still alive before passing it to the `_engine_type`, we can ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` and prevent the `NoneType` object attribute error from occurring.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
