The buggy function `_engine` is causing an error in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. The error message indicates an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the expected values and types, it is clear that the weak reference to `self` as `period` is not being properly utilized in the `_engine` function, leading to a NoneType object being passed on to the PeriodEngine.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly utilized and retained within the `_engine` function without being dropped prematurely.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.base import IndexEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return IndexEngine(weak_period, len(self))
```

By using the IndexEngine and ensuring the proper handling of weak references, we can fix the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes.

This fix will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" as it addresses the problem of weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely.
