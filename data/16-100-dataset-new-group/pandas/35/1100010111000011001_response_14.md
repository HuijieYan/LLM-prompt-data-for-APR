### Analysis
The `_engine` function is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, which suggests that it should return a cached value and possibly only calculate it once.

The function creates a weak reference to `self` and then uses it to instantiate a new object of the type `_engine_type`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a multi-index from an array of Periods and then checks if all levels are monotonic.

### Bug
The bug seems to be in the caching mechanism of the `_engine` function. Since it doesn't have any conditional logic based on the cached value, it seems that it's not correctly caching the result.

### Fix
The caching logic should be implemented to only calculate and return the cached value once. If the cached value is available, it should be returned. If it's not available, then the function should calculate the value, store it, and return it.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

_cached_engine = {}

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if self in _cached_engine:
        return _cached_engine[self]
    else:
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        _cached_engine[self] = result
        return result
```
