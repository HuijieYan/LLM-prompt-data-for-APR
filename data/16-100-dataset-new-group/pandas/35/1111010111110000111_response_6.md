To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped before intended so that the PeriodEngine does not receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

Explanation:
- The issue originates from the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.
- The corrected version ensures that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is properly passed to the _engine_type, preventing premature dropping and resolving the issue.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
