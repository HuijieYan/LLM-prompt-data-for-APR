The bug in the _engine function lies in the use of weakref.ref(). When weakref.ref() is called, it returns a weak reference object that does not hold a strong reference to the original object. In the buggy function, 'period' only holds a weak reference to 'self', so when 'self' goes out of scope, 'period' will return None.

To fix this bug, we need to maintain a strong reference to 'self' within the _engine function. One way to do this is by using a simple assignment, which will keep a strong reference to 'self' within the _engine function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a strong reference to self.
    self_ref = self
    return self._engine_type(self_ref, len(self))
```

With this fix, the _engine function will maintain a strong reference to 'self', preventing it from being prematurely garbage collected. This will ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped before intended, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
