The issue is caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped before intended.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Please note that this fix assumes that the `_engine_type` function correctly handles the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`. If not, the fix may need to be implemented in that function instead.
