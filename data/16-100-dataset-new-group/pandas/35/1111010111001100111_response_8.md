The issue in the buggy function is that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before the engine is intended to use it, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` has finished using it.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class WeakRefPeriodEngine(PeriodEngine):
        def __init__(self, period_ref, length):
            self.period_ref = period_ref
            super().__init__(length)
            
        def method_using_period_index(self):
            period_index = period_ref()
            # use the period_index

    return WeakRefPeriodEngine(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we have created a nested class `WeakRefPeriodEngine` inside the `_engine` function. This class takes a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` as a parameter and uses it to access the `PeriodIndex` when needed. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained until the engine is done using it.

This fix should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub and ensure that the failing test passes.
