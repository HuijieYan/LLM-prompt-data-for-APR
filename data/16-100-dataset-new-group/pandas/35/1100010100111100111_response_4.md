Based on the error message and the runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function, the cause of the bug is that the `period` variable, which is supposed to be a weak reference to `self`, is not being properly passed to `_engine_type`. This results in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' when `idx2.levels` is accessed in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by using the `weakref.proxy` function to create a weak reference that behaves like the original object instead of just a weak reference object.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` will behave like the original object and will be properly passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
