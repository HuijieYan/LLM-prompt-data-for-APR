The problem with the provided code is that the `_engine` function is not correctly handling the weak reference, leading to potential None values being passed to the engine. This results in the failing test, as the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before its intended use.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is handled properly within the `_engine` function. We should also consider the discussion in the GitHub issue, where it is mentioned that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before its intended use.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

In this corrected version, we check if the weak reference 'period' is not None before passing it to the `_engine_type`. If it is None, we return None, ensuring that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
