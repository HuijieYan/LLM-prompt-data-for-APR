The bug in the `_engine` function is that it's returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly handling the weak reference to `self`, which leads to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended. This results in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing a failure in the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods()`. 

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period` is now called as a function `period()`, which retrieves the referenced object, instead of just providing a weak reference. This ensures that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to `self`, resolving the weak reference issue and fixing the bug.

With this fix, the failing test case should now pass, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
