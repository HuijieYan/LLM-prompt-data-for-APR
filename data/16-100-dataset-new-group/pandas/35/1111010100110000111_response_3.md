The buggy function `_engine` in the PeriodIndex class has an issue where it returns `None` instead of the expected `_engine_type`. This causes the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail with the error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

The cause of the bug is that the `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function does not properly reference the `PeriodIndex` instance, leading to it being dropped prematurely.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should ensure that the weak reference is properly held until the engine is constructed and returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Hold a weak reference to self until the engine is constructed
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

With this fix, the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the `_engine` is constructed, ensuring that the PeriodIndex instance is not dropped prematurely.
