The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error in the failing test. The `weakref.ref` method is not being used correctly, leading to the dropped weak reference for the `PeriodIndex`, resulting in the `NoneType` error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference for the `PeriodIndex` is properly maintained and used to create the `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

By ensuring that the weak reference `period` is used when creating the `_engine_type` and passing the correct length of `self._values`, we address the bug and ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.

This fix will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test passes without the AttributeError.
