## The bug
The bug is occurring in the `_engine` function of the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the return value of the `_engine` function is a NoneType object, causing the subsequent error.

The expected output is that when using `idx2` to get the levels of the MultiIndex, all values should be monotonic, but currently, it's raising an error due to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function so that it does not result in a NoneType object. Updating the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function should resolve the issue.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self) if self is not None else 0)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `self` being not None, and if it is not None, we pass `len(self)` to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained, resolving the issue of receiving a NoneType object. This correction should address the problem described in the GitHub issue and fix the bug.
