Based on the information provided, the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be related to weak references being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the strategy would be to modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` and ensure that it does not get dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by using weak reference proxies and checking for the existence of the original referenced object before using it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period_proxy = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_proxy, len(self)) if period_proxy() is not None else None
```

By using a weak reference proxy and checking for the existence of the original referenced object before using it, the bug in the `_engine` function should be fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
