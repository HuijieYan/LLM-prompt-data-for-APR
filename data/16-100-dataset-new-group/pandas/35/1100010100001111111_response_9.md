The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the issue is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is leading to the bug where the `is_monotonic` check is failing.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained until it is no longer needed. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference in a variable within the function so that it persists until the end of the function's execution.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `period_ref` variable, we ensure that it remains valid until the return statement, thus resolving the issue and producing the expected output.
