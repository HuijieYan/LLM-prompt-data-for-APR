To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, it is necessary to ensure that the weak reference to self is properly maintained and not dropped prematurely.

The bug is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the view method on a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be maintained until it is no longer needed. One way to achieve this is by using a named reference to hold the weak reference. This can be done by storing the weak reference to `self` in a variable within the function scope. Additionally, checking for the validity of the weak reference before using it can help prevent the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_weakref()
    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self is no longer valid.")
```

By maintaining the weak reference to `self` and checking its validity before using it, the corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
