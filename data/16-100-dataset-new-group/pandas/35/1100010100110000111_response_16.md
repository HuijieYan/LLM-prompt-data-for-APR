## Identification of potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The weakref.ref() function is used to create a weak reference to the self object, which may lead to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex, resulting in the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the weak reference to the self object should be handled in a way that ensures it is not dropped prematurely, so that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self to prevent it from being dropped prematurely
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
