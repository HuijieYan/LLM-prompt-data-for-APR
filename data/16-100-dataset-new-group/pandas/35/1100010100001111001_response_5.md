## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

The cause of the bug is that the `weakref.ref` function is being used on `self` instead of `self._values`, which results in an incorrect reference to the PeriodIndex object. The corrected version of the function uses `self` directly as the first argument to `_engine_type` and the length of `self` as the second argument, which matches the expected values and types of the input parameters.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to use `self` directly as the first argument to `_engine_type` and the length of `self` as the second argument.

The corrected version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
