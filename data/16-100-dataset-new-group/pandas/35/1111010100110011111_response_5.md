To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we can modify the implementation to avoid the NoneType error that is currently occurring. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if self._engine_type is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type is not defined")
```

In the corrected version:
- We first check if the `_engine_type` attribute is not None before creating an instance of the engine.
- If `_engine_type` is None, we raise a ValueError indicating that it is not defined.

This fix will prevent the AttributeError caused by the NoneType and allow the function to return the correct instance of the engine when it is defined. This should resolve the issue reported for the PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex losing weakrefs.
