The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to improper reference handling with weakref, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access the view attribute of a reference.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` needs to be properly handled in the `_engine` function. Modify the function to ensure that the weakref doesn't return a `NoneType`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` ensures that the weak reference doesn't evaluate to `NoneType`. This should resolve the attribute error mentioned in the failing test.

By making this change, the corrected `_engine` function should now handle weak references properly and fix the failing test.
