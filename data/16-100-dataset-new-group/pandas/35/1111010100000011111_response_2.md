To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the function's execution. Based on the GitHub issue, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it should be.

One approach to fixing the bug is to store the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` object itself, and then use that weak reference when creating the `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other class definitions)

    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, month=None, quarter=None, day=None,
                 hour=None, minute=None, second=None, tz=None, dtype=None):
        # ... (other initialization code)
        self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)  # store a weak reference to self

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass the stored weakref to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` object, we ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the function's execution and is accessible when creating the `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
