Based on the error message and the runtime values and types of the input parameters, the bug in the _engine function seems to be related to the PeriodEngine not being properly initialized. It appears that the PeriodEngine is returning a NoneType object, which is leading to the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error when the view method is called on it.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the PeriodEngine is properly initialized and that it returns a valid object instead of NoneType.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    while engine is None:
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

In the corrected version, we are ensuring that the PeriodEngine is not NoneType by checking the return value and trying again if it is None until a valid object is returned. This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test will pass.
