#### Expected case 1
- Input:
  - self: PeriodIndex object
- Output:
  - A weak reference to the PeriodIndex object created within the _engine function.
  
### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `weakref.ref` function. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference to the object passed to it, but it does not create a weak reference to the object within the function and return it. Therefore, the current implementation of the `_engine` function does not correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object and return it as expected.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object and return it.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return period
```
