The potential error in the buggy function occurs when `self._engine_type` is called. It seems that the `period` argument being passed as a weak reference to `_engine_type` is not being handled correctly within the `_engine_type` method.

The failing test occurs when trying to assert the monotonicity of the levels in `idx2`. It fails due to an AttributeError in the `_do_monotonic_check` method of the `PeriodEngine` class, where a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the weak reference `period` not being handled correctly within the `_engine_type` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, resulting in a 'NoneType' being used instead of the expected value.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly handled and resolved within the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Resolve the weak reference before passing it to _engine_type
    resolved_period = period()
    return self._engine_type(resolved_period, len(self))
```

By resolving the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the correct reference is used within the `_engine_type` method. This should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
