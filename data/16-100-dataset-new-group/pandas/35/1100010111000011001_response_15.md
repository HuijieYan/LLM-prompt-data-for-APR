### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using the decorator `@cache_readonly` to cache the value of the `_engine` function after its first execution. The bug arises from the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to self, which is not correct and leads to the buggy behavior as observed in the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The `weakref.ref()` creates a weak reference to an object, but it returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. This leads to an incorrect input being passed to `self._engine_type()`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref()` should be called on `self` before passing it to the `_engine_type`. This will correctly create a weak reference to the object and ensure there is no reference cycle.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
from pandas import Period, PeriodIndex

# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
