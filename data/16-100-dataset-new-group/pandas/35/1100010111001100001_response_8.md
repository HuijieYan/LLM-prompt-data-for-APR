The bug in the `@cache_readonly` decorator is caused by the function not properly returning the expected output. The `weakref.ref` is used to create a weak reference to the `self` object to avoid a reference cycle, but it is not being properly used in the `self._engine_type` call.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly use the weak reference created by `weakref.ref` when calling `self._engine_type`. We can achieve this by dereferencing the weak reference using the `weakref` module's `dereference` function before passing it to `self._engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref.dereference(period), len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test should now pass as the bug causing the test to fail has been fixed.
