Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self is not None else None
```

The issue with the original function is that it did not check if `self` is None before returning the `_engine_type`. This caused a NoneType error when trying to access the `view` attribute of a NoneType object.

The corrected version checks if `self` is None, and if so, it returns None. This should prevent the NoneType error and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
