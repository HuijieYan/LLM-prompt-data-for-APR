The bug in the provided function `_engine` is likely due to a NoneType object being returned and then an attempt to call the `view` method on it.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine_type` method is returning a NoneType object instead of the expected result, which leads to the AttributeError when trying to call the `view` method on it.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns the correct type of object, and that it does not return None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine_result is not None:
        return engine_result
    else:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("The _engine_type method returned None.")
```

By checking for the NoneType object and raising a ValueError in that case, we ensure that the `_engine` function does not return a NoneType object, and instead handles the error condition appropriately.
