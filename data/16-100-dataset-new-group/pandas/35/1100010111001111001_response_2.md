The issue with the buggy function `_engine` is that it is using a weak reference to self, but then immediately passing it to `_engine_type` without properly dereferencing it. This could potentially cause unexpected behavior and lead to the failing test.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `_engine` function to properly dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by using the `self` attribute of the weak reference object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of just `period`, we are properly dereferencing the weak reference and passing the actual object to `_engine_type`. This should fix the issue and make the test pass.

This corrected version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
