The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError when accessing `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`. This is happening because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained, preventing the AttributeError when accessing the `PeriodEngine`.
