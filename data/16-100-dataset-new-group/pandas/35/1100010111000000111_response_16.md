The potential error in the buggy function is that the weak reference to "self" (period = weakref.ref(self)) is not being handled properly, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

The bug is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to raise an error when checking for monotonicity of the levels in the returned MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to "self" is handled correctly in order for the PeriodEngine to receive the PeriodIndex as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:  # Check if the weak reference is still valid
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    else:
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the weak reference "period" is still valid using `period() is not None`. If the weak reference is valid, we pass its value to `_engine_type`. If it's not valid, we pass "self" directly to `_engine_type`.

This should resolve the issue of the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
