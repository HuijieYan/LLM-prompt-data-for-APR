The bug in the `_engine` function is that it returns the result of calling the `_engine_type` constructor with the `period` weak reference and the length of the `PeriodIndex` object `self`. This is incorrect because the `_engine_type` constructor should instead be called with the actual `PeriodIndex` object `self` and its length.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to correctly call the `_engine_type` constructor with the `PeriodIndex` object `self` and its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
