The function `_engine` should return an instance of `PeriodEngine` initialized with a weak reference to `self` and the length of the PeriodIndex.

The error occurs because the `_engine` function is trying to access an attribute of `self` after creating a weak reference, which results in a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to use the weak reference when needed, and to fetch the actual object when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
