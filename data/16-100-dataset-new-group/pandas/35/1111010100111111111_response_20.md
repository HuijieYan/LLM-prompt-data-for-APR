## Bug fix strategy
The bug is likely occurring due to the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

In the provided buggy function, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is created with `period = weakref.ref(self)`. However, the weak reference is not being accessed or utilized in a manner that ensures its longevity.

To resolve this issue, we should modify the usage of the weak reference to ensure that it is properly utilized and maintained until the `PeriodEngine` no longer needs it.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    ...
    """


    # this is the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Maintain the weak reference to self until it's no longer needed by the PeriodEngine
        period_reference = weakref.ref(self)
        engine_type = self._engine_type(period_reference, len(self))
        return engine_type
```

By making the above changes, the corrected function should resolve the premature dropping of the weak reference and ensure that it is available when needed by the `PeriodEngine`, consequently resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
