The provided function `_engine` is a decorator function with the `@cache_readonly` decorator. The function is designed to return a value based on the weak reference of `self`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `MultiIndex` and checking if all the levels are monotonic. The failing assertion error occurs in the `is_monotonic` method of the `MultiIndex` class due to an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object.

The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing the weak reference to not be properly created or utilized, resulting in a `NoneType` object at a later stage, leading to the `AttributeError`.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the weak reference is properly created and used to avoid a reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

In the corrected version, the method `self._engine_type` is called with the weak reference object `period` and the length of `self`, and the result is immediately invoked using `()`. This ensures that the correct value is returned, preventing the `NoneType` object error.
