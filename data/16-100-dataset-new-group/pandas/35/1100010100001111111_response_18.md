## Explanation
The bug seems to be related to the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex objects. The `_engine` function is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type`, which is a weak reference to the PeriodIndex. However, it is not passing the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, causing it to receive `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a weak reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type` instead of just `self`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
