The bug in the given function is likely causing an AttributeError due to calling the `view` method on a `NoneType` object. This indicates that the `_engine_type` function is returning `None` instead of the expected type.

The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`, presumably to avoid a reference cycle. However, the return value from `_engine_type` is not being handled correctly, resulting in a `None` object being returned.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the return value from `_engine_type` is properly handled and that it is not returning `None`. We should also verify that the weak reference is being used correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_result is not None:
        return engine_result
    else:
        # Handle the case when _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine")
```

In this corrected version, we check if the result from `_engine_type` is `None`, and if so, we raise a `ValueError` to indicate that the engine creation failed. This ensures that the function does not return a `NoneType` object, which was causing the AttributeError.
