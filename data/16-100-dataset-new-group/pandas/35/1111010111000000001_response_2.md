The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to use weak reference to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` should be changed to `period = weakref.ref(self, self._engine_type)`. This is because the `self` argument is not being used properly as the first argument to the `weakref.ref` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self, self._engine_type)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The corrected function should now properly create a weak reference to the `self` instance and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
