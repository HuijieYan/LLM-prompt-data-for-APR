The cause of the bug is that the `_engine_type` attribute is not being properly initialized in the `PeriodIndex` class. This leads to a `NoneType` object being returned, causing an `AttributeError` when the `view("i8")` method is called on it.

To fix the bug, we need to properly initialize the `_engine_type` attribute in the `PeriodIndex` class so that it returns a valid object without being `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Initialize _engine_type properly to return a valid object
    if self._values is not None:
        return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")
```

By adding a condition to check if `self._values` is not None, we ensure that the `_engine_type` is initialized properly and returns a valid object.

With this fix, the failing test should now pass without throwing an `AttributeError`.
