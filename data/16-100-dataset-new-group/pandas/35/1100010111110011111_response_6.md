To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not lost prematurely. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period)
```

By removing the `len(self)` argument from the `_engine_type` function, we prevent the premature loss of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, which was causing the `NoneType` error.

With this modification, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values while resolving the GitHub issue.
