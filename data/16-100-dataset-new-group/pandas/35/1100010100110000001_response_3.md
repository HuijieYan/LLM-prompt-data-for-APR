The error message indicates that the function `is_monotonic_increasing` is unable to retrieve the correct value due to an `AttributeError`. This suggests that the issue is related to the `_engine` method in the `pandas.core.indexes.period` file.

The buggy part of the code is the `_engine` method, which is supposed to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycles. However, the weak reference is not being used correctly, leading to the attribute error.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being used when calling `_engine_type`, resulting in a `NoneType` object error when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly utilized when calling `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(ref, len(self))
```

By using `ref` as a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly utilized, thereby fixing the bug and addressing the attribute error.
