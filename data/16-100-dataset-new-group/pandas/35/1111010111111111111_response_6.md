## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By removing the reference to `period` in the `PeriodIndex` class `_engine` function, we can ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled and the `PeriodEngine` will receive the expected `PeriodIndex` object. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass while also satisfying the expected input/output values.
