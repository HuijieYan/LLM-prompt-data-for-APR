The bug in the function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This issue is causing errors when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to properly handle the weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
This fixed version resolves the issue by correctly creating a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained for the duration that it is needed by the `PeriodEngine`.
