The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used in the subsequent call to `self._engine_type`. This is causing the weak reference to be dropped before it's intended, leading to the PeriodEngine getting a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

In order to fix this bug, we need to make sure that the weak reference is correctly used when calling `self._engine_type`. We can achieve this by passing the weak reference object as an argument, and then accessing the original object within the `_engine_type` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we're passing the weak reference object `period` to `self._engine_type`, and then calling `period()` to access the original `self` object within the `_engine_type` function. This ensures that the weak reference is correctly used and prevents it from being dropped prematurely.
