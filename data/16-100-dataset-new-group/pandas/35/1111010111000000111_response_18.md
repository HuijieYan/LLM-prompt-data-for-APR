The buggy function `_engine` is causing a weak reference issue in the `PeriodIndex` class, particularly when used with `MultiIndex`. The `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test fails when trying to get level values from a `PeriodIndex` within a `MultiIndex`.

The cause of the bug appears to be in the `_engine` function, where it uses a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to a situation where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to properly maintain the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly maintain the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object using lambda
    period = weakref.ref(self, lambda _: None)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object will be maintained and the issue described in the GitHub bug report will be resolved. This should also make the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass successfully.
