The issue in the buggy function is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the `_engine` function and is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function that maintains the weak reference:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self._weakref)
```

Additionally, we need to add a weak reference attribute `_weakref` to the `PeriodIndex` class. Here's an example of how it can be added:

```python
class PeriodIndex(Index):
    def __new__(cls, data, copy=True, name=None, **kwargs):
        if isinstance(data, (ABCPeriodIndex, ABCIndexClass)):
            return data.__copy__(copy)
        elif is_list_like(data):
            from pandas import Series

            data = com._asarray_tuplesafe(data)
            return Index(data, name=name, dtype='period')

        try:
            _weakref = weakref.ref(data)
        except TypeError:
            _weakref = None

        return Index(data, name=name, dtype='period', **kwargs, _weakref=_weakref)
```

By maintaining the weak reference throughout the `_engine` function and ensuring that the weak reference attribute is added to the `PeriodIndex` class, we fix the bug and it should pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
