### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using a `weakref` to prevent a reference cycle, but it is not being used correctly. This is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the `weakref.ref` is not being used to create a weak reference to `self`. Instead, it is just creating a reference to `self`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref` should be used to create a weak reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected version, the `weakref.proxy` is used to create a weak reference to `self` instead of `weakref.ref`. This should prevent the reference cycle and fix the bug.
