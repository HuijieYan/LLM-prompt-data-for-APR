The buggy function is the `_engine` function, which is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator.

The potential error location is on the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, where the weak reference to self is not being used correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being properly utilized within the `_engine` function, which can lead to potential reference cycle issues.

To fix the bug, we need to properly use the weak reference to self within the `_engine` function and handle any potential reference cycle issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In this corrected version, the weak reference `period` is properly used within the `_engine` function. However, it's important to note that handling reference cycles properly might require modifications in other parts of the code as well.
