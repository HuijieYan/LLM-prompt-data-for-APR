### The cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the use of weakref.ref to create a weak reference to self, which is intended to avoid a reference cycle. However, the reference to self is being dropped before its intended time, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in the unexpected behavior observed in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is not dropped prematurely and is still valid when used in the PeriodEngine. This may involve modifying how the weak reference is created or stored.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self and store it as an attribute to prevent premature dropping
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are storing the weak reference to self as an attribute of the object to prevent it from being dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives a valid reference to the PeriodIndex.
