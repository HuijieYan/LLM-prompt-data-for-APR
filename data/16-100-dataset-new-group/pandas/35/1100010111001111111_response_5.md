The buggy function `_engine` is using the `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then passing that to `_engine_type` method. However, the bug seems to be related to the weak reference being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not being maintained properly, leading to it being dropped prematurely. This is resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, causing the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed, so that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are immediately invoking the weak reference `period()` to ensure that it remains valid until it is no longer needed. This should fix the issue and make the failing test case pass.
