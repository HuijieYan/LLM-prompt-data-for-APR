To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, it seems that the weak reference to `self` is not being properly maintained, leading to the `_engine_type` function receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The root cause of the bug seems to be related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object. Weak referencing allows the object to be garbage collected if there are no strong references to it, which can cause the `_engine_type` function to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This occurs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, resulting in the weak reference being dropped before it's intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference to `self` using a lambda function, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` object is not garbage collected prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period_ref(), len(self))
```
In this corrected version, we use a lambda function to capture the weak reference and ensure that it can still be accessed by the `_engine_type` function when needed.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained properly.
