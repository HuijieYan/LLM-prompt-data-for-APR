The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test. The error occurs when the `is_monotonic` property is accessed in the `idx2` MultiIndex object.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not being properly passed to `_engine_type`, leading to the engine receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly pass a weak reference to `self` to the `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```
In this corrected version, we added a check to see if `_engine_type` is not `None` before calling it with the weak reference to `self`. This ensures that the engine will receive the proper reference to `self`, preventing the AttributeError in the test.

By making this change, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
