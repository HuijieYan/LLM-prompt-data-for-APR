The issue with the buggy function is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it is intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

By maintaining the weak reference to 'self' until it is passed to '_engine_type', we ensure that the reference to PeriodIndex is maintained and that the bug identified in the GitHub issue is resolved.

With this corrected function, the failing test in the test case 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' should pass and the issue described in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
