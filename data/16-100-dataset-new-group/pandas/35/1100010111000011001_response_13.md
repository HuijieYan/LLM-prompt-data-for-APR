The provided buggy function uses the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which is intended to cache the result of the function after the first call. However, the function itself does not appear to have any parameters explicitly passed to it, so it is unclear what the intended behavior is.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` and attempts to retrieve the level values from it. It is not directly related to the `_engine` function, so it's unclear why the function is failing based on this test.

Based on the provided code and test, it seems that the `_engine` function is intended to return an instance of a certain class (`_engine_type`) using a weak reference to `self` (the current object). However, the function appears to be missing some necessary parameters, and it is unclear what `_engine_type` is or where it is defined.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to be modified to properly accept the required parameters and accurately return an instance of `self._engine_type`. Additionally, the test appears to be unrelated to the function and should be modified to test the actual behavior of the `_engine` function.

Given the limitations of understanding the entire context and implementation details, the following is a hypothetical corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self, engine_type, length):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return engine_type(period, length)
```

In this corrected version, the `_engine` function is modified to accept `engine_type` and `length` as parameters, which are used to create an instance of `engine_type` with the weak reference `period` and the specified length. This assumes that `engine_type` is a valid and accessible class for instantiation.

It's important to note that this fix is speculative and may not fully address the underlying issues without a complete understanding of the surrounding code and dependencies.
