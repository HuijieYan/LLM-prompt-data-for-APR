The `cache_readonly` decorator is applied to the `_engine` method, which means that the method will only be evaluated once and then cached. However, the use of `weakref.ref(self)` inside the method seems to be causing an issue when the method is cached and called beyond the first evaluation.

The error message indicates that the `_engine` method of `PeriodEngine` is returning a `NoneType` object, which does not have the `view` attribute. This means that the `_engine` attribute is not being properly set during the first evaluation of the `_engine` method, leading to it being a `None` object.

A potential strategy for fixing this bug is to remove the use of weak references and ensure that the `_engine` attribute is properly set when the `_engine` method is initially called.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine'):
        self._engine = self._engine_type(self, len(self))
    return self._engine
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `_engine` attribute is already set. If it's not set, we then initialize it using `self._engine_type(self, len(self))`. This ensures that the `_engine` attribute is properly set during the first evaluation of the `_engine` method and subsequently returned without being affected by weak references.

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_engine` method should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
