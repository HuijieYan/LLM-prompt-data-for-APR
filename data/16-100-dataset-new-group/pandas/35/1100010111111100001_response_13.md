The issue in the buggy function is that it's returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object. This causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute of the `NoneType` object in the failing test.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function is returning the correct `PeriodEngine` object instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._engine_type()
```

With this fix, the function will return the `PeriodEngine` object instead of `None`, resolving the `AttributeError` in the failing test.
