The bug in the `_engine` function causes an AttributeError when attempting to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object. This is due to the use of weak references in the `_engine` function which may lead to a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to not use weak references, or to handle weak references properly to avoid the AttributeError when accessing attributes of a weakly referenced object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By removing the weak reference and directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, the bug should be fixed and the function should pass the failing test without causing the AttributeError.
