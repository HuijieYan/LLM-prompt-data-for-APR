#### Explanation
The buggy function is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which means it is expected to store the result of the function in the cache and return the cached result on subsequent calls.

The bug in the function is that it is trying to create a weak reference to `self`, but is not using it correctly when instantiating `_engine_type`. This may cause a reference cycle and memory leaks.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to use the weak reference correctly and ensure that it is used to instantiate `_engine_type` instead of a direct reference to `self`.

#### The corrected version

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
