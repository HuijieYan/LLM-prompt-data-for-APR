Given the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to weak references being lost before intended, leading to a `NoneType` error in the `PeriodEngine` class. This results in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function needs to properly handle weak references and ensure that the PeriodIndex is not dropped before intended. One potential strategy to fix the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to explicitly use the weak reference when passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This will ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled and used within the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)`, we explicitly create a weak reference to the `self` object and ensure that it is properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

This corrected version should resolve the weak reference issue and ensure that the failing test for the `is_monotonic` property passes, addressing the GitHub issue as well.
