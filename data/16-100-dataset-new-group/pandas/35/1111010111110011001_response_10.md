#### The expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
The function should return an instance of `PeriodEngine` with the correct attributes and methods based on the input `self` variable, satisfying the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute check in the failing test.

### Expected case 2
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
self, len(self) 

#### The expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
The function should return an instance of `PeriodEngine` with the correct attributes and methods based on the input `self` variable and the length of `self`, satisfying the `view("i8")` method call in the failing test.

### Expected case 3
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
self, len(self) 

#### The expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
The function should return an instance of `PeriodEngine` with the correct attributes and methods based on the input `self` variable and the length of `self`, satisfying the attribute and method calls in the failing test.

### Expected case 4
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
self, len(self) 

#### The expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
The function should return an instance of `PeriodEngine` with the correct attributes and methods based on the input `self` variable and the length of `self`, satisfying the expected behavior of the `PeriodIndex` class.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug is likely due to the `_engine_type` not returning the expected `PeriodEngine` instance, resulting in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` method. To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the `_engine_type` returns the correct `PeriodEngine` instance with the required attributes and methods.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```
