This problem is causing an AttributeError to raise during a test. The `_engine` method is using a `cache_readonly` decorator from the Pandas package to define the `_engine` method and avoid a reference cycle, passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug in the `_engine` method, we can use a lambda function to create the weak reference and instantiate the `_engine_type` class. The bug occurs because the weak reference does not have a view method, causing an AttributeError to be raised.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period(), len(self))
```

By using a lambda function, we can create a callable weak reference, which can then be used to instantiate the `_engine_type` class.

This correction should resolve the AttributeError that was raised during the failing test.
