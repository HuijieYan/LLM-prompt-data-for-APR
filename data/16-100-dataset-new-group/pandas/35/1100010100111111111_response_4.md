The issue in the buggy function is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex (`period`) is being dropped before it is intended, causing the PeriodEngine to get a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # weakly reference self
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # create the engine
    return engine
```

With this corrected version, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, ensuring that the PeriodEngine does not receive a NoneType object.

This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test case.
