## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, use weakref.proxy() to create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

## Explanation
The bug in the original function was caused by not using `weakref.proxy()` to create a weak reference to `self`, which resulted in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended. This caused the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the issue described in the GitHub report.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `weakref.proxy()` function should be used to create a weak reference to `self` instead of `weakref.ref()`. This will ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, and the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report by ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained as intended.
