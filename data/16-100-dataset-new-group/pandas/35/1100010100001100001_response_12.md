The bug in the provided function is that it returns a weak reference to `self` instead of the actual `self` object, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to change the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = self`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass self to _engine_type.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By returning the actual `self` object instead of a weak reference to `self`, the function will not create a reference cycle and the bug will be fixed.
