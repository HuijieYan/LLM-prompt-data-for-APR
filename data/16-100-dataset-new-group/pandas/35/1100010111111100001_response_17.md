The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly handling the weak reference `period`. This is causing the AttributeError when accessing the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to create a strong reference from the weak reference `period` in the `_engine` function before using it to create the engine type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Convert weak reference to strong reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we are creating a strong reference from the weak reference, which ensures that the `period` reference is not garbage collected before it is used to create the engine type.

This should fix the AttributeError and allow the failing test to pass.
