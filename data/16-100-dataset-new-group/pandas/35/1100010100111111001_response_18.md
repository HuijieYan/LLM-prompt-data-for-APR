The cause of the bug is likely due to a NoneType object being used as a base for an attribute access on line 6 of the function. This can happen when self._engine_type is not properly returning an object of the expected type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that self._engine_type returns a valid object of the expected type, and handle the case where the object is None to avoid attribute access errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type if engine_type is not None else self._default_engine()
```

In the corrected version, we use a default engine if the _engine_type returns None. This should handle the case where NoneType object causes attribute access errors and should fix the bug.
