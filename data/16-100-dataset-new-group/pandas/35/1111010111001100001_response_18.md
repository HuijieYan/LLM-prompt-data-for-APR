The bug appears to be in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function seems to be trying to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self` and then use it to instantiate an `_engine_type` object.

The bug likely arises because the weak reference is not being used properly or is unnecessary in this context.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` can be removed, and we can simply instantiate the `_engine_type` object with `self` as the first argument.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct `_engine_type` object for the given `PeriodIndex` object, and the failing test should pass.

By making this change, we remove unnecessary complexity and potential weak reference issues while still achieving the intended behavior of the `_engine` function.
