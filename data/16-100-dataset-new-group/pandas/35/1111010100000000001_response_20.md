The buggy function _engine(self) appears to be trying to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance and then use it to create a new instance of _engine_type. However, the potential error here is that the weak reference is not being properly used, and hence, causing a reference cycle.

The bug is caused by the misuse of weakref.weakref.ref() method. The weak reference should be stored in a variable and then accessed using the dereference operator '. It's also important to check if the weak reference is still alive before using it.

To fix this bug, the correct approach would be to store the weak reference in a variable, dereference it when needed, and check if it's still alive before using it. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the instance
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Check if the weak reference is still alive before using it
    if period_ref():
        # Dereference the weak reference and use it to create the _engine_type instance
        return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case when the weak reference is no longer valid
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference is no longer valid")
```

In the corrected version of the function, we store the weak reference in the period_ref variable and then check if it's still alive using the period_ref() function. If the weak reference is still valid, we dereference it and use it to create the _engine_type instance. If the weak reference is no longer valid, we raise a RuntimeError to handle that case.
