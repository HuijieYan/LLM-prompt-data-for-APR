The bug is due to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is evident in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. Given the expected output, the bug can be fixed by properly maintaining the weak reference to the PeriodIndex when passing it to the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to the PeriodEngine
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By maintaining a weak reference to self and passing it to the PeriodEngine, the bug should be resolved, and the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
