## Analysis
The `@cache_readonly` decorator is used to create a property that is computed only once and then cached. The `_engine` function is intended to return the `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `self` object to avoid a reference cycle. However, it seems that the weak reference to `self` is not being stored properly, leading to a `None` value being passed to `_engine_type`.

The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checking if certain properties are monotonic. This fails due to a weak reference issue.

## Bug Cause
The bug seems to be in the `_engine` function where the weak reference to `self` is not being properly stored and passed to `_engine_type`. This results in a `None` being passed instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

## Fix Strategy
The fix involves ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is properly stored and used in the `_engine` function when creating the `_engine_type`. Care needs to be taken to manage the weak reference properly to avoid any potential reference cycle issues.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `period()` to obtain the weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly created and used when creating the `_engine_type`, resolving the weak reference issue.
