#### Expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return:
- period: weak reference to self
- return: self._engine_type(period, len(self))

### Expected case 2
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
self, _engine_type, len(self)

#### Expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return:
- period: weak reference to self
- return: _engine_type(period, len(self))

### Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be related to the use of the weakref.ref function, which is supposed to create a weak reference to the 'self' parameter. However, it's not utilized correctly and may be causing the function to return unexpected results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly create a weak reference to the 'self' parameter and ensure that it is used correctly when calling the _engine_type function.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
