## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using a `weakref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`. The purpose of using a weak reference is to avoid a reference cycle when passing it to the `_engine_type` method. However, the bug is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before it's intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` and causing errors.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `None` value being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` method and only dropped after it's been used by the `_engine_type` method.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        return result
```
In the fixed version, we first create a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`). We then immediately use this weak reference to call the `_engine_type` method and return the result. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained until it's been used by `_engine_type`, thereby preventing the premature dropping of the weak reference.
