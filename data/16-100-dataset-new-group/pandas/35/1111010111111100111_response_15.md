The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the failing test. The bug is related to a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it should be, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to an error when attempting to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is weakly referenced and remains valid during the creation of the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained during the creation of the `PeriodEngine`, preventing it from being dropped prematurely and resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
