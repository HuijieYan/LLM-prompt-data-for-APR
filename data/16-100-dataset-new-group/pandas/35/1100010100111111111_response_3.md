### Fixing the bug
The bug is likely caused by the weakref not being properly set up in the `_engine` function, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex. To fix this, the weakref should be set up correctly to avoid the reference cycle.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type()(period, len(self))  # Corrected call to _engine_type
```

By correcting the call to `_engine_type` and passing the weakref `period` as intended, the bug should be fixed. This should prevent the PeriodEngine from receiving a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex, resolving the issue with weakrefs being dropped prematurely. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
