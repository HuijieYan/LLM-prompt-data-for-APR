## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function is a cached readonly property called `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. It is intended to return the engine type for the `PeriodIndex` based on the length of the index and a weak reference to the index itself. The issue on GitHub mentions that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, weak references are lost, resulting in unexpected behavior when accessing the levels.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error in the function is related to the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` and passing it to `_engine_type`. It seems that the weak reference is being dropped prematurely when copying the `PeriodIndex` levels, leading to `None` being passed to the `_engine_type`, which causes unexpected behavior.

## Explain the cause of the bug

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the way weak references are handled when copying `PeriodIndex` levels. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, leading to issues when accessing the levels in certain scenarios.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained even when the index is copied or when accessing its levels. This may involve modifying the caching mechanism for the `_engine` property to handle weak references more robustly.

## A corrected version of the function

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# Apply the caching decorator after fixing the function
_engine = cache_readonly(_engine)
```
