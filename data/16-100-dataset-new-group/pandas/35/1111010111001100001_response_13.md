The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without checking whether `self._engine_type` should be a method. The `_engine_type` attribute seems to be intended to hold a type that is later to be instantiated with `period` and `len(self)` as parameters.

The buggy function does not take into account that `_engine_type` should be called with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments to successfully instantiate a new object of that type.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to instantiate `self._engine_type` with `period` and `len(self)` as parameters. The corrected version is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the failing test should now pass.
