To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, and that the PeriodEngine does not receive a None value instead of the PeriodIndex.

We can achieve this by modifying the _engine function to maintain a reference to the weakref and use it to create the PeriodEngine. This will prevent the weakref from being dropped before it is intended to.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a reference to the weakref to prevent it from being dropped prematurely
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained within the function, and used to create the PeriodEngine. This will ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely, fixing the bug and allowing the test to pass successfully.
