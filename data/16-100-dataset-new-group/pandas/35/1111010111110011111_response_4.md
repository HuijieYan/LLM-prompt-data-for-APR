The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to produce the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error message. This error occurs because the `_engine` function is returning a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`. This is causing the subsequent call to `is_monotonic_increasing` to fail as it attempts to access an attribute of the `None` object.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct `PeriodEngine` object instead of `None`.

A corrected version of the `_engine` function that satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in GitHub would be as follows:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `engine_type = self._engine_type`, we ensure that the correct `PeriodEngine` type is retrieved and returned by the `_engine` function, resolving the original bug and satisfying the expected input/output values.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
