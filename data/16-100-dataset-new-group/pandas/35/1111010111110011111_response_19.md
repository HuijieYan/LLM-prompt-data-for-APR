The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the AttributeError in the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. The function is expected to return the `PeriodEngine` instance, but it is returning `None` due to the weak reference cycle not working as intended. The expected output is for the test assertion to return True.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use a `weakref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.
2. Modify the `_engine_type` call to use the weak reference instead of the original `self` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This correction should fix the bug and enable the function to return the expected `PeriodEngine` instance, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
