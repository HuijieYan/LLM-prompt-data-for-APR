Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is occurring because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex `period` is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to get a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This leads to the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error message.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the class instance, so that it remains in scope until the function's return.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an attribute of the class instance
    self._weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref_period, len(self._values))
```

By storing the weak reference as an attribute of the class instance, the reference will be maintained until the function's return, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

This should address the bug and ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until no longer needed, resolving the AttributeError and allowing the failing test to pass.
