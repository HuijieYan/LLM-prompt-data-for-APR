### Analysis
The buggy function is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is using the `cache_readonly` decorator to create a cached property called `_engine`. Inside this method, it's using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

The failing test is testing a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` as one of its levels. When `idx2` is created in the test, it uses the `_get_level_values` method of the `PeriodIndex`. The failing test asserts that all the levels of `idx2` are monotonic.

### Bug
The bug in the `_engine` method is that it creates a weak reference to `self` but doesn't use this weak reference when initializing the `_engine_type` (which is not visible in the provided code). This could potentially lead to a reference cycle issue.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be used when initializing the `_engine_type` to ensure there are no reference cycle issues.

### The corrected version

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we now pass a weak reference to the `_engine_type` initialization, resolving the potential reference cycle issue.
