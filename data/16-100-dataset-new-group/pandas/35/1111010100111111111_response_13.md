The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the attribute `view` on a `NoneType`. The issue is related to a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the engine is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def _get_engine(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    
    return _get_engine(period, len(self))
```

By creating an inner function `_get_engine` that returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, length)`, we can ensure that the weak reference to `self` is still valid when the engine is used.

This corrected version should resolve the weak reference issue and the AttributeError, allowing the failing test to pass as expected.
