### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` in an attempt to avoid a reference cycle, but it is not correctly implemented. This is causing the failing test because the construction of `MultiIndex` in the test function is not able to handle the behavior of the buggy function, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug
The bug in the function `_engine` is that it is not properly using `weakref.ref` to avoid a reference cycle. This is leading to unexpected behavior in the construction of `MultiIndex` in the test function.

### Fix Strategy
The fix for the bug is to correctly use `weakref.ref` to avoid the reference cycle as intended. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` class does not hold a strong reference to itself and the garbage collector can properly manage the objects.

### Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `_engine` function is provided below:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self.freq)
```

By correcting the use of `weakref.ref` and passing the `freq` attribute (which seems to be a required parameter for `_engine_type`), the function is now fixed. This should address the issue and the failing test should pass with the corrected `_engine` function.
