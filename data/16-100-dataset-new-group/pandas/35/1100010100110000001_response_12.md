The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then use that weak reference to instantiate an `_engine_type` object. The error message indicates that the weak reference is not working as expected, resulting in a `NoneType` error.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being used properly when creating the `_engine_type` object, leading to it being `None` and causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is used correctly to create the `_engine_type` object. We can do this by modifying the function to explicitly dereference the weak reference when creating the `_engine_type` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This ensures that the weak reference is dereferenced correctly when creating the `_engine_type` object, preventing the `NoneType` error.
