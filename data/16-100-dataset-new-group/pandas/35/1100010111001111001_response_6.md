The bug in the `_engine` function is likely to be caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference to the object passed to it, but in this case, it should be used to create a weak reference to `self` and not to `period`.

To fix this bug, we should use `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This will correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object and avoid the reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
