The bug in the function `_engine` of the `PeriodIndex` class is caused by the weak reference `period` being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. The weak reference is not being correctly stored, causing it to be dropped prematurely, resulting in the `_engine` function returning a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

To fix this bug, the weak reference `period` should be stored properly to keep it from being dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an instance variable within the `PeriodIndex` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self as an instance variable
    self._weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref_period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` will be retained, preventing it from being dropped prematurely and resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
