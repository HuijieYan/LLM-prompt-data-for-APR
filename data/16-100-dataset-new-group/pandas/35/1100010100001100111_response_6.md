The potential error in the buggy function is with the weakref usage:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
The bug is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the usage in the _engine function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we maintain a weak reference to the PeriodIndex and prevent it from being dropped before intended.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is preserved as expected.
