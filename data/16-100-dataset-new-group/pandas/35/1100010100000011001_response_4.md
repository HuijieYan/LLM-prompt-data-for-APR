#### Expected input
- `self`: an instance of a period index

#### Expected output
- `_engine`: an instance of the engine_type class, initialized with a weakref to the input `self` and the length of `self`

### Bug analysis
The bug seems to be in the assignment of `period`. The function is trying to create a weak reference to `self` but it's not correctly implemented.

### Bug fix
To fix the bug, we should correctly create a weak reference to `self` using the `weakref` module.

### Corrected code
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
