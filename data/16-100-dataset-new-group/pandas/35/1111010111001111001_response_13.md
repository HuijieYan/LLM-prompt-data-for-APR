The bug is in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, the `self._engine_type` should not take a weak reference as an argument, but rather the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be updated to provide the actual `PeriodIndex` object instead of a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should fix the bug and ensure that the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
