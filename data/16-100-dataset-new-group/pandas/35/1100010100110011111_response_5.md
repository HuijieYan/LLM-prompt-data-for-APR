The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return a weakly referenced `self._engine_type` object. However, based on the error message, it seems to be returning a `NoneType` object, which does not have the attribute `view`. This is causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained and that the `self._engine_type` object is correctly returned from the `_engine` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

With this corrected version, the function should now return the `self._engine_type` object as intended, and the failing test case should pass, satisfying the expected output as described in the GitHub issue.
