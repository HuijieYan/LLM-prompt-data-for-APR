The bug is likely related to the `_engine_type` attribute being set to `None` instead of an expected engine type. This is indicated by the AttributeError in the error message, where the `_engine` is None.

To fix this bug, it seems that the `_engine_type` attribute should be set to an appropriate period engine type.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_type = # Set this to an appropriate period engine type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
