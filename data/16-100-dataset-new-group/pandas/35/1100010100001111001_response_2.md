The potential error in the buggy function lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. This can lead to a reference cycle issue.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not being used correctly, leading to potential memory management issues.

To fix the bug, we should use the weak reference object to access the original object using the `weakref()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
