The issue in the buggy function is that it is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not calling the weak reference object to retrieve the original object. This means that `period` is actually a weak reference object, and passing it to `_engine_type` will not retrieve the original object as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to call the weak reference object `period` to retrieve the original object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By calling `weakref.ref(self)()` we retrieve the original object from the weak reference, which can then be passed to `_engine_type`.

After applying this fix, the provided failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass without any issues.
