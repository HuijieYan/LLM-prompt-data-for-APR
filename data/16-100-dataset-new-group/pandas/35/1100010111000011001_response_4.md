The buggy function `_engine` is using the `cache_readonly` decorator, which indicates that it's meant to cache the return value of the function. However, the function is not actually caching anything, which may cause unexpected behavior if the function is called multiple times, as it would not return the same value.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is not caching the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, so it will recalculate the value every time it's called.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to actually cache the result using the `cache_readonly` decorator.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function will now cache the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` and return the cached result on subsequent calls, thus fixing the bug.
