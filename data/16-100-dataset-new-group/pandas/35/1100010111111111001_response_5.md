The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is returning `None`, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute. This is likely due to an issue with the implementation of the weak reference and the `_engine_type` function.

To fix the bug, the weak reference creation and usage should be reviewed, and the `_engine_type` function should be called properly to avoid returning `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# This is the fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    return engine_type(period, len(self)) if engine_type is not None else None
```

By modifying the function to properly call `_engine_type` and return its result, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass.
