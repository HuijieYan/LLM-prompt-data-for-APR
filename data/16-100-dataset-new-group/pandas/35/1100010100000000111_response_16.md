## Analysis:
The `_engine` function is using weakref to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then passing it to `_engine_type` method. However, there seems to be an issue with the weak reference, as it is being dropped before intended.

## Potential Error Locations:
The weak reference creation using `weakref.ref(self)` and the usage of the weak reference in `self._engine_type` method could be potential error locations.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, which results in the `PeriodEngine` getting a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is being maintained correctly and not dropped prematurely.

## The Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are now invoking the weak reference `period` using parentheses `period()`, which ensures that the weak reference is being maintained.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub by ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` correctly without it being dropped prematurely.
