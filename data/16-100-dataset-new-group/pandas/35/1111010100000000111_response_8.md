## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference not being maintained correctly.

## Potential Error Location:
The issue could be related to the weak reference not being maintained, leading to `self` being dropped before intended.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` needs to be handled properly to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Maintain a strong reference to period() to hold the reference.
    _period = period()
    if _period is not None:  # Check if the weak reference is still live
        return self._engine_type(_period, len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case when _period has been collected, return a relevant value or raise an error
        # For example:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex has been collected.")
```

In the corrected version, we create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` and then store it in `_period`. We check if the weak reference is still live with `if _period is not None` before using it to create the `PeriodEngine`. If the weak reference has been collected, we handle this case appropriately, for example by raising an error or returning a relevant value. This ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained correctly.
