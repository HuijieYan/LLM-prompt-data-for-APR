The bug is related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` in the `_engine` function, leading to a `NoneType` object error in the failing test. The bug is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. The expected output is for the failing test to return `True`.

To fix the bug, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` should be retained and properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor using `weakref.proxy(self)`. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` remains referenced and accessible in the `_engine_type` without causing a reference cycle.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test return the expected output.
