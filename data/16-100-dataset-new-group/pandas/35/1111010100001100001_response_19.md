The buggy function `_engine` is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, but the function itself is not accepting any parameters. This means that it is intended to be used as a property of the `PeriodIndex` class, but it is not designed to take any input. The purpose of this function is to initialize and return the engine type for the `PeriodIndex` class.

The bug in this function is that it is attempting to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not properly handling the weak reference. It should be using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to use `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then return the engine type using that weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
