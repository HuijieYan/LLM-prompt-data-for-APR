The buggy function is `_engine(self)` and it seems to be related to creating an engine for the PeriodIndex class. The potential error locations within the function could be in the weakref usage or in the instantiation of the `_engine_type` object.

The cause of the bug could be related to the weak reference usage and the instantiation of the `_engine_type` object. It seems that the weakref usage may not be correctly handling the reference to self, which could lead to a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to use the weakref module to create a weak reference for the self parameter and then pass that weak reference to the instantiation of the `_engine_type` object. This will help to avoid any potential reference cycle issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

In this corrected version, we are creating a weak reference for the `self` parameter and then passing that weak reference to the instantiation of the `_engine_type` object, using `len(self._data)` to get the length of the data within the PeriodIndex.
