The issue here is that the `_engine` function is using a weak reference incorrectly. It should be maintaining a reference to the original `PeriodIndex` object to prevent it from being dropped prematurely.

The bug is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to maintain a strong reference to the original `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By using `self` directly instead of a weak reference, we prevent the `PeriodIndex` object from being dropped prematurely, resolving the issue.

This correction should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
