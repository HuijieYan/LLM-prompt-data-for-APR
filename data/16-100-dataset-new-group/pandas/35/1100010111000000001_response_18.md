## Analysis
The `_engine` function is a property decorated with `@cache_readonly`, which caches the result of the function the first time it's called and returns the cached result on subsequent calls. The function appears to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` doesn't actually directly call the `_engine` function. However, it does create a `PeriodIndex` which then indirectly calls `_engine` due to the implementation of `PeriodIndex`. This suggests that the bug may be related to the `PeriodIndex` implementation of calling `_engine`.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location seems to be the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. Since the `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object, it should be used to access the original object, rather than being directly passed to another function.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the fact that the weak reference is being passed directly to `_engine_type` instead of being dereferenced to obtain the original object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The correct approach would be to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the original object is being passed, rather than the weak reference.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to obtain the original object
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
