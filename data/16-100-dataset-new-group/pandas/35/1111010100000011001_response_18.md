#### The expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
The function returns the result of calling `self._engine_type` with the parameters `period` and `len(self)`. The expected return value should be the result of this function call.

#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
self, 

#### The expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
The function returns the result of calling `self._engine_type` with the parameters `period` and `len(self)`. The expected return value should be the result of this function call.

### Cause of the bug
The buggy function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then passes it to `self._engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, it seems that the purpose of creating a weak reference is to avoid reference cycles, but the implementation is incorrect and doesn't serve the intended purpose.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `self._engine_type` to avoid reference cycles, as intended.


## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
