The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error suggests that `_engine` may be returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`. This may be causing all methods that should be referencing the `_engine` object to fail. The `_engine` function has a decorator `@cache_readonly` which may be causing this issue. 

To fix this, the `@cache_readonly` decorator might not be necessary. By removing this decorator from the `_engine` function, the logic of the function should work as expected, returning the engine object rather than `None`. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
With the `_cache_readonly` decorator removed, the corrected `_engine` function should be able to properly return the `PeriodEngine` instead of `None`. After making this change, run the failing test to ensure that the corrected function passes the test.
