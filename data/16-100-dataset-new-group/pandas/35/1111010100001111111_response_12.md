The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function is that it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but `period` is a weak reference. This means that `_engine_type` will receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object it expects, resulting in the error described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to get the actual PeriodIndex object
    period_index = self
    return self._engine_type(period_index, len(self))
```
