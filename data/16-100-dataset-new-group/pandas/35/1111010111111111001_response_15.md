To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` object is properly initialized before accessing its attributes.

The bug is likely caused by the `_engine_type` not correctly initializing the `PeriodEngine` object, resulting in a `NoneType` object that has no attribute 'view'.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to explicitly check if the `_engine_type` constructor returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object. If it does, then return the engine, otherwise handle the error appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Failed to initialize the PeriodEngine object")
```

With this fix, the `_engine` function should properly return a valid `PeriodEngine` object, resolving the `NoneType` attribute error.

This should address the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes as expected.
