The buggy function `_engine` has a potential error at the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` which weakly references `self`. However, there is no check for `period` being `None` in the subsequent line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which could result in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

The cause of the bug is that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is lost, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is not `None` before passing it to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. We can also check for `None` in the `_engine` method and handle it accordingly. Additionally, we should ensure that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is preserved.

The corrected version of the buggy function `_engine` is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period():
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case when period is None
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is None.")
```
