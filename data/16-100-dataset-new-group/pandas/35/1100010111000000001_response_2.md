Buggy function:
The _engine function in the period.py file is buggy. It uses weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to self, and then passes it to self._engine_type along with the length of self. This function is failing to return the correct result and causing the test_get_level_values_when_periods test to fail.

The potential error:
The weakref.ref(self) is not being used correctly. It should be storing a weak reference to the object self, but it is not being handled properly.

Cause of the bug:
The weakref function in the _engine is not correctly creating a weak reference to the object, causing the test to fail. This is because the weak reference is not being used as intended.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The weak reference should be correctly created and used within the _engine function in order to avoid a reference cycle. By ensuring that the weak reference is used as intended, we can prevent the bug and make sure the function returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Get the length of self
    length = len(self)
    # Return the result by passing the weakref object and the length to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, length)
```

With this correction, the _engine function should now return the correct result and pass the failing test.
