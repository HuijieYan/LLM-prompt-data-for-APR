Based on the given information, it appears that the bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the incorrect use of weakref and the `_engine_type` method. The weakref should be used to create a weak reference to the object `self`, but it seems to be incorrectly passed as an argument to `_engine_type`. It's likely that this is causing the function to return unexpected values, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be used appropriately to avoid a reference cycle, and the `_engine_type` method should be called with the correct parameters to ensure the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the `_engine` function should now return the expected values and satisfy the failing test.
