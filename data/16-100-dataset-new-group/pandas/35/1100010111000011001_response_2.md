Based on the buggy function and the failing test, the issue appears to be with the _engine property of the PeriodIndex class. The _engine property is expected to return an engine instance based on the length of the PeriodIndex. However, the weakref usage is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect use of weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to self. This results in period being a weak reference object, not the actual period object.

To fix the bug, the correct usage of weak reference should be to create a weak reference to the object by using weakref.proxy(self) instead of weakref.ref(self).

Here's the correct version of the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
