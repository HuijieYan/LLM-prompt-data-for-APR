The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference `period` being created but not used anywhere. 

To fix this bug, we can remove the weak reference and simply pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
