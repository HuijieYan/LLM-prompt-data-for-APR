The bug in the provided function is causing the error message AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it's intended to.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the execution of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using period() instead of period, we ensure that we are maintaining a reference to the PeriodIndex object, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
