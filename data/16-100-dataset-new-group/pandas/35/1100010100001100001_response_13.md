### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that it is intended to be a cached property. However, the usage of `weakref.ref` seems incorrect and may be causing the issue.

### Bug
The bug seems to be with the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. This creates a weak reference to the `self` object, which is not necessary in this context and may be causing incorrect behavior.

### Fix
Remove the usage of `weakref.ref` and simply pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the fixed version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
