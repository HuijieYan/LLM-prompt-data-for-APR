The bug in the provided function `_engine` appears to be related to weak reference usage and the PeriodEngine class. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised, specifically `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being dropped prematurely, leading to a NoneType object being accessed in the PeriodEngine class.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex should be maintained until it is no longer needed, ensuring that the PeriodEngine can access the correct PeriodIndex object.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference to the `self` is passed to the `_engine_type` as intended, and the `()` at the end of the return statement is used to immediately invoke the `_engine_type` function, ensuring that the weak reference remains valid until it's no longer needed.

This corrected version should address the premature dropping of the weak reference and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
