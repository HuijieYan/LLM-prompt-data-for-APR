#### The expected output of the buggy function
The expected output is of the correct type and contains the correct value.

### Expected case 2
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
self, len(self)

#### The expected output of the buggy function
The expected output is of the correct type and contains the correct value.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the _engine function returning a 'NoneType' object, which leads to an AttributeError when the subsequent operation is performed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The issue may be associated with how the weak reference to the self object is being handled in the _engine function. It is possible that the weak reference is not being properly converted back to the original object. To fix this bug, the weak reference to the self object needs to be correctly converted back to the original object before returning.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use the weak reference to create a strong reference
    period = weakref.ref(self).__class__(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
