The buggy function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator which is not a valid decorator in pandas. This is causing the function to fail when called, resulting in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the `@cache_readonly` decorator from the `_engine` function as it is not a valid decorator for this context.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should no longer fail when called and the failing test should pass.
