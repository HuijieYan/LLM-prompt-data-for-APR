The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the weak reference not being properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the `PeriodIndex` as intended, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor to avoid the reference cycle issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we are now using `period()` to create a weak reference to `self`, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` is properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test passes.
