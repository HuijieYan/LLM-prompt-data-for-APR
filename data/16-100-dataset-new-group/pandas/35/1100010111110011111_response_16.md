The bug is caused by the 'PeriodEngine' receiving a weakly referenced 'PeriodIndex', which is being dropped before its intended use. This results in the 'PeriodEngine' receiving a 'None' object instead of the 'PeriodIndex', which causes the AttributeError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'PeriodIndex' is not dropped before it is used by the 'PeriodEngine' to avoid the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Avoid dropping the weakly referenced PeriodIndex prematurely
    period = weakref.ref(self).pop()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weakly referenced 'PeriodIndex' is used by the 'PeriodEngine' without being dropped prematurely, thus resolving the AttributeError issue in the failing test.
