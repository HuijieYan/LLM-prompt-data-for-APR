```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The potential error in the `buggy function`:
- The `weakref.ref(self)` might not be captured correctly and hence the `_engine_type` function receives a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing the `_engine` function to incorrectly capture the weak reference of `self`, resulting in the `_engine_type` function receiving a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference of `self` is correctly captured and passed to the `_engine_type` function.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
