Based on the error message, it seems that the `_engine_type` method is not correctly handling the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object, causing it to receive a `None` object instead. This is likely leading to the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference to `self` and ensure that it can be used within the `_engine_type` method without losing its reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weakly referenced PeriodIndex object within _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can pass a weakly referenced proxy of `self` to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is not lost prematurely.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `_engine` function correctly handles weak references to `PeriodIndex` objects.
