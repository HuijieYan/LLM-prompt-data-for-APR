The bug in the function is likely that the weakref is not being properly created to avoid a reference cycle, leading to potential memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

To fix this, we can modify the function to properly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import cache_readonly

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the function will properly create a weak reference to `self` and use it when calling `_engine_type`, avoiding potential reference cycle issues and providing the expected behavior.
