The bug causing the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue come from the weak references being dropped before they should, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This triggers an AttributeError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine. This can be achieved by modifying the _engine function to maintain the weak reference as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    weakref.finalize(self, period, self._cleanup)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we use the weakref.finalize function to ensure that self._cleanup is called when the weak reference period is finalized. This will help maintain the weak reference until it's no longer needed.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
