## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `self._engine` attribute is a `NoneType` object, which causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute. This points to the fact that the `_engine` function is not returning the expected value, which is leading to the failure of the test.

## Bug Location
The potential error location is the `_engine` function itself, as it is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine type.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is likely related to the implementation of the `_engine` function. It seems that the weak reference `period` is not being properly handled, resulting in the returned value being `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be handled correctly, and the `_engine` function should return the correct engine type instead of a `NoneType` object.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    return engine_type(period, len(self)) if engine_type else None
```
