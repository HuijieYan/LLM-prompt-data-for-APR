The bug in the provided function `_engine` appears to be related to weak referencing and the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access a method on the NoneType object.

An issue on GitHub titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" describes a similar problem with weak references being dropped before intended.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object needs to be stored using the `self` reference. This ensures that the weak reference does not get dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Return the desired engine type passing the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing a weak reference to `self` in a variable `self_weakref` and passing `self_weakref` to the `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference does not get lost, and the function should no longer lead to the AttributeError that was observed in the failing test case.
