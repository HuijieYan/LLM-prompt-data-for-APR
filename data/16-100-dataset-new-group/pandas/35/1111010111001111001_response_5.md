The bug in the `_engine` function is likely caused by the incorrect usage of weakref.ref(). The weak reference should be assigned to the variable `period` as `period = weakref.ref(self)`, but it is not being used properly while creating the `_engine_type` object.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be passed to the `_engine_type` as the first argument.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self._values)
```

In this corrected function, the weak reference `period` is passed as the first argument to `_engine_type`, along with the length of the period index `len(self)` and the period values `self._values`.

This should resolve the issue and the failing test case should pass with this corrected version.
