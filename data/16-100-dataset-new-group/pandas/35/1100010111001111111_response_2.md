The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object to be dropped before it is intended to, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object and ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

The provided fix ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` function, preventing the premature dropping of the reference.

With this fix, the failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should now pass, and the behavior of the `_engine` function should align with the expected output. Additionally, this fix should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".
