The issue seems to be related to a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object being dropped before it should be, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference and ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly handled and the `PeriodIndex` object is not dropped prematurely.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the failing test passes.
