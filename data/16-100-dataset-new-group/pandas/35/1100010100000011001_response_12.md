### Analysis
The function `_engine` is supposed to return the result of calling `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self` as parameters. However, the function is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly.

### Bug
The bug in the function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self`, but it is not using this weak reference when calling `_engine_type`. Instead, it is passing the weak reference object itself as the first parameter to `_engine_type`, which is incorrect.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to use the weak reference object to obtain a reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
