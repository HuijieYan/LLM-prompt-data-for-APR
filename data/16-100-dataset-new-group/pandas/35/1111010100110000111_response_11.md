## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the weakrefs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The weak reference to `self` might be getting dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To fix this, we can modify the `_engine` function to use a `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create the weak reference to `self`. This will ensure that the weak reference to `self` is not prematurely dropped.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By replacing `period = weakref.ref(self)` with `period = weakref.proxy(self)`, we are ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of `_engine`. This should prevent the issue described in the GitHub bug report and allow the test to pass.
