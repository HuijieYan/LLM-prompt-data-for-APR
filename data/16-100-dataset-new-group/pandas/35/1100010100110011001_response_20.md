The function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self`, and then return the result of calling `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self` as arguments. However, it seems that `_engine_type` is not handling the weak reference properly, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is handled appropriately and that we are able to access the necessary attributes and methods from the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).values
```

By using the `.values` attribute at the end of the function, we are ensuring that we are accessing the underlying values of the `_engine_type` object, which should avoid any issues related to weak references or NoneType objects.

This fix should resolve the AttributeError seen in the failing test.
