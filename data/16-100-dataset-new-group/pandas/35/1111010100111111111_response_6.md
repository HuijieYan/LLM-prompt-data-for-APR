The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute. This bug is causing the failing test in the GitHub issue "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped before being used by the `PeriodEngine`. We can modify the `_engine` function to use a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instead of a weak reference, so that it is not inadvertently dropped.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By using `self` directly instead of a weak reference, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is retained and passed to the `PeriodEngine` as intended. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test passes.
