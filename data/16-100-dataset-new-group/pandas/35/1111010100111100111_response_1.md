The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` is created. This can be achieved by using the weak reference inside a function that is immediately called to create the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    ...
    """
    
    # The corrected _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use a lambda function to create the PeriodEngine while maintaining a weak reference to self
        create_engine = lambda: self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
        return create_engine()
```

By creating a lambda function that immediately calls and returns the `PeriodEngine`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` is created, thus resolving the issue of the `NoneType` object being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

This should address the bug and ensure that the failing test case in the GitHub issue also passes successfully.
