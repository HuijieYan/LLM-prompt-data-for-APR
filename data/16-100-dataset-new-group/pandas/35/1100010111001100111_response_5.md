The root cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until after the `_engine_type` has been called. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference in a variable that persists for the lifetime of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `period_ref` variable, we ensure that the reference to `self` persists until it is needed by the `_engine_type` function. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes as expected.
