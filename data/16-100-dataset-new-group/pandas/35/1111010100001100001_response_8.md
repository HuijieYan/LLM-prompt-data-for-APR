The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method that returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The purpose of using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object is to avoid creating a reference cycle, which could potentially lead to memory leaks.

The bug in the provided function is not immediately visible based on the function's code alone. However, the purpose of the function indicates that it is intended to create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the PeriodIndex.

Based on the provided runtime values and types, it seems that the buggy function is not correctly creating the weak reference to the `self` object and passing it to `_engine_type`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `from weakref import ref`, we explicitly import the `ref` function from the `weakref` module. Then, we use `ref(self)` to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object, and pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the PeriodIndex.
