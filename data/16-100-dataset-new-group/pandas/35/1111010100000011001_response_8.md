#### Explanation
The buggy function is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator to create a cached read-only property called `_engine`. This property is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then passing it to `_engine_type` to create an engine object.

The potential error is in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This is unnecessary and can cause the weak reference to be lost when the cache gets cleared.

#### Bug
The bug is that the weak reference is used unnecessarily, and it may not serve the intended purpose. Weak references are typically used to avoid reference cycles in long-lived objects, but in this case, it is not needed.

#### Fix
The weak reference can be removed and the `self` object can be directly passed to `_engine_type` to create the engine object.

#### Updated code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
