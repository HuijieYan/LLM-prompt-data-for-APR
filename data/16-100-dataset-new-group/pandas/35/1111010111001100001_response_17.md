The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is not correctly returning the engine type for the PeriodIndex.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to correctly return the engine type for the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self.freq)
```

In the corrected version, the `freq` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` object is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the weak reference to the `self` object and the length of the index. This will ensure that the engine type is correctly initialized for the `PeriodIndex` object.
