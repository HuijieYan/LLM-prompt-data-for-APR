The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError due to the weak reference to `self` being dropped before intended.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is being assigned to the local variable `period`, which gets garbage collected after the function ends. This results in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix the bug, we need to keep a reference to the weak reference `period` so that it is not garbage collected. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `self` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a reference to the weakref to prevent it from being garbage collected
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as `self._period_ref`, we ensure that the weak reference is not garbage collected and is available for use in the `_engine_type` constructor. This should resolve the AttributeError and ensure that the function works as expected.

This fix should also resolve the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs". This is because once the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained, the `PeriodEngine` will not receive a `None` when trying to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.
