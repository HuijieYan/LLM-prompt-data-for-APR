The bug occurs in the `_engine` function, where it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This function is expected to return the engine type for the given period with the length of the input.

The error message from the failing test indicates an AttributeError in the `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` line within the `_do_monotonic_check` method.

This suggests that the `_engine_type` function is not returning the expected type, leading to an AttributeError when attempting to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to correctly return the engine type, ensuring that it returns the expected type to avoid the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type
```

In this correction, the `_engine` function should return the `_engine_type` without any additional arguments. This way, it ensures that the correct engine type is returned, avoiding the AttributeError when accessing the `view` attribute.
