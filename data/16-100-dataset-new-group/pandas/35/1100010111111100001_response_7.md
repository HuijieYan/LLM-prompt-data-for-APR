The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

The bug is likely in the `_engine` function, which returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` using `weakref.ref(self)`. This construction is creating a weak reference to self, which is leading to a `NoneType` object during a part of the execution.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_engine` function to return a strong reference instead of a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This modification will ensure that the function returns a strong reference to `self` instead of a weak reference, resolving the AttributeError issue in the failing test.
