The bug in the `_engine` function is most likely caused by the weakref.ref function. The weak reference created with weakref.ref() should be assigned to a local variable and then used to obtain the original reference. However, in the provided code, the weak reference is being directly returned instead of the original reference.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be assigned to a local variable and then returned. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The corrected version ensures that the weak reference is first assigned to the `period` variable and then used to obtain the original reference before returning it. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
