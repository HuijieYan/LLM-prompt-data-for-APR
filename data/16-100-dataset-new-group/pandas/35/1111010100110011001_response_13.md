Given the error message, it seems that the bug is related to the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', suggesting that the `_engine` method is returning `None` instead of the expected object.

The problem lies in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The method is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it looks like the weak reference is not being created or maintained properly, resulting in the method returning `None`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` method to ensure that the weak reference is properly created and maintained. Additionally, we should ensure that it returns the expected object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

By ensuring that the weak reference is correctly created and used, and that the `_engine` method returns the expected object, we can fix the bug. This should address the AttributeError that was being raised and ensure that the `_engine` method works as expected.
