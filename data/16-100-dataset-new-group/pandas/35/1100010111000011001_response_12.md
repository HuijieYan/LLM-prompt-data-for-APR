### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. This is an incorrect usage of `weakref` and is likely causing the bug.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the weak reference is being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the actual object `self`. This leads to unexpected behavior when using the weak reference to access the object in `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix
The fix for this bug is to simply pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
