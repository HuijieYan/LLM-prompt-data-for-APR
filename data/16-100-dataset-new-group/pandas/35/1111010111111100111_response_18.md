Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is caused by the weakref not being properly retained in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. This leads to the `_engine` method returning a NoneType object, causing the AttributeError in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` method needs to properly retain the weak reference using a lambda function. The lambda function creates a bound method that retains the weak reference, preventing it from being garbage collected prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(lambda: weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

With this change, the weak reference to `self` is properly retained using the lambda function, preventing it from being garbage collected prematurely. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.

The corrected `_engine` method ensures that the weak reference to `self` is properly retained, allowing the PeriodEngine to access the PeriodIndex as intended.
