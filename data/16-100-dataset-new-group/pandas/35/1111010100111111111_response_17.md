## The analysis of the buggy function

1. The buggy function is `_engine`, which is a `@cache_readonly` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. It tries to create a `PeriodEngine` instance using weak referencing `self`, but the weak referencing doesn't seem to work correctly, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
   
2. The potential error locations are:
   - The creation of the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` might not work as expected.
   - The instantiation of the `PeriodEngine` using the weak reference `period` might not handle the weak reference correctly.

3. The cause of the bug:
   - The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` receives a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, and this is due to a weak reference issue.
   - The runtime and expected input/output values match, indicating that the problem lies within the `_engine` function itself.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak referencing is correctly setup and utilized within the `_engine` function.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return PeriodEngine(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are using `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self` and passing it to the `PeriodEngine` constructor. This should correctly handle the weak referencing and prevent the `NoneType` issue.
