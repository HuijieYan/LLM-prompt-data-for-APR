## The corrected version of the function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type().set_period(period, len(self))
```
By modifying the _engine function to use the set_period method of the engine type, we can ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
