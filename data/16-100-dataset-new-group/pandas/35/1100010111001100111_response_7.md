## Fixed Version

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

The bug in the original function is that it's passing `period` as a weak reference to `_engine_type` instead of calling it to get the weak reference object. This leads to the PeriodIndex getting dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

By changing `period` to `period()`, we are calling the weak reference object to get the actual weakly referenced PeriodIndex, which resolves the issue.

After making this change, the function should return the expected output from the failing test, resolving the GitHub issue.

The corrected function is provided above.
