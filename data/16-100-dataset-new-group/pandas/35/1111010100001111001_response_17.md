It seems that the `_engine` function is intended to return an instance of `self._engine_type` using a weak reference to `self`. 

The cause of the bug is likely that the `period` variable should be accessed as `period()` instead of `period`. Using `()`, we can access the weak reference object and return a proper instance of `_engine_type` with the weakly referenced `self`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to correctly access the weak reference object and return the `_engine_type` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
