The bug in the function `_engine` is likely to be in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This line is intended to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is currently being assigned to a local variable `period` which is not being used.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to the `self` object is not being properly utilized. This can lead to potential memory leaks and reference cycles.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be utilized to avoid reference cycles. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we directly pass the weak reference to the `_engine_type` method, avoiding the creation of an unnecessary local variable and properly utilizing the weak reference feature.
