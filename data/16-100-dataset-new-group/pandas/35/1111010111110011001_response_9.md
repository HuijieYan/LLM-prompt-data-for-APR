- `self`: an instance of the `PeriodIndex` class

#### Expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
- `period`: a weak reference to `self`
- `len(self)`: an integer representing the length of `self`

### Expected case 2
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
self, len(self)

#### Expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
- `period`: a weak reference to `self`
- `len(self)`: an integer representing the length of `self`

### Bugs in the buggy function
The `_engine` function should return an instance of `PeriodEngine`, which is responsible for handling period-specific attributes and operations. However, the current implementation does not create and return a valid instance of `PeriodEngine`.

The issue seems to be with the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line. It's likely that `self._engine_type` is not properly creating and returning a `PeriodEngine` instance.

### Fixing the bug
We need to ensure that `self._engine_type` creates and returns a valid `PeriodEngine` instance. This may involve updating the `_engine_type` method in the `PeriodIndex` class.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```
