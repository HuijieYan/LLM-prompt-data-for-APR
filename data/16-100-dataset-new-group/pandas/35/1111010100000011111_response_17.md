To fix the buggy function, we need to address the issue with weak references being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the PeriodIndex. 

The root cause of the bug lies in the use of weakref.ref() within the _engine function. Weak references are not being properly handled causing the PeriodEngine to receive None.

To fix the bug, we should modify the _engine function to properly handle weak references and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using weakref.proxy() instead of weakref.ref(), we create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex that will behave as if it were the original object. This ensures that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex and resolves the issue with weak references being dropped prematurely.

This corrected version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
