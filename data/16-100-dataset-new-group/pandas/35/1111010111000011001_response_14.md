### Analysis
The function `_engine` is using `cache_readonly`, indicating that it is caching the return value of the function. The bug could be related to how the caching is being handled.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be related to the caching mechanism used in the `_engine` function. The weak reference to self might be getting lost or not being correctly used when retrieving the cached value, resulting in unexpected behavior during the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
One possible fix strategy could be to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly retained when caching the return value of the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    if getattr(self, '_engine_cached', None) is None:
        self._engine_cached = self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
    return self._engine_cached
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self`. This ensures that a weak reference to `self` is used when caching the return value.
- We check if the cached value exists before creating a new one, ensuring that the caching mechanism works as expected.
