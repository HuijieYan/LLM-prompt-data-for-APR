The buggy function `_engine` is using `cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests it is intended to cache the result of the function and return the cached value on subsequent calls. However, the function does not seem to be caching the result correctly.

In the provided test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, a `PeriodIndex` is created and then `MultiIndex` is created based on the `PeriodIndex`. The test is checking if the levels of the `MultiIndex` are monotonic.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is not caching the result properly, resulting in unnecessary recalculations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the result of the `_engine` function is cached and returned on subsequent calls.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine_cached'):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._engine_cached = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_cached
```

By using `self._engine_cached` to cache the result of the `_engine` function, we ensure that the result is calculated only once and then returned on subsequent calls.

With this correction, the `_engine` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test.
