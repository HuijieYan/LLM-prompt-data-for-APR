The given buggy function is the `_engine` function from the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. It uses the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which indicates that the function value should be cached after the first call.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` from the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` creates a `PeriodIndex` and attempts to check if the index levels are monotonic. This test relies on the `_engine` function from the `PeriodIndex` class.

The error message indicates that the `_engine` attribute is returning a 'NoneType' object and is unable to access the `view` attribute on that object.

The bug is likely caused by a problem in the implementation of the `_engine` function, which leads to it returning `None` when it should return an engine object.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine object instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

By returning the `engine` object instead of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, the bug is fixed, and the corrected version of the `_engine` function should now pass the failing test.
