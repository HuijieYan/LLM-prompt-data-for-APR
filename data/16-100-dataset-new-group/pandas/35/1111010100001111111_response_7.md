The bug in the function `_engine` is causing weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing the issue when trying to check if all levels of a `MultiIndex` are monotonically increasing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference to `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self`, allowing the `PeriodEngine` to maintain a reference to the `PeriodIndex` as intended.

By making this change, we ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` will not be dropped prematurely, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
