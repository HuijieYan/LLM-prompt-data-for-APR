The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be failing because it is returning an instance of `PeriodEngine` that does not have a `view` attribute, leading to the `AttributeError` in the failing test message.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the creation and return of the `PeriodEngine` instance, ensuring that it has the necessary attributes including `view`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Important: Check if _engine_type is None to avoid AttributeError
    if self._engine_type is None:
        self._engine_type = YourPeriodEngineClass  # Replace YourPeriodEngineClass with the actual class
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Replace `YourPeriodEngineClass` with the actual name of the class that corresponds to the `PeriodEngine` within the `pandas` package.

By making this modification, the newly returned `PeriodEngine` instance should contain the necessary attributes, fixing the AttributeError in the failing test.
