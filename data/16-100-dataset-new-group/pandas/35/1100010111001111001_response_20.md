The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be with the way it is creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`. This is likely causing issues with referencing the correct object and could be leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should create a strong reference to `self` and pass that to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly retain a strong reference to `self` and avoid the issues related to weak referencing. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test case.
