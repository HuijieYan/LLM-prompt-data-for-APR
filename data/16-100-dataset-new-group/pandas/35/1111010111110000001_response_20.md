The buggy function is `_engine` and it is part of the `PeriodIndex` class. The failing test is `test_get_level_values_when_periods` which fails when it tries to check if the levels of the `MultiIndex` it's constructing are all monotonic.

The error message indicates that the function `is_monotonic_increasing` in the base class `IndexEngine` is throwing an error because it is not able to find the attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning an incorrect object (likely `None`) which is causing this error.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` method should be changed to return a valid non-None object. It seems that the `_engine_type` method is intended to be called with a reference to `self`. We should consider passing `period` (a weak reference to the `self` object) to the `_engine_type` method in order to avoid a reference cycle and fix the bug.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```

By making this change, the function should return a valid object and the failing test should pass.
