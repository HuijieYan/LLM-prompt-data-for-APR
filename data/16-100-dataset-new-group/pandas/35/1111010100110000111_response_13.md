Since the bug is related to weakrefs and losing references when copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, the issue seems to be in the `_engine` function, where the weak reference to `self` is being used to create the `_engine_type` object. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being used instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the weak reference being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` object instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference handling within the `_engine` function needs to be reviewed and modified to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the process, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With the corrected function, the weak reference to `self` is maintained within the `_engine` function, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
