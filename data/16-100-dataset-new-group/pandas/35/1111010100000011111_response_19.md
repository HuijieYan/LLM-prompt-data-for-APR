The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing issues with weakrefs being dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` as expected. This results in errors when checking if the levels are monotonic in a `MultiIndex`.

The cause of the bug is that the `weakref` usage in the `_engine` function is incorrect, causing the reference to the `PeriodIndex` to be lost prematurely. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, causing errors.

To fix the bug, the `weakref` should be created for the `PeriodIndex` in a way that it is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function, ensuring that the reference is valid when passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weakref that is maintained throughout the function call
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Use the weakref in the engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
In this corrected version, the weakref `period_ref` is created and maintained throughout the function call, ensuring that the reference to the `PeriodIndex` is valid when passed to the `PeriodEngine`. This should resolve the issue and provide the expected output.
