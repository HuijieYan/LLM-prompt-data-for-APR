The buggy function is `_engine` and the corresponding error message indicates an AttributeError, specifically that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This error is occurring in the context of the `PeriodEngine` class, where an attribute 'view' is being accessed on an object that is of type 'None'.

The cause of the bug is within the _engine function, which is returning a NoneType object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` instance. This may be happening due to incorrect instantiation or type mismatch within the `_engine_type` function.

To fix the bug, the instantiation process within the `_engine` function needs to be checked to ensure that it correctly returns an instance of `PeriodEngine` rather than None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_instance is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to instantiate PeriodEngine")
    return engine_instance
```
