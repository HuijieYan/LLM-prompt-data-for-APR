Since the issue seems to be related to weak referencing in the PeriodIndex, the bug in the `_engine` function could be causing the weak reference to be lost prematurely.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly create and maintain the weak reference to the `self` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref'):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we check if a weak reference attribute `_period_ref` exists on the instance. If it doesn't exist, we create a weak reference to `self` and store it in the `_period_ref` attribute. Then we pass this weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor. This approach ensures that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained throughout the function's lifetime. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
