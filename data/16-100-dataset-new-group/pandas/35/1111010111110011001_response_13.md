For the buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class, the main issue appears to be with the weak referencing. The function is attempting to create a reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`, but the returned weak reference is not being correctly captured as a reference to the Period object.

To fix the bug:
1. Explicitly capture the weak reference to `self` as a Period object by calling the `period()` method on the weak reference. This will return the referenced object as a Period object if it still exists, or None if it has been garbage collected.
2. Check if the weak reference is still alive before attempting to use it, and handle the case where it has been garbage collected (None).

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case where the weak reference has been garbage collected
        # Return an appropriate value, or raise an error if needed
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self has been garbage collected")
```

This modification should ensure that the weak referencing works correctly and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
