The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` file to raise an AttributeError.

The cause of the bug is that the function is intended to return the engine type for the period index, but it is failing to return the correct type, leading to a 'NoneType' error being raised when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, the function `_engine` needs to be modified to correctly return the engine type for the period index. We can remove the weakref usage and instead directly return the engine type. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This modified version eliminates the usage of weakref and directly returns the engine type using `self` and the length of the period index. This should resolve the AttributeError and allow the failing test to pass.
