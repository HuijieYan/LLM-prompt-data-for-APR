The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the use of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `self._engine_type`. This can lead to an incorrect reference cycle handling.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the weak reference is used properly and that the `self` object is being handled correctly within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `weakref.proxy` is used instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. This will prevent the reference cycle issue and should resolve the bug.

With this correction, the provided failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
