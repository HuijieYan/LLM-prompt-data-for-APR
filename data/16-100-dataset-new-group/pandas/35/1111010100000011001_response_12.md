#### Analysis
The function `_engine` seems to be using the `cache_readonly` decorator to cache the result of the `_engine_type` method. The `weakref.ref` is used to create a weak reference to the `self` object to avoid reference cycles.

#### Bug
The bug in this function is that the `weakref.ref` is being assigned to a local variable `period` but not being used in the subsequent call to `_engine_type`. This means that the weak reference is not being utilized, and there is a risk of a reference cycle.

#### Fix
To fix the bug, we should actually use the weak reference `period` when calling the `_engine_type` method.

#### Corrected code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
