The issue with the buggy function is that it returns the result of self._engine_type which initially passes a weak reference of self into _engine_type, but the weak reference doesn't persist.

One way to fix this bug is to change the implementation of the _engine function to ensure the weak reference is maintained throughout the function's execution.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)

    def engine_wrapper(ref, length):
      if ref() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(ref, length)

    return engine_wrapper(period, len(self))
```
