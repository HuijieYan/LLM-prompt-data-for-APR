Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex and the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is causing the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute of a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex is properly maintained and that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the self object. This ensures that the PeriodEngine receives a valid reference to the PeriodIndex and prevents the NoneType AttributeError that was occurring earlier.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex.
