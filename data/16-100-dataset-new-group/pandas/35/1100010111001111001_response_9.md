The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function is that it is using weakref in an incorrect way. The weakref.ref should be used to create a weak reference to the object, but it is not being used properly.

A potential fix for this bug is to create a weak reference to the period index object and then pass it as an argument to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should properly create a weak reference to the period index object and pass it to `_engine_type`, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
