Since the issue is related to dropping the weakly referenced PeriodIndex before intended, the bug is likely in the _engine function. The weakref.ref(self) call is creating a weak reference to self, but it's not being used properly. This causes the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the issue described in the GitHub report.

To fix the bug, we need to use the weak reference properly when creating the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected function, we create a weak reference to self using weakref.ref(self) and store it in a variable period_ref. Then, we pass period_ref to the _engine_type instead of directly passing self.

This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and provide the expected output for the failing test case.
