## Analysis:
The `_engine` function is decorated with `@cache_readonly` which suggests that it should return a cached result upon first call and use that result for subsequent calls. However, it is not clear how `self._engine_type` is being used and whether it correctly handles the caching. The potential error in the code is that the weak reference `period` may not be working as intended and the caching of the result may be inconsistent.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect caching behavior of the `_engine` function. The weak reference `period` may not correctly preserve the reference to `self` in a way that ensures consistent caching. This could lead to unexpected behavior when the function is called multiple times.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can directly use a cached result and ensure that it is returned upon subsequent calls. We should also avoid using weak references if they are not necessary for memory management purposes. Additionally, we may need to check how `self._engine_type` handles caching to ensure that the correct behavior is implemented.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
        self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(self, len(self))
    return self._cached_engine
```
