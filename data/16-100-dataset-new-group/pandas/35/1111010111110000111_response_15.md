The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class causes a weak reference to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This bug causes the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to raise an `AttributeError` due to the weak reference issue.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is preserved until it is intended to be dropped.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    period().engine = weakref.ref(engine)
    return engine
```
