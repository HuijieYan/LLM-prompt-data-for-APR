The buggy function `_engine` is not properly creating a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This results in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the function `_engine` needs to create a proper weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of just `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly dereferenced and passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue where `PeriodEngine` receives a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
