The bug in the given function is that it is not properly creating a weak reference to the `self` object. This is causing a reference cycle and potential memory leaks.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `weakref.ref` method to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then pass that weak reference to the `_engine_type` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
