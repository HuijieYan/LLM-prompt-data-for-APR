The issue with the provided code is that the weak reference to the `self` object is being lost before intended. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, resulting in the failing test case. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is not lost prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` receives it, preventing the premature loss of the weak reference.

With this correction, the failing test case should pass, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
