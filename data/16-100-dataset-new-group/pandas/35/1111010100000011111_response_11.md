## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then initializing an `PeriodEngine` object using this weak reference. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is being dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained for the lifetime of the `PeriodEngine` and not dropped prematurely.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py
from pandas.core.indexes.numeric import Int64Index

@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Corrected implementation of the _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a weak reference to self
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        
        def period_engine_creator(period_ref, size):
            return self._engine_type(period_ref, size)
        
        # Use a local function to maintain the reference to self
        return period_engine_creator(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, we create a local function `period_engine_creator` to maintain the reference to `self` using the weak reference. This ensures that the reference to `self` is not dropped prematurely and is available for the entire lifetime of the `PeriodEngine`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
