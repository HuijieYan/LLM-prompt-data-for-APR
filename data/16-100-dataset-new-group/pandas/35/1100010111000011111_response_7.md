```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self.levels))

```
In the corrected version, the len(self) has been replaced with len(self.levels) to ensure that the correct length is passed as the second argument to self._engine_type. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected in the failing test case.
