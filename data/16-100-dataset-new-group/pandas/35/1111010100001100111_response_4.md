The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an issue where weakrefs are being lost, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This issue is related to the copying of `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` resulting in the loss of weakrefs.

The cause of the bug is the use of weakrefs and the way the `_engine` function is returning the result. It seems that the weak reference to `self` is being passed to the `_engine_type`, but it is not being maintained properly, resulting in `None` being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained so that it doesn't get lost during the execution of the function. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` always receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is now explicitly called as a function (`period()`), which ensures that it returns the actual object referenced by the weak reference, preventing the loss of weakrefs.
