The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing the `PeriodEngine` to return a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `i8` view. This is leading to an AttributeError when the `is_monotonic` property is accessed.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct type of object, and that the `PeriodEngine` is properly created and initialized to avoid returning a `NoneType` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
    else:
        return engine
```

By adding a condition to check if the `engine` is `None`, we can ensure that a new `PeriodEngine` is created when necessary, preventing the AttributeError encountered in the failing test case.
