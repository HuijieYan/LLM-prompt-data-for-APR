The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function returns a `NoneType` object, which causes an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that it returns the correct type of object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `self._engine_type` is not `None` before returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. If `self._engine_type` is `None`, it will return `None` instead. This will prevent the AttributeError from occurring and fix the bug.
