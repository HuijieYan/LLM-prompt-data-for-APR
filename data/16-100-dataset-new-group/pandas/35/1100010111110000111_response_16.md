The issue appears to be related to weak referencing where the `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function does not maintain a reference to the `self` object. As a result, when accessing `x.is_monotonic` in the failing test, it leads to a `NoneType` attribute error because the expected object is not being weakly referenced as intended.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to correctly maintain a weak reference to `self`. We can use a lambda function to capture a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period(), len(self))
```

By using a lambda function to capture the weak reference to `self` and then passing it to the `_engine_type` method, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout the process.

This fix should allow the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to pass without raising the `NoneType` attribute error, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
