The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the weak reference not being properly used to create the period object. This can cause the `_engine_type` to receive a `None` value instead of the expected `period` object.

To fix the bug, we need to properly create and use the weak reference to avoid the reference cycle and ensure that the `period` object is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we create a weak reference to `self` and ensure that the `period` object passed to `_engine_type` is not `None`, resolving the AttributeError issue in the failing test.
