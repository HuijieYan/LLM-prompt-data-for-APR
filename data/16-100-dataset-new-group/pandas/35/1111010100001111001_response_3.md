The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the _engine method, which is a cache_readonly method of the PeriodIndex class. The cache_readonly decorator caches the result of the method, so it is possible that the bug is causing incorrect caching of the _engine result.

The expected behavior of the _engine method is to return an instance of _engine_type initialized with a weak reference to self (the PeriodIndex object) and the length of the PeriodIndex.

One potential cause of the bug in the _engine method is that the weakref.ref method may not be correctly capturing a weak reference to the self object.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to self is being captured correctly and that the _engine method is returning the correct instance of _engine_type.

Here is the corrected version of the _engine method:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we capture the weak reference to self using the weakref.ref method, and then we return the instance of _engine_type with the weak reference and the length of the PeriodIndex.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the _engine method returns the correct instance of _engine_type as expected.
