The buggy function `_engine` is experiencing an attribute error because `weakref.ref` is not properly handling the `self` parameter, leading to a reference cycle issue.

To fix the bug, it's recommended to use a combination of weak reference and factory function to avoid the reference cycle.

The corrected version of the `_engine` function is provided below:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    def engine_factory(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    return engine_factory(period, len(self))
```
