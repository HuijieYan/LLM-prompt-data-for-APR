The buggy function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator to cache the result of the `_engine` function. However, it is likely that the weakref is not being stored correctly, leading to the `NoneType` error when trying to access the weakref.

The bug is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the view of a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, the weakref should be stored properly so that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = self._period_weakref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weakref to `self` is stored as an attribute `_period_weakref` of the object, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub and enable the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to pass correctly.
