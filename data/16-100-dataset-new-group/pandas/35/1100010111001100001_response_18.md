The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the `weakref` usage. The `weakref` module allows the creation of weak references to objects, which means it does not increase the reference count of the object it points to, thus avoiding circular references.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function, it seems that the `weakref.ref` is being used incorrectly. The `weakref.ref` function is used to create a weak reference to an object, but it should be used with the object itself, not its value. In this case, it should be used with `self` instead of `self._values`.

A potential fix for the bug is to use `weakref.ref` with `self` instead of `self._values`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This should fix the bug and make the test pass.
