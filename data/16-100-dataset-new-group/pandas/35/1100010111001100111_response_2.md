To fix the bug in the _engine function, we need to ensure that the weakref reference to self is maintained until it is no longer needed by the _engine_type. The bug causes the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before it is supposed to, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

We can fix this by modifying the _engine function to store the weakref reference to self in a variable and then pass that reference to the _engine_type. This will ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is retained until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weakref of self to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex will be retained until it is no longer needed, fixing the bug and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

This should result in the test_get_level_values_when_periods test passing successfully.

The corrected version of the _engine function will address the GitHub issue and fix the bug.
