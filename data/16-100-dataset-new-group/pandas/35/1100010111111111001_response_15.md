The bug in the _engine function lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. The weakref.ref() function returns a weak reference to the object, which means that it may return None if the object has been garbage collected. This is evident from the error message which states "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'", indicating that the weak reference is returning None and causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be used to create a strong reference within the _engine function to prevent the period object from being garbage collected. This can be done using the `weakref.proxy()` function.

Here is the corrected version of the _engine function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.proxy(self)  # Use weak reference proxy to create a strong reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
This change ensures that a strong reference to the period object is maintained within the _engine function, preventing the weak reference from returning None and causing the AttributeError.
