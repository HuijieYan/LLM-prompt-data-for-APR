The buggy function `_engine` is a cache readonly property of the `PeriodIndex` class, which is supposed to return a new instance of the `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and its length. The `_engine_type` is expected to be a class attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class.

The potential error in the `_engine` function is the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This can cause issues with garbage collection and weak reference behavior in the context of the `_engine_type` usage.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function, which may lead to unexpected behavior when creating weak references to the `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor without creating a weak reference. Since `PeriodIndex` is already part of the `pandas` library, we can safely assume that `_engine_type` is a valid attribute or method available in the `PeriodIndex` class.

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # other class code...

    # corrected version of the _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, we avoid the unnecessary creation of a weak reference and ensure that the `_engine` function behaves as expected.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
