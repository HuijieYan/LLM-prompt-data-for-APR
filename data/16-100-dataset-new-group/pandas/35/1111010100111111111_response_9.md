The bug in the `_engine` function causes an AttributeError due to a NoneType object that is being accessed. This is likely because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not lost prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self, engine._cleanup)
    return engine
```

In this corrected version, we create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex and then use the weak reference to create the engine. We also attach a cleanup function to the weak reference, ensuring that it doesn't get dropped prematurely.

This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output from the failing test case.
