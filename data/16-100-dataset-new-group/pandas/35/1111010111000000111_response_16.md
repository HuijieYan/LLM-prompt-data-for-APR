The issue appears to be related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` indicates that weak references are lost when copying the `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not maintained properly within the `_engine` function, causing it to be lost when copying the `PeriodIndex` levels.

To fix this bug, the strategy would be to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def create_engine(period_ref, length):
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, length)
    
    return create_engine(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is passed as an argument to the `create_engine` function, which then creates the `_engine` object with the weak reference intact.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test.
