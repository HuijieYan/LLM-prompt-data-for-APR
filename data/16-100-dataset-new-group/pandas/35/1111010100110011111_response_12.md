To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained properly. The error message indicates that the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The cause of the bug is related to weak reference handling in the `_engine_type` method. It seems that the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` instance) is not being properly maintained, leading to it being dropped prematurely. This results in the `_engine` method returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference to `self` using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`. This will ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is not dropped prematurely, and the `_engine` method returns the correct `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained, and the `_engine` method will return the correct `PeriodIndex` object.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the `_engine` method behaves as expected.
