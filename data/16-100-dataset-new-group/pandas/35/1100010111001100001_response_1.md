The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`, but it is not actually using the weak reference when calling `_engine_type`. This can lead to a reference cycle and potential memory leaks.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to use the weak reference when calling `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we call `period()` to obtain the referenced object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

This fix ensures that a weak reference to `self` is being used as intended, avoiding potential reference cycles.

With the corrected code, the failing test should now pass as the potential memory leaks are resolved.
