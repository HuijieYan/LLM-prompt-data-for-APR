The expected values and types of the variables at the return of the buggy function for the failing test case are:

- `period`: weak reference to `self` of type `weakref.ref`
- Return: An instance of `_engine_type` initialized with `period` and `len(self)` of type `PeriodEngine`

The bug in the `_engine` function is that `period` is being assigned a weak reference to `self`, but the `weakref.ref` function is not being called correctly. Also, the `_engine_type` is not receiving the correct arguments. 

To fix this bug, the correct way to use `weakref.ref` is to call the function with `self` as an argument. Then, pass `period()` and `len(self)` as arguments to `_engine_type` to correctly initialize the `_engine` with the weak reference and length.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
