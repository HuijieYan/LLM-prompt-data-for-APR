There are a few issues with the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message suggests that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected PeriodIndex. This is due to weak reference being dropped before intended. This bug is also reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `self` PeriodIndex object should be managed appropriately. Additionally, the `_engine` function should return the expected PeriodIndex object to resolve the 'NoneType' error.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    def engine_type(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    
    return engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

This version ensures that a weak reference to the `self` PeriodIndex object is passed to the `_engine_type` function correctly. This should resolve the 'NoneType' error as reported in the failing test.
