## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to `self` within the `PeriodIndex` class. This is intended to prevent a reference cycle, but the weak reference is getting dropped before it's intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`. The `weakref.ref(self)` weak reference needs to be maintained throughout the lifetime of `_engine`.

## Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by storing the weak reference in an instance variable to ensure that the reference is not dropped prematurely.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    Parameters

    """

    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, month=None, quarter=None, day=None, hour=None, minute=None, second=None, tz=None, dtype=None):
        # Initialize the weak reference to None
        self._period_ref = None
        super().__init__(data, copy=copy, freq=freq, year=year, month=month, quarter=quarter, day=day, hour=hour, minute=minute, second=second, tz=tz, dtype=dtype)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # If the weak reference is None, create one
        if self._period_ref is None:
            self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

This corrected version creates an instance variable `_period_ref` to hold the weak reference to `self`. It ensures that the weak reference is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` function to prevent premature dropping. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
