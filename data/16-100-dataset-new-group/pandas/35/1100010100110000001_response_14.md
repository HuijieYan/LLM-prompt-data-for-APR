The buggy function `_engine` appears to be related to the failing test due to an AttributeError, particularly with the `vgetter().view("i8")` section. 

The potential error location within the buggy function is at the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line. It seems that `self._engine_type` is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The bug is caused by the `_engine` function not properly initializing or returning a valid `_engine_type` object, which results in `NoneType` being returned.

The strategy for fixing the bug should be to ensure that the `_engine` function properly initializes and returns a valid `_engine_type` object, avoiding the `NoneType` object that causes the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        # handle the case when _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
```
