## Bug Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of a specific type, `PeriodEngine`, initialized with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, due to a reference cycle issue, the weak reference is not correctly preserved in the `PeriodEngine`. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_engine` function where the weak reference is not preserved as intended.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is not correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`, resulting in the `NoneType` error when accessing attributes of the weak reference.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance needs to be correctly preserved and passed to the `PeriodEngine` to ensure that it receives the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Correction of the Buggy Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
In this corrected version, the weak reference `period` is called as a function `period()` to obtain the actual reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance before passing it to the `PeriodEngine`. This ensures that the weak reference is correctly preserved and used in the `PeriodEngine`.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
