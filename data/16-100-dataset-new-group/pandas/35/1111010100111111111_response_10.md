To fix the bug, we will modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained. We will also handle the case where the PeriodIndex is no longer available and replace it with a default value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def engine_type(period, length):
        if period is not None:
            return self._engine_type(period, length)
        else:
            return self._engine_type(None, length)  # Replace with default value
    
    return engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we have created a nested function `engine_type` that takes the weak reference to the PeriodIndex and its length as parameters. Inside this function, we handle the case where the weak reference is no longer available and replace it with a default value.

By making these changes, the function should now maintain the weak reference to the PeriodIndex and handle cases where the reference is lost.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test case.
