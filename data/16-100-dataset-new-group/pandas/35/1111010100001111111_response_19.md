To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped before intended, so that the `PeriodEngine` does not receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The bug is likely caused by the weak reference to `self` being immediately dropped after its creation in the `_engine` function. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to hold a strong reference to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` until the `PeriodEngine` is created.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Hold a strong reference to the weakly referenced self until the engine is created
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
    period_index = period_ref()
    if period_index is not None:
        return engine_type
    else:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create PeriodEngine due to dropped weak reference to PeriodIndex")
```

In this corrected version, we create a strong reference `period_ref` to the weakly referenced `self`. We then create the `engine_type` using `period_ref` and check if the `period_index` is not None. If it is not None, we return the `engine_type`. Otherwise, we raise a `ValueError` indicating that the creation of `PeriodEngine` failed due to a dropped weak reference to `PeriodIndex`. This approach ensures that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely.
