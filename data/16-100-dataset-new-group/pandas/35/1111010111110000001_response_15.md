The bug is likely to be caused by the `_engine` method, which is being used in `idx2 = MultiIndex.from_arrays([idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)])`. The failing test message shows an AttributeError for `NoneType` and the methods leading to that call are in the `is_monotonic` method, which leads to the `_do_monotonic_check` and subsequently the `_get_index_values` method.

The error indicates that the `_engine` method returns `None` instead of an instance of `PeriodEngine`, meaning that the method fails to create a new `PeriodEngine` instance and assign it to `self._engine`. 

To fix the bug, you would need to ensure that the `_engine` method produces a new instance of `PeriodEngine` and assigns it to `self._engine`. The corrected version of the `_engine` method is shown below:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        return self._engine
```
