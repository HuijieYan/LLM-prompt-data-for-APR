### Explanation
The bug occurs because the `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference to the object, but the reference is not being dereferenced when passed to `self._engine_type()`. This leads to an attribute error when trying to call the `vgetter()` method on a weak reference object.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we can dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `self._engine_type()`. This can be done by calling the `period()` method on the weak reference object.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a dereferenced weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
