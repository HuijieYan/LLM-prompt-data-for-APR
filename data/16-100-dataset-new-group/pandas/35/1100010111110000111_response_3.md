The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is using weakref to create a weak reference to `self`, but it seems that the weak reference is not being utilized correctly, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object and then attempting to access the `view` attribute, which does not exist. This is likely due to the weak reference not being properly maintained.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be correctly utilized so that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to `self` and does not encounter the `NoneType` error.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
Using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` ensures that a valid reference to `self` is passed to the `_engine_type`, preventing the `NoneType` error.

By using `weakref.proxy`, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained properly, resolving the issue where the `PeriodEngine` receives a `NoneType` object.

This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
