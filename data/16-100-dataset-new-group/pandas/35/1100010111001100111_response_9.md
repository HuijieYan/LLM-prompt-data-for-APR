The bug in the `_engine` function is related to weak referencing, and the issue is causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the intended PeriodIndex. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex is handled properly to avoid dropping the weakly referenced PeriodIndex prematurely.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex that is not prematurely dropped, resolving the issue with weak referencing.

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
