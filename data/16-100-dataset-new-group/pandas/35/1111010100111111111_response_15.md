The issue describes a problem where weakly referenced PeriodIndex drops before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to get a None instead of the PeriodIndex and resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute.

Based on the error message and the expected output, it seems that the `_engine` function is not properly creating the weak reference to the PeriodIndex, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None value instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is correctly created and maintained within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to ensure that if the weak reference `period` is not None, the `_engine_type` is initialized with the weak reference and the length of the PeriodIndex. If the weak reference is None, it returns None.

By adding this check, we can prevent the AttributeError caused by the None value being passed to the `_engine_type`. This fix should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.
