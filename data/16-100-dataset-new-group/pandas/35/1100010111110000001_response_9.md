The issue seems to be related to the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file, which is used when retrieving the level values in the failing test (`test_get_level_values_when_periods`).

The `_engine` function uses a decorator `@cache_readonly`, which suggests that it's intended to be a cached readonly property. However, the implementation of the `_engine` function seems to be incorrect, as it returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without any proper implementation to cache or retain the return value.

The error message from the failing test indicates an AttributeError when trying to access the view method on a `NoneType` object, suggesting that the `_engine` function is not returning the expected value, resulting in a `NoneType`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be re-implemented to correctly cache and return the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` using the `@cache_readonly` decorator.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._cached_engine
```
With this correction, the function checks if the cached engine is present and returns it if it is, otherwise it calculates and caches the engine before returning it.

This corrected implementation should resolve the AttributeError issue and allow the failing test to pass.
