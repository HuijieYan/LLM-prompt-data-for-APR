The buggy function `_engine` seems to be attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and then use it to invoke some method `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

The potential error in the code seems to be the use of `weakref.ref(self)` as it's not clear what `self._engine_type` is doing and whether it's expecting `weakref` objects or not.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from an array of `PeriodIndex` and then attempts to check if the levels of the newly created `MultiIndex` are monotonic.

The cause of the bug could be that the `_engine` function is not returning the correct result, leading to issues when creating `MultiIndex` objects.

A strategy for fixing the bug could be to make sure that `_engine` function returns the expected result for `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, and that it is compatible with the usage of `weakref` objects.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference, and then return the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This should ensure that the correct reference is passed to `_engine_type` and that it can operate on it properly.
