The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the use of weakref. The weakref.ref(self) creates a weak reference to the self object, and this weak reference is then passed to the `_engine_type` function. It seems that the intention is to prevent a reference cycle, but the implementation is incorrect.

The test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is failing. It looks like the test is creating a `MultiIndex` from an array of `PeriodIndex` objects and expecting the resulting `idx2` to have monotonic levels.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect use of `weakref.ref(self)`. This creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self`, but it is not being used correctly when passed to `_engine_type`. This incorrect usage of weak references may be causing the `_engine_type` function to not receive the expected input, which could lead to incorrect behavior and cause the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
Since weak references are used to avoid reference cycles, it's important to ensure that the weak reference is being used properly. In this case, it seems that the weak reference should be dereferenced before being passed to `_engine_type`. This can be done using the `weakref.proxy()` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we can create a weak proxy to the `self` object, which can be safely passed to `_engine_type` without causing reference cycle issues. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
