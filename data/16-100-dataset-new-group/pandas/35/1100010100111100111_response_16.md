## Fixing the buggy function

The issue seems to be related to losing weakrefs when copying a `PeriodIndex` into a `MultiIndex`. This is causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `NoneType` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not lost when it is copied to a `MultiIndex`.

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By ensuring that the weak reference `period` is maintained when passing it to `_engine_type`, we can prevent the PeriodEngine from receiving a NoneType and resolve the AttributeError. This approach should fix the bug and address the failing test as described in the GitHub issue.
