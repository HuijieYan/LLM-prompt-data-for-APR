## Correction

The buggy function is using weakrefs but is not being used correctly, causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly utilize weakrefs and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the intended PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref(), len(self))
```
