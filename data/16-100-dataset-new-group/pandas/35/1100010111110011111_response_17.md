To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly to avoid it being dropped prematurely. In the original code, the weak reference `period` is not used anywhere, and it seems that the `_engine_type` function is not handling weak references correctly.

We can modify the code to create a weak reference and then use it when calling `_engine_type`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Use the weak reference when calling _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This modification ensures that `period` is used to reference `self` when calling `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
