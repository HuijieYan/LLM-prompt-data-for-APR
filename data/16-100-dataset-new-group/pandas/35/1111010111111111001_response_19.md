The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is that the weak reference `period` is not being properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, resulting in a `NoneType` error when attempting to access the `view` attribute. This is likely due to the weak reference not being properly maintained by the Python garbage collector, resulting in the `_engine_type` constructor receiving a `None` value instead of a valid `Period` object.

To fix this bug, a more robust method of maintaining the weak reference to `self` is necessary. This could involve using a custom context manager to manage the weak reference, ensuring that its validity is preserved during the construction of the `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function for the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a context manager to properly maintain the weak reference to self
    class WeakRefManager:
        def __enter__(self):
            self.period = weakref.ref(self)
            return self.period

        def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
            pass

    with WeakRefManager() as period:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference `period` is properly maintained by the context manager, allowing it to remain valid during the construction of the `_engine_type` object.

With this fix, the `_engine` function should now properly create the `_engine_type` object and avoid the `NoneType` error that was causing the failing test.
