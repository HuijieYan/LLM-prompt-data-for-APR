To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained and not dropped before it's intended. The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected PeriodIndex, which is causing the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we are calling `period()` to obtain the reference to the object that `period` is weakly referencing. This ensures that the weakref remains valid and doesn't resolve to None unexpectedly.

This change should resolve the AttributeError and ensure that the function behaves as expected, passing the failing test case and satisfying the expected input/output values.
