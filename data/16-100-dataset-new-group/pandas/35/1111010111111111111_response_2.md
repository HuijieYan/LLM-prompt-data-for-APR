The issue seems to be related to weakref not being used correctly in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `view` method is being called on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is being lost, resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` should be maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we are creating a weak proxy to the `PeriodIndex` instance. This will help maintain the weak reference throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` object, preventing it from being lost prematurely.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
