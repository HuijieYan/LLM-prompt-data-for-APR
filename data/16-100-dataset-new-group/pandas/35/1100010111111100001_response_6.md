The cause of the bug is that the `_engine_type` function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type, leading to an AttributeError when the program tries to call the `view` method on it. This is likely due to the weak reference not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we should handle the weak reference properly and ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns the correct type of object.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By removing the `weakref.ref(self)` and directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` function, we can avoid the weak reference issue and ensure the correct type of object is returned.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the AttributeError issue and pass the failing test.
