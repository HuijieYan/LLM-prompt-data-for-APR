The problem arises in the `PeriodIndex` class due to the method `_engine`, which is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator to cache the result of the `_engine_type` method call. However, the `_engine_type` method call is expecting a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, but the method is returning `None` instead.

To fix this issue, the `_engine` method should be modified to return a weak reference to the current `PeriodIndex` instance itself.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

In this correction, an additional check is performed to ensure that the `_engine_type` method is not `None` before attempting to call it.

With this corrected `_engine` method, the issue with the failing test should be resolved and the corrected version of the method should now pass the test.
