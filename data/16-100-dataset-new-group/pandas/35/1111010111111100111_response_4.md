To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, the issue appears to be related to weak referencing. It seems that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` er dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To resolve this, we can update the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference is maintained until after it's used in the `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To maintain the weak reference until after its usage in PeriodEngine
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

By maintaining the weak reference until after its usage in `PeriodEngine`, we ensure that the reference to `self` is valid when used by the engine.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes as expected. This will also address the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` losing weak references.
