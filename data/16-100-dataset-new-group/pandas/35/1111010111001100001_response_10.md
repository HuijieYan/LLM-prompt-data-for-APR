The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which is intended to be used for caching the return value of a property or method. However, the function is trying to create a weak reference to `self` and return the result of `_engine_type`, which is likely a different type than expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not returning the expected type of output, causing the failing test to fail.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should return the result of `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference to `self`. Additionally, the `cache_readonly` decorator should be removed as it's not appropriate for this context.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
After making this change, the corrected function should return the expected type of output and pass the failing test.
