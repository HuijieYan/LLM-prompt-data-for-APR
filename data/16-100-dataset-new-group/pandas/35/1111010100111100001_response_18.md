The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing the `NoneType` attribute error when trying to access the view property. The `_engine` function appears to be returning `None` instead of the expected engine type, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct engine type instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

By checking if `self._engine_type` is not None before returning the engine type, we can prevent the function from returning `None` and ensure that the correct engine type is returned.

This should fix the bug causing the `NoneType` attribute error and ensure that the `_engine` function returns the expected engine type.
