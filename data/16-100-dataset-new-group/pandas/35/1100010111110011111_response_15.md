The buggy function `_engine` is failing to return the expected output because it is not correctly handling the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `view("i8")` attribute of the `PeriodEngine` object.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not being correctly passed to the `_engine_type`, resulting in a `NoneType` object being accessed instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` and that the weak reference is appropriately handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

In the corrected version, we are now calling the weak reference object returned by `weakref.ref(self)` using `()`, which returns the actual `PeriodIndex` object instead of the weak reference when passed to `_engine_type`.

This fix should resolve the issue and ensure that the `is_monotonic` test in the failing test case passes and returns `True` as the expected output.
