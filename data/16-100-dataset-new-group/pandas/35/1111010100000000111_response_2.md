Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function, it seems that the issue is related to weak references being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in the error when checking for monotonicity.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely and is accessible to the PeriodEngine. This can be achieved by modifying the _engine function to correctly handle the weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
The change here is to use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained throughout the execution of the _engine function.

With this corrected version, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex will not be dropped prematurely, and the PeriodEngine will receive the correct reference to the PeriodIndex, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
