The issue is likely related to the `_engine_type` method, where a `weakref` to the period is passed. The bug is likely caused by not properly handling the weak reference.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled and used within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
