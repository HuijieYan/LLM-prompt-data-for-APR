The given buggy function is a method in the `pandas.core.indexes.period` module. It appears that the function is part of the codebase that supports handling period indexes in pandas.

The `_engine` method in the buggy function is decorating a method with `@cache_readonly`. The function returns the result of creating a new instance of the `self._engine_type` class, using `weakref.ref(self)` as the first argument and `len(self)` as the second argument.

The failing test, `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, fails at the assertion `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)`. This assertion checks if all level values in `idx2` are monotonic.

The error message indicates an `AttributeError` in the `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` file, specifically with the message "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'". This is indicative of a failure in the `_do_monotonic_check` method in the `IndexEngine` class.

Given this information, it seems that the bug might be related to the behavior of the cached engine object. This could result in the engine object being unexpectedly `None` when accessed, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_engine` method to properly instantiate and return the engine object when called.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine_instance') or self._engine_instance() is None:
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_instance
```
In the corrected version, we check if the `_engine_instance` attribute exists and if it's not `None`. If it doesn't exist or is `None`, we create a new instance using `self._engine_type` and store it in `_engine_instance`. Otherwise, we return the existing `_engine_instance`.

With this correction, the `_engine` method should instantiate and return the engine object properly, fixing the bug and causing the failing test to pass.
