```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Fixing the bug requires ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function. Potentially, the weak reference is being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` as intended.

The corrected version of the function should maintain the weak reference to `self` until the `PeriodEngine` is created and passed the reference.

This fix should address the issue posted in GitHub and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
