The error is likely due to an issue with the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function. The weakness of the reference may be causing it to become a `NoneType`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to use a strong reference to `self` instead of a weak reference.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By using a strong reference to `self`, we can ensure that the `self._engine_type` method can access all the necessary attributes and methods associated with `self`, without running into issues with weak references becoming `NoneType`. This should resolve the AttributeError that was observed in the failing test.
