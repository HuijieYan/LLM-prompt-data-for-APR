The buggy function is `_engine(self)` and it is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The purpose of this function is to create and return an instance of `self._engine_type`, which is an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class. The expected behavior is that the `_engine` function will use the provided weak reference of `self` and create an instance of `self._engine_type`.

The error message indicates that an attribute error occurred. Specifically, it states that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This error occurs in the code because the function `_engine` is returning `None` while some other part of the code is trying to access attributes or methods of this `None` object.

Analysis of the buggy function reveals that the issue lies in the return statement of the `_engine` function. The return statement is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` which suggests that either `self._engine_type` is `None` or `period` or `len(self)` is producing an unexpected value.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function needs to be modified to ensure that it returns a valid instance of `self._engine_type`. This may involve checking the initialization of the `self._engine_type` attribute or ensuring that the weak reference `period` is being passed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        if self._engine_type is not None:
            return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        else:
            raise ValueError("Engine type is not initialized.")
```

This corrected version includes a check for the existence of `self._engine_type` and raises an error if it's not initialized. This will prevent the function from returning `None` and triggering the attribute error.
