### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method in the `PeriodIndex` class that returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` and the length of self.

### Identifying potential error locations
The potential error location is in the implementation of the `_engine` function, specifically where it returns the result of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it uses a weak reference to `self` to avoid a reference cycle. However, this implementation might not be necessary and could lead to incorrect behavior when creating an instance of `_engine_type`.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
It seems that using a weak reference to `self` in this context might not be necessary or appropriate. Instead, a direct reference to `self` should be used when creating an instance of `_engine_type`. Additionally, the usage of `len(self)` might also need to be reviewed.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
