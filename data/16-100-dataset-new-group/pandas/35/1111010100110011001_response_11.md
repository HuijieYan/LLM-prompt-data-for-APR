The cause of the bug is that the `_engine_type` function is not returning a valid type, resulting in an AttributeError when calling the `view` method on a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that a valid type is returned by the `_engine_type` function.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @property
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine is not None:
            return engine
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid engine type")
```

By checking that the `engine` is not None, we can ensure that a valid type is returned and eliminate the AttributeError.
