The bug in the `_engine` function is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `period` is a weak reference and `self._engine_type` appears to be a method returning a new instance. This is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to create a strong reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`. Also, we need to return the weakly referenced period to avoid a reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(period), len(self))
```
By creating a strong reference to `self` and passing a weak reference to `_engine_type`, we can avoid the issue of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
