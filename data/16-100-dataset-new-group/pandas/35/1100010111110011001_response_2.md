The buggy function `_engine` is trying to use a weak reference of `self` to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems to be causing an issue with the `_engine_type` method. The error message indicates that `self._engine_type` is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, we can consider updating the `_engine` function to properly create a weak reference and handle any potential issues with the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference to avoid reference cycles
    period_weak_ref = weakref.ref(self)

    # Perform a check to avoid NoneType object
    if self._engine_type is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period_weak_ref, len(self))
    else:
        # Replace with appropriate handling when _engine_type is None
        return None
```
