The parameter values and types for the failing test function are as follows:
- idx: MultiIndex object with levels containing Period objects

The buggy function `_engine` returns an instance of `self._engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine_type` method does not accept a weak reference to `self` as a parameter, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of the weak reference. 

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should pass a reference to `self` directly to the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` method, the weak reference issue is resolved.

With this correction, the `_engine` function will now return an instance of `self._engine_type` initialized with a direct reference to `self` and the length of `self`. This should resolve the AttributeError when accessing the weak reference attribute in the failing test.
