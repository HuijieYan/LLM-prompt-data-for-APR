The buggy function `_engine` is failing to return the expected output and causing an AttributeError during test execution due to a weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended. The function is supposed to avoid a reference cycle by passing a weakref of `self` to `_engine_type`, but it is not handling weak references correctly, leading to a NoneType object error.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to correctly handle weak references and ensure that the period is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by updating the weakref creation and retrieval process within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to self
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Retrieve the weak reference and check if it's still available
    period = weak_self()
    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weakly referenced period is no longer available")
```

By creating and retrieving the weak reference correctly, the corrected function ensures that the period is not dropped prematurely, avoiding the NoneType object error.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the bug.
