The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function is that the weakref of `self` is not being handled correctly, leading to a `NoneType` object being returned instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object. This causes an `AttributeError` when the `vgetter` method is called on a `NoneType` object. The expected output is for the function to correctly return the `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix the bug, the weakref of `self` should be handled properly to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is retained and passed correctly to the `_engine_type` constructor.

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, the weak reference to `self` is handled properly and the `PeriodIndex` object is retained, resolving the bug. This change should ensure that the function returns the correct `PeriodIndex` object and passes the failing test.
