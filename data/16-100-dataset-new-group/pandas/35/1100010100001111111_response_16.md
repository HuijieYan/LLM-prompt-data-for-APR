The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. However, it is not being used properly, leading to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to properly use `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and ensure that it is retained until the `PeriodEngine` is done using it.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Create a weak reference to the self object
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))  # Pass the weak reference to the PeriodEngine
```
