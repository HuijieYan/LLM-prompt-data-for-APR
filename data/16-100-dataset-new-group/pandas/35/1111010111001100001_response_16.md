The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and then return the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The usage of weak references is to avoid potential reference cycles and memory leaks, but it seems that the implementation is causing issues. As a result, the failing test demonstrates that there are problems when creating a PeriodIndex with a MultiIndex and getting the level values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to the creation of the weak reference to `self`. When the weak reference is used in `_engine_type(period, len(self))`, it might not be correctly resolving the reference to `self`, leading to unexpected behavior and failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should avoid using weak references and instead directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` to avoid the potential reference cycle issues. This should ensure that the weak reference is not interfering with the correct resolution of `self` within the `_engine_type` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
