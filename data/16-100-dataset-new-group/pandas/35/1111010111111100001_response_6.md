The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing an `AttributeError` when the `is_monotonic` method is called. This is due to the `PeriodEngine` class not being properly instantiated.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function needs to be modified to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` class is properly initialized and returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period=period, length=len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the `PeriodEngine` class is properly instantiated with the `period` and `length` arguments. This should fix the `AttributeError` and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes.
