The bug in the provided function `_engine` lies in the weakref implementation. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is getting dropped before it should, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` should be maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    ... (other details unchanged)


    # this is the fixed version
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)  # maintain a weak reference to the period
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object will be held until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, and the failing test should now pass without raising an error.
