The cause of the bug is that the `_engine_type` is returning `None` for the `PeriodIndex` instance, and thus the AttributeError is raised when trying to access the `view` attribute on `NoneType`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns the correct type of object, and not `None`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        return self._default_engine()
    return engine
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function will return the default engine if the `_engine_type` method returns `None`, ensuring that the AttributeError is not raised.
