To fix the bug, the issue is likely due to the fact that the `_engine` is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The `self` object is being passed as a weak reference, but it seems that when weak references are involved, there's a possibility of the object not being available and a `NoneType` error occurs.

To resolve this issue, I would suggest creating an actual reference to `self` and use that within the `_engine` function, instead of using a weakref.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

Using an actual reference to `self` ensures that the object is available when the `_engine` function is called, preventing the `NoneType` error.
