### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute. This is likely due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, which results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` method is supposed to return the `_engine_type` with a weakly referenced `self` (the PeriodIndex instance) as a parameter. However, due to the weak reference implementation, the reference to `self` is being dropped prematurely, leading to a `NoneType` being returned and causing the attribute error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, it's necessary to modify the weak reference implementation or directly referencing the `self` instance to ensure that the weak reference is kept alive until it's no longer needed.

### Bug Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we pass a proxy of `self` to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference, ensuring that the reference is kept alive until it's no longer needed. This should resolve the premature dropping of the weak reference and prevent the NoneType object from being returned.
