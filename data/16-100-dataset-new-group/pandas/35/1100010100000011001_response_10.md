#### Expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
- period: weak reference to self
- Return value: an instance of _engine_type

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function is the misuse of the weakref.ref() function. This function is used to create a weak reference to the object 'self', but it is currently being passed as an argument directly to self._engine_type(). This can lead to a potential reference cycle, as the weak reference is not being properly utilized to avoid it.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly utilize the weak reference by dereferencing it before passing it as an argument to self._engine_type(). This will ensure that the weak reference is properly handled and will not lead to a reference cycle.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a dereferenced weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
