The buggy function is the `_engine` method in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. It is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class.

The failing test is `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`. The test is trying to create an assertion that checks whether the level values in the `idx2` multi-index are monotonic.

The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` raised in the `PeriodEngine` class, which is related to the failing assertion in the test.

The cause of this bug is that the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing the attribute error in the `PeriodEngine`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method needs to be modified to ensure that it returns a valid object of the correct type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

With this correction, the `_engine` method will return a valid object, or `None` if `_engine_type` is `None`. This should ensure that the failing test does not raise an attribute error.
