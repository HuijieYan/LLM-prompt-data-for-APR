### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it's not being used correctly. This is causing an error when accessing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object, leading to a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

### Error location
The error is likely occurring in the `_engine` function where it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. Since `weakref.ref` is used incorrectly to create a weak reference to `self`, it might be leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` in creating a weak reference to `self`. This causes the weak reference not to receive the original object, resulting in a `NoneType` error when attempting to access attributes or methods from the weakly referenced object.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by properly using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. This will allow the weak reference to correctly reference the `self` object and prevent the `NoneType` error when accessing attributes or methods from the weakly referenced object.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _engine(self):
        # Use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference to self
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is created using `weakref.proxy`, ensuring that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object correctly references the original object and prevents the `NoneType` error. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
