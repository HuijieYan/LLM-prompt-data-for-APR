Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the issue is related to the weak reference usage within the `_engine` function. The error message indicates that the `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the weak reference is not being passed correctly to the `_engine_type`.

To fix this bug, the approach would be to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being utilized properly within the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the `period` variable is now called as a function `period()` to ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized when passed to the `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue and the failing test.
