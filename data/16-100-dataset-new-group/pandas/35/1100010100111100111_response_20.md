### Analysis
The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected PeriodIndex, causing an AttributeError when trying to access the view method on the NoneType object. This is likely due to the weakref being dropped prematurely.

### Bug Cause
The _engine method is using weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to the self object, but it seems that the weak reference is being dropped before it's intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the issue, the weak reference to self needs to be maintained throughout the execution of the _engine method, ensuring that the PeriodEngine receives the intended PeriodIndex object.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we store the weak reference in the instance variable self._period_weakref to ensure that it's not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
