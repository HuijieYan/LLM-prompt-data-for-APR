Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to weak reference handling in the `_engine` function. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed. We can achieve this by modifying the function to use a `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` when passing the self reference to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref to maintain the weak reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` will be maintained until it is used in the `_engine_type`, resolving the issue of it being dropped prematurely.

With this fix, the failing test should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
