The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the weak reference `period` not being properly handled. This results in a 'NoneType' object when attempting to access the attribute `view`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly used and that the function doesn't return a 'NoneType' object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine creation failed")
    return engine
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we create a weak reference to `self` that allows the original object to be used even if it's been deleted. Additionally, we check if the engine is 'NoneType' and raise an error if it is, preventing the AttributeError from occurring.

With this fix, the failing test should pass without encountering the 'NoneType' object error.
