The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is not properly handling weak references, leading to a `NoneType` error when attempting to access the `view` attribute. This causes the failing test to throw an `AttributeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class to properly handle weak references and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` does not receive a `NoneType` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function for the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine")
    return engine
```

By checking that the `engine` object is not `None` after creating it with the `_engine_type`, any potential issue with the weak reference not being properly created or maintained will be caught, preventing the `NoneType` error from occurring.

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
