The cause of the bug: 
The error occurs in the `_engine` function due to the weak reference to the `self` object being passed as an argument to `_engine_type`. This causes the PeriodEngine to receive a None object instead of the intended PeriodIndex, resulting in the AttributeError.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained properly and not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```
In the corrected version, when invoking `_engine_type`, we add `()` at the end to immediately invoke the result of `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained until it's used. This will prevent the NoneType AttributeError issue.

The corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
