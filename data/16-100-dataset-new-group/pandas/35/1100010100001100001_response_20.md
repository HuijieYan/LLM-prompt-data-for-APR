## Analysis
The function `_engine` seems to be intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` as parameters. However, the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly.

## Bug
The bug seems to be in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, which creates a weak reference to `self` but is not being utilized in the subsequent call to `self._engine_type`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` when calling `self._engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Dereference the weak reference here
```
