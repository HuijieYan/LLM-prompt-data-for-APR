The buggy function `_engine` is designed to return a weakly referenced PeriodIndex to avoid a reference cycle and subsequently create an instance of the `_engine_type` with the weakly referenced PeriodIndex and the length of `self`. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to create a `PeriodIndex` and uses the `is_monotonic` attribute, but encounters an AttributeError when the engine value is called in the method.

The cause of the bug is that the period is not properly being weakly referenced and instead becomes a `NoneType` object, causing an AttributeError when the `is_monotonic` attribute is called on it. This is the cause of the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex needs to be properly maintained and utilized in the `_engine` function. The corrected version of the function should handle the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex correctly.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Corrected version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is used properly by calling it as a function before passing it to `_engine_type`, fixing the bug and meeting the expected input/output values. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
