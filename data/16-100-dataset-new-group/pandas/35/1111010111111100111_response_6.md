The buggy function `_engine` is causing an AttributeError when the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is executed. The failing test expects all level values to be monotonic, but it raises an AttributeError due to a weak reference being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, the weakref should be handled correctly to ensure that it does not get dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ...
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        # Get the weak reference object
        period_ref = period()
        # Check if the weak reference is valid before creating the engine
        if period_ref is not None:
            return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
In the corrected version, we first obtain the weak reference object using `period_ref = period()`, and then we check if it's valid. If the reference is valid, we proceed to create the engine using the weak reference `period_ref`.

This fix should ensure that the weak reference is handled properly and does not get dropped prematurely, resolving the AttributeError issue in the failing test.
