The bug in the current code is likely due to the weakref.ref(self) not being used correctly to create a weak reference to self. This is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the .view("i8") attribute of the weak reference.

To fix the bug, we should create a weak reference to the self object and then access the _engine_type using this weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using period() instead of just period, we're creating a weak reference to the actual self object and then calling _engine_type with this weak reference as intended.

This should fix the AttributeError and make the function work as expected in the failing test case.
