#### Fixing the buggy function

The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the use of `weakref.ref(self)`, which creates a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the correct usage of `weakref.ref` should be to call it with the object that needs to be referenced and then use the resulting weak reference object to access the original object.

As per the buggy function, it should return the `_engine_type` instance with a weak reference to `self`. The correct approach to fix this bug is to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then pass that weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor.

#### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to self
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the `_engine` function will create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass that weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor, avoiding any potential reference cycles.
