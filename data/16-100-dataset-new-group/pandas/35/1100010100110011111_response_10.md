The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference of `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the issue is that when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped, the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of `self` is not getting dropped prematurely. We can do this by storing the weak reference as an instance attribute to prevent it from being garbage-collected before it's actually needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weakref of self as an instance attribute
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as `self._period_ref`, we prevent it from being discarded prematurely.

With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This addresses the issue reported in GitHub.
