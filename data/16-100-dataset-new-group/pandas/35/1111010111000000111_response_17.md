The buggy function `_engine` is causing a weak referencing issue, leading to a bug reported on GitHub. The `PeriodIndex` class has a method called `_engine` that creates and returns a weak reference to the `self` parameter. However, the weak reference is not being maintained properly due to which the `PeriodEngine` is receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior and a failing test.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to create a weak reference to `self` and maintain that weak reference properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference of self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained properly, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as expected.

This fix should address the reported bug and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
