The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and then use it to initialize an attribute. However, it appears that the weak reference is unnecessary and could be causing the issue.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` object and its level values, but it fails because of the buggy `_engine` function.

To fix the bug, we can remove the unnecessary weak reference and directly initialize the attribute using `self`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
