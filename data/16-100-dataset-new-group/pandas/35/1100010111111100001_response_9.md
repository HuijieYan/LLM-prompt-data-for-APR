The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing an issue when creating the engine for PeriodIndex, leading to an AttributeError in the failing test. 

The bug possibly originates from the weak reference `period` being improperly passed to `self._engine_type`. This may be causing the `NoneType` object error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly create the weak reference and pass it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weakref of self to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference and length of the PeriodIndex to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference of `self` is properly passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the potential issue of passing a `NoneType` object and fixing the bug.
