#### Expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
- period: weakref to self
- return value: self._engine_type(period, len(self))

### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the use of weakref.ref() to create a weak reference to self. However, the weak reference is not being used correctly in the return statement.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to use the weak reference properly and ensure that it is being correctly passed to the _engine_type constructor.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
