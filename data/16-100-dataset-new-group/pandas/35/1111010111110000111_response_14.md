The issue here is that the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class returns `None` instead of the `PeriodEngine` object. This causes an `AttributeError` in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

To fix this, the `_engine` function needs to return the `PeriodEngine` object instead of `None`. To achieve this, we can modify the `_engine` function to create the `PeriodEngine` object using the weak reference to `self` and return it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```

By adding the `if self._engine_type else None` condition, we ensure that the function returns `None` if `self._engine_type` is not present, which prevents the AttributeError from occurring.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
