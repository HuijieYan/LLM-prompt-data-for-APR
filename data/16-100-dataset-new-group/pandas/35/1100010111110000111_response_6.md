The bug in the `_engine` function appears to be related to the weak reference implementation, which leads to a `NoneType` error when accessing the PeriodEngine. This causes the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to raise an error when checking for monotonically increasing values.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and used within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we create a weak reference proxy to `self` which allows the PeriodEngine to access the actual object when needed. This update should resolve the `NoneType` error and allow the failing test to pass.

By making this change, we can address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that `all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` returns `True` as expected.
