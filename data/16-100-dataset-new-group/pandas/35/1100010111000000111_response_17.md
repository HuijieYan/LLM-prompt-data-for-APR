The cause of the bug:
The _engine function uses weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to the self object, but it returns self._engine_type(period, len(self)) instead of self._engine_type(period(), len(self)). As a result, the weak reference to the self object may be dropped before intended.

To fix the bug:
The _engine function should return self._engine_type(period(), len(self)) to ensure that the weak reference to the self object is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this fix, the function should return the correct output, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
