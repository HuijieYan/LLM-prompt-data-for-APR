#### Analysis
The function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. This is used to avoid reference cycles.

#### Bug
The bug in the function is that it is not using the weak reference when calling `_engine_type`, which defeats the purpose of creating the weak reference in the first place.

#### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to use the weak reference when calling `_engine_type`.

#### Corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
