To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class to avoid dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before it's intended.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

This change ensures that the weak reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type` before it's dropped, resolving the bug and ensuring that the function works as expected.
