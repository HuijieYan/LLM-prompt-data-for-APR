Based on the provided buggy function and failing test, here's the analysis, identified error, bug causes, and a strategy for fixing the bug:

### Analysis:
The `_engine` function is a method of a class, as indicated by the `self` parameter. This method is expected to return the result of calling `_engine_type` with `period` and the length of `self` as arguments.

### Identified error:
The issue with the provided `_engine` function is that `weakref.ref(self)` is assigned to the variable `period`, but the `period` variable is not used in the subsequent call to `_engine_type`.

### Bug cause:
The bug is caused by passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type` instead of `self`. This can lead to incorrect behavior or errors when using `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should directly pass `self` (or a strong reference to `self`) to the `_engine_type` function instead of using a weak reference.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the `_engine` function correctly passes `self` directly to the `_engine_type` function, using a strong reference instead of a weak reference. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.

By making this change, the `_engine` function will use a strong reference to `self`, ensuring that the `_engine_type` function receives the correct object and operates as intended.
