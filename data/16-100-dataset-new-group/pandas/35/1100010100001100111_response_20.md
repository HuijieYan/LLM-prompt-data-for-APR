## Explanation:
The bug in the function `_engine` is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, which causes the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely and that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` instead of `None`.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
