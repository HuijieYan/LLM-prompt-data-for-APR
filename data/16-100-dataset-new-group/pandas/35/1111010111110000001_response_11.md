The bug in the `_engine` function occurs because the function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but the reference to `period` is a weak reference, thus leading to the `NoneType` object error.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference created using `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not being properly checked. When the `period` is accessed later as `period()` due to the weak reference, it could return `None` which leads to the AttributeError when trying to call `.view("i8")` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be re-implemented to properly handle the weak reference.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Check if period is a valid reference before using it
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self not available")
```

With this corrected version, if the weak reference becomes invalid, it will raise a `RuntimeError` to indicate the issue. This will prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.
