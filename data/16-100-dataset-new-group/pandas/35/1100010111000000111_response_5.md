## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

The bug occurred because the weak reference to `self` was not being converted to an actual reference before being passed to `_engine_type`. This resulted in `_engine_type` receiving a None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to the bug described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be converted to an actual reference by calling `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

The corrected version of the function above should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
