Based on the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the issue stems from the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in the function returning incorrect values, leading to the failing test case.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex needs to be maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the way the weak reference is handled within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of simply `period`, the weak reference is invoked and the reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the execution of the function.

This corrected version should address the premature dropping of the weak reference, allowing the `_engine` function to work as intended and pass the failing test case.
