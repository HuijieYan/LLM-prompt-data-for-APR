The potential error in the buggy function is that it is using weakref.ref() incorrectly. The weakref.ref() function should be used to create a weak reference to the object, but it is being assigned to the variable "period" instead of being used as an argument to self._engine_type. This may lead to unexpected behavior and could be the cause of the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should pass the weak reference of the object to self._engine_type instead of just assigning it to a variable. This can be done by directly passing the weakref.ref(self) as an argument to self._engine_type.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

This correction should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
