The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to the `self` object.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` instantiates a `PeriodIndex` and then creates a new `MultiIndex` called `idx2` by extracting the level values from `idx`. The failing assertion is related to the `is_monotonic` property of the index levels, which ultimately leads to an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

It appears that the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function is not being properly maintained, leading to a `NoneType` object being returned in some scenarios, causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly. One possible way to do this is to store a strong reference to `self` as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` object, which can then be used within the `_engine` function to create the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self in the _period attribute
    self._period = self
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._period)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By storing a strong reference to `self` in the `_period` attribute, we ensure that the weak reference created within the `_engine` function remains valid and prevents the `NoneType` object from being returned.

With this correction, the `PeriodIndex` class should now operate correctly and pass the failing test.
