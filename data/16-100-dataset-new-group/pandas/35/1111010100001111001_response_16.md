The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference to `self`. The weak reference is not being properly utilized and could be causing the function to fail. A weak reference should be used to avoid reference cycles and potential memory leaks when creating the `_engine_type` object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly use weak references. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In the corrected version, we have used `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and passed it to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the length of `self._values`.

This should fix the bug by properly utilizing weak references and avoiding potential reference cycles.
