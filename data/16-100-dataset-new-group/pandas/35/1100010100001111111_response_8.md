The bug in the provided function is likely causing issues with weak referencing, as indicated in the GitHub issue. The `weakref.ref(self)` is being passed as a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but it appears that the weak referencing is not being retained as intended.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to store the weak reference explicitly in a variable and pass that variable to `_engine_type` instead.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self in a variable
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
This change explicitly creates a weak reference to `self` and stores it in the `period_ref` variable, which is then passed to `_engine_type`. This should retain the weak referencing as intended and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
