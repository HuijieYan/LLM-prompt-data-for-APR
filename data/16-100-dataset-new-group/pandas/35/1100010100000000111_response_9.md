The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex, which leads to the error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped before it is intended.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are ensuring that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex `period` is not being dropped prematurely before it is intended to be used in the `_engine_type` function. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected output.
