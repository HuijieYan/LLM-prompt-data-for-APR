## Analysis:
The function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycles.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference may not be done correctly.
2. The `self._engine_type` method may not be used correctly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` and passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`.
2. Verify the correct usage of `self._engine_type` method.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
