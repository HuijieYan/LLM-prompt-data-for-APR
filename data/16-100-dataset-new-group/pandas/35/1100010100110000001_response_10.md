The error message indicates an 'AttributeError' in relation to the 'NoneType' object not having the attribute 'view'. This suggests that there is an issue with the 'vgetter' or '_engine_type' function, possibly returning 'None' instead of the expected engine object.

The bug is likely caused by the '_engine_type' function not returning the engine object as expected, resulting in a 'NoneType' object being passed to the 'vgetter' function which causes the 'AttributeError'.

To fix this bug, we can modify the implementation of the `_engine` function to ensure that the '_engine_type' function correctly returns the engine object, rather than 'None'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type can't be None")
    return engine_type
```

By using the conditional check to ensure that the returned 'engine_type' is not 'None', we can prevent the 'NoneType' object AttributeError from occurring. This should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
