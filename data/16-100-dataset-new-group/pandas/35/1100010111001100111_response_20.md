The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly creating a weak reference to the PeriodIndex self and passing it to _engine_type, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _engine function to properly create a weak reference to self and pass it to _engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to self is properly created and passed to _engine_type, ensuring that the PeriodEngine receives the PeriodIndex as expected.

This fix should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and ensure that the failing test now returns True as expected.
