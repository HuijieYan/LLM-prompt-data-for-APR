The bug in the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class appears to be related to weakref usage. The `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, causing the failing test in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weak reference to `self` is passed to the `_engine_type`, resolving the bug related to weakref usage. This corrected version of the `_engine` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
