The buggy function `_engine` is failing to properly create a weak reference to `self` and is causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in the failing test and the raised error when checking for monotonicity.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` needs to be created and used properly so that it is not dropped prematurely before being passed to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly create and use a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is created using `weakref.proxy(self)` to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue and the failing test.
