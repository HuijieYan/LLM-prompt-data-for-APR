The bug in the function `_engine` of the `PeriodIndex` class is likely causing weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly-ref'd `Period` reference in the `_engine` method is not correctly being passed. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should properly pass the weakly-ref'd `Period` reference to the `PeriodEngine` class. This can be achieved by correcting the reference to the `Period` object in the return statement of the `_engine` method.

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By adding parentheses to `period` in the return statement, we properly invoke the weak reference, ensuring that the correct `PeriodIndex` is passed to the `PeriodEngine` class.

With this correction, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test should pass. This should also address the issue reported in the GitHub post related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` losing weak refs.
