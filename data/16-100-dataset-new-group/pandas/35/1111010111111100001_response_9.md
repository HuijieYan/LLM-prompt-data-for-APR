The issue appears to be with the `_engine` property function in the `PeriodIndex` class which is using `weakref.ref(self)`. This is resulting in a reference cycle problem and causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to use a regular reference to `self`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By updating the function in this way, it should resolve the reference cycle problem and the AttributeError when accessing the `view` attribute.
