The _engine function returns an instance of self._engine_type, which should not be None. The bug occurs when the _engine_type is not being properly initialized before being returned by the _engine function, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access a non-existent attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the _engine_type is properly initialized before being returned by the _engine function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type must be initialized")
    return engine
```
