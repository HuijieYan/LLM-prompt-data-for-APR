The bug is likely caused by the _engine function returning an incorrect result based on the input parameters. The _engine function is supposed to return the engine type for the PeriodIndex, but it may be returning an incorrect value due to a reference cycle issue or weakref usage.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the weak reference to self is properly utilized to avoid a reference cycle, and that the _engine_type is correctly instantiated with the weak reference and the length of the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

This corrected version should address the potential reference cycle issue and ensure that the _engine_type is instantiated with the correct parameters, therefore passing the failing test.
