Given the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it should, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, the caching mechanism `_engine` should be modified to properly maintain a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` and avoid dropping it prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return result
```

By returning the result explicitly instead of using `@cache_readonly`, we can ensure that the weak reference is maintained and utilized correctly by the `_engine_type` constructor.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
