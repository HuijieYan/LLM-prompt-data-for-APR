Based on the buggy function and failing test code, the expected input values for the function are a `self` value of type PeriodIndex and no additional parameters. The function is expected to return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference of `self` and its length. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` with values "2019Q1" and "2019Q2".

The bug in the function is that `weakref.ref(self)` is being assigned to `period` but not being used to pass as a weak reference to `_engine_type`. Instead, the actual value of `self` is being passed, causing a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, we need to use `period` as a weak reference to `self` when calling `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now properly use a weak reference to `self` when calling `_engine_type`, preventing the reference cycle and fixing the bug.
