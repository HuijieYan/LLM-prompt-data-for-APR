The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before it should, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not being handled correctly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference to the `self` object and ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

In this corrected version, we are passing the weakly referenced `self` object to the `_engine_type` constructor and ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.
