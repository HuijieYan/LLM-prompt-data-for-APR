The error message indicates that there is an 'AttributeError' at line 499 of the file pandas/_libs/index.pyx, specifically, it is related to the fact that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. 

The bug is located in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class in the pandas library. The error message is triggered when trying to retrieve the view attribute from a NoneType object.

The cause of the bug is that the _engine_type function is not properly returning a valid object, resulting in a NoneType object being used later in the code.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the _engine_type function returns a valid object, and not a NoneType object. This can be done by modifying the _engine function to explicitly check for the existence of the returned object and handle the case when it is None.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is None:
        # handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        return None
    else:
        return engine_type
```

By adding a simple check for the validity of the returned object, we are preventing the later AttributeError from occurring. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
