The bug in the `_engine` function is likely related to the usage of `weakref.ref` and the `self._engine_type` method. The `weakref.ref` is used to create a weak reference to the `self` instance to avoid reference cycles, and then it is passed to the `_engine_type` method. However, there is a potential issue with the weak reference not being properly dereferenced before being used, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be dereferenced before being passed to the `_engine_type` method using the `weakref.proxy` method, which returns a weak proxy to the original `self` instance.

The corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period_proxy = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_proxy, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that the `self` instance is properly referenced and the bug related to weak references is fixed.
