Given the provided error message, it seems that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type. This is likely the cause of the `AttributeError` when the `is_monotonic_increasing` method tries to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this issue, the `_engine` function should return a valid object of the expected type, which should resolve the `AttributeError` in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a new instance of the PeriodEngine
    period_index = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period_index, len(self))  # Return a valid PeriodEngine instance
```

In the corrected version, we are creating a new instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, passing a weak reference to `self` and the length of the index. This should ensure that a valid object is returned from the `_engine` function, resolving the `NoneType` issue.
