## Strategy for fixing the bug
The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, resulting in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute. This suggests that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `NoneType` error.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function needs to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex`) remains valid throughout the execution of the `_engine` function. This can be achieved by modifying the weak reference creation and usage within the `_engine` function to ensure the `PeriodIndex` object is retained until it's no longer needed.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a local variable to hold a strong reference to self
    period_ref = self
    # Pass a weakref of period_ref to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(period_ref)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version of the function, we use a local variable `period_ref` to hold a strong reference to `self` before creating a weak reference to it. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object remains alive throughout the execution of the `_engine` function, resolving the premature dropping of the weak reference and the resulting `NoneType` error.
