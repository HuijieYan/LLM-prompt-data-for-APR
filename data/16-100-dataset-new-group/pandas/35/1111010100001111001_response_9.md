The bug in the given function seems to be related to the use of the `weakref` module and the initialization of the `_engine` attribute. The function is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not handled correctly, leading to a possible reference cycle.

To fix the bug, the use of `weakref` needs to be modified so that it correctly creates a weak reference to the `self` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to the `self` object is stored in `period_weakref` before being passed to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issues related to reference cycles and potential memory leaks.
