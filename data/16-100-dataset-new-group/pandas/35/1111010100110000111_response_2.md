The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference to the `self` object. The purpose of using a weak reference is to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems to be causing issues in the implementation.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a valid object, leading to an `AttributeError`. This suggests that the weak reference is not working as intended, causing the engine to receive the wrong type of object.

The GitHub issue confirms that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` object. The expected output is for the `is_monotonic` check to return `True` instead of raising an error.

To fix the bug, the weak reference mechanism should be revisited to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

# ...

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can ensure that the `PeriodEngine` will receive a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
