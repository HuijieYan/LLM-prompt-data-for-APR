The issue with the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be related to weak referencing and the creation of a weak reference to the `self` object. The error message suggests that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', which may be caused by the weak reference not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is properly created and maintained within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    try:
        period = period_weakref()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    except TypeError:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference error: period object has been garbage collected.")
```
In this corrected version, I've addressed the weak referencing issue by using a `try-except` block. If the weak reference to `self` returns a `NoneType`, it will raise a `RuntimeError` to indicate that the period object has been garbage collected.

This should resolve the weak referencing issue and ensure that the `_engine` function works as intended.
