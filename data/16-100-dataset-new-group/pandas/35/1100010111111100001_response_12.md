The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` to raise an `AttributeError`.

The bug is demonstrated by the error message, `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This indicates that the function is attempting to access the attribute `view` from a `NoneType` object, which leads to the `AttributeError`.

The cause of the bug lies in the implementation of the `_engine` function, where the weak reference of `self` is being used. It seems that the weak reference is not being properly constructed or used within the `_engine` function, leading to a `NoneType` object being returned.

To resolve the bug, the weak reference of `self` needs to be correctly established to avoid the reference cycle and return the appropriate `_engine_type` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By creating a separate weak reference `period_weakref` and passing it to the `_engine_type`, we can ensure that the proper weak reference is used, avoiding the `NoneType` object issue.

This corrected version should resolve the `AttributeError` and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
