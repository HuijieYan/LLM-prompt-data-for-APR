The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when calling the `is_monotonic` method on `idx2.levels`.

The cause of this bug is likely due to the `period` variable being a weak reference to `self` but the `_engine_type` function not handling weak references correctly.

To fix this bug, we can change the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, we don't need to worry about using weak references and the bug is resolved.
