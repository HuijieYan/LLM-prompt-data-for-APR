The given buggy function is a method called `_engine` with a decorator `@cache_readonly`. The function seems to be returning the result of `self._engine_type`, which is obtained by passing a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`.

The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` in the file `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` on line 499. This means that the value being returned is `None` instead of the expected object with a `view` attribute.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly to initialize the `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, we should use the weak reference properly to avoid a reference cycle.

Here's how we can fix the buggy function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we call `period()` to obtain the referenced object from the weak reference, which should prevent the `NoneType` issue.
