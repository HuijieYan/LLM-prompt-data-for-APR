The bug in the given code is causing an AttributeError when attempting to access the 'view' attribute on a 'NoneType' object. This indicates that the _engine_type is returning None instead of the expected engine object.

The potential error locations within the buggy code are the weakref usage and the return statement.

The cause of the bug is that the weakref.ref() function is not being used correctly, leading to the weak reference being invalidated or not properly creating a weak reference to the self object. This results in the _engine_type function receiving a None instead of the expected reference to the self object.

To fix the bug, the weakref usage needs to be corrected to properly create a weak reference to the self object and ensure it is still valid when passed to the _engine_type function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Fix the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
    return engine
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to self is now created using `period_ref = weakref.ref(self)` and then passed to the _engine_type function after invoking it as `period_ref()`. This ensures that a valid reference to self is passed to the _engine_type function.
