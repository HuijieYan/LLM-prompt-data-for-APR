The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class has a potential error in creating a weak reference to self and passing it to the `_engine_type`. The issue is related to weak reference management causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we can directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` without using weak reference. Since there is no need for a weak reference in this case, we can avoid the potential issue caused by weak reference management.

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type`, we avoid the weak reference management issue and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` instance.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
