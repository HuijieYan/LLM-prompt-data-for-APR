The bug in the function `_engine` is that it is using weakref incorrectly and not passing the period object correctly to `_engine_type`. This is resulting in a reference cycle and causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to use weakref correctly and pass the period object as a parameter to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weakref.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type correctly
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
