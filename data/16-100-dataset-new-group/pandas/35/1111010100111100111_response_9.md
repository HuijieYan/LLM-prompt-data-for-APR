Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_engine` function appears to be related to the weak reference being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The error message indicates an AttributeError for the 'NoneType' object, which means that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained and not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference `period` is maintained throughout the function, ensuring that it is not prematurely dropped.

By ensuring that the weak reference is maintained, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
