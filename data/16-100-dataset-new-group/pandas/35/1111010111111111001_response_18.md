The bug here seems to be related to the `_engine` function inside the `PeriodIndex` class. The `@cache_readonly` decorator is used to cache the function's output so that subsequent calls to the function with the same arguments do not recompute the output. However, in this case, it seems that the cache is not being set properly, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the cached value.

To fix this, we can manually set the cached value in the `_engine` function, ensuring that it is properly cached and retrieved on subsequent calls.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._cached_engine
```

By manually setting the cached value `_cached_engine` in the `_engine` function, we ensure that subsequent calls will retrieve the cached value rather than recomputing it.

This fix should resolve the `AttributeError` issue reported in the failing test.
