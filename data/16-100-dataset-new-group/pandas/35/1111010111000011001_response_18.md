### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which indicates that it's intended to be a read-only property. However, the function doesn't define any parameters and returns a new instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`. This indicates that the purpose is to create a new instance of the `_engine_type` class associated with the current `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Bug
The bug lies in the fact that the `_engine` function is not properly utilizing weak reference. It's creating a weak reference to `self` but not using it anywhere to avoid a reference cycle.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be properly utilized to avoid reference cycles, and the weak reference should be dereferenced, if necessary, to access the original object.

### Updated Buggy Function
```python
def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, dereference a weakref of self when necessary.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return period()._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By properly dereferencing the weak reference with `period()`, we ensure that any reference cycles are avoided and the original `PeriodIndex` instance is accessed correctly.

This updated function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
