The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError when the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is run. This is due to the `self._engine_type` being called with a weak reference to `self`, which is not properly handled.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled and utilized in creating the `_engine` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

This correction ensures that a weak reference to `self` is passed properly to the `_engine_type`, preventing the reference cycle issue and fixing the AttributeError.
