Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue is related to the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before it is intended. This leads to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex, causing the error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function to store the weak reference to `self` and use it when creating the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference `self._period_weakref` will be maintained throughout the function's execution, ensuring that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
