### Analysis
The issue is related to a weak reference loss in the `PeriodIndex` when using it with a `MultiIndex`. The `_engine` function is responsible for creating a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` and using it to instantiate a new instance of the `_engine_type`, but it's not done correctly, leading to a loss of weak reference.

### Potential error locations
The issue could be in the creation or usage of the weak reference `period` and passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` and the way it is passed to `_engine_type`. The weak reference is not being maintained properly, resulting in the loss of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before it is intended to be. This leads to `_engine` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained properly and passed correctly to `_engine_type` to prevent its premature loss.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
