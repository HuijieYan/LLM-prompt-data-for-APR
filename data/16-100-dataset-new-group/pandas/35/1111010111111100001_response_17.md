The bug is most likely due to the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object, which causes an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute. This suggests that the `_engine_type` function is not returning a valid object.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid object, and that the `_engine` function does not return `None`. 

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Engine type is None")
```

This version ensures that the `_engine` function does not return `None` and raises a `ValueError` if the `engine` object is `None`.
