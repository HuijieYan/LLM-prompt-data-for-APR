The bug is likely located in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message suggests that the `_engine` is returning a `NoneType` object, causing an attribute error when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the `_engine_type` not being able to construct the engine properly, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_engine_type` constructs and returns the engine properly, rather than returning `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:  # Check if engine is None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type failed to construct the engine")
    return engine
```

By adding a check for `None` and raising a `ValueError` if the `_engine_type` fails to construct the engine, we ensure that a `NoneType` object is not returned, fixing the bug.
