The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas.core.indexes.period import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))  # Assuming PeriodEngine is the appropriate class for _engine_type
```

In the corrected version, we are returning an instance of `PeriodEngine` using the weak reference to the `self` object. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
