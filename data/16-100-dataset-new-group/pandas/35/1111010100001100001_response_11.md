The buggy function _engine(self) is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it is not correctly implemented. It is intended to create a weak reference of the PeriodIndex object "self" and pass it to _engine_type along with the length of the PeriodIndex.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of weakref.ref(self) and the passing of only the weak reference to _engine_type.

To fix this bug, the function _engine(self) should be modified to correctly create a weak reference of the self object and pass both the weak reference and the length of the PeriodIndex to _engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type along with the length.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self._values))
```

With this fix, the _engine function will correctly create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object "self" and pass it along with the length to _engine_type, resolving the bug.
