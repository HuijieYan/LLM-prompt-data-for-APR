## Analysis
The issue seems to be related to a weak reference to `self` being passed to `_engine_type` in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the weak reference to `self` is not being handled correctly, resulting in a None value being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Weak reference creation: The weak reference to `self` might not be created correctly, causing it to be dropped prematurely.
2. `_engine_type` function: The way in which the weak reference is used in `_engine_type` might not handle None values correctly, leading to the AttributeError.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the weak reference to `self` being dropped before it should be, resulting in a None value being passed to `_engine_type`. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute on the NoneType object. The bug is causing the expected output to not be achieved, as the weak reference is not being handled properly, which is a likely cause of the failing test in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be handled correctly in the `_engine` function to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely. Additionally, the `_engine_type` function should handle None values from the weak reference gracefully to avoid the AttributeError. It may be necessary to revise the usage of weak references and ensure that they are maintained throughout the relevant parts of the code.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Using a lambda function with a weak reference to self to avoid premature dropping
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, a lambda function is used to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`. This lambda function ensures that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely. Additionally, the `_engine_type` function should be updated to handle the lambda-wrapped weak reference appropriately to avoid any issues with None values.
