The bug in the provided function `_engine` is causing an AttributeError when the `is_monotonic` property is accessed. This bug is likely due to the `self._engine_type` method returning a `NoneType`, which does not have the `view` attribute that is being accessed.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns an appropriate value that has the `view` attribute.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type_result is not None:
        return engine_type_result
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
```

This version of the function checks if the result of `_engine_type` is `None` and raises a `ValueError` if it is. This ensures that the `is_monotonic` property can be accessed without encountering an AttributeError.

With this fix, the tests should pass without encountering the AttributeError.
