### Analysis
The `_engine` function is a `cache_readonly` function that returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `self._engine_type` attribute. The expected output of the failing test is for the `idx2` object to have all levels that are monotonic.

### Bug Location
The bug seems to be in the `_engine` function where the `self._engine_type` is not returning the expected value.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test indicates an `AttributeError` with the message "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'", pointing to the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`. This suggests that the `_engine_type` is returning `None` instead of a valid engine object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._engine_type` returns a valid engine object and is not `None`. This can be checked by adding validation steps and ensuring that the engine type is properly initialized.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if self._engine_type is not None:
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case where the engine type is not valid
        raise ValueError("Engine type is None, unable to initialize engine.")
```
