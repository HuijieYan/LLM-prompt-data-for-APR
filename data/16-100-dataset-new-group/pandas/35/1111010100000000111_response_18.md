The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance. The problem is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, which results in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the function's execution.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we store the weak reference to the PeriodIndex in the `period_ref` variable and use it to create the PeriodEngine, ensuring that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, and the function should now work as intended.
