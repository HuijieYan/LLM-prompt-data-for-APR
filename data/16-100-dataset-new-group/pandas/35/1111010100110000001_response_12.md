The buggy function is the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class. The function tries to define a weak reference to the `self` object and then instantiate the `_engine_type` attribute using the weak reference and the length of the object.

The bug arises from the fact that `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to self, which needs to be dereferenced in order to interact with the PeriodIndex instance. However, the `_engine` method does not use the weak reference correctly. When the `_engine_type` instance is called with the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`, it doesn't properly handle the weak reference and this leads to the AttributeError encountered when trying to access a 'NoneType' object.

To fix this bug, the correct strategy is to correctly dereference the weak reference before using it to instantiate the `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by replacing `period` with `period()` which will return the referent object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period()  # Dereference the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
