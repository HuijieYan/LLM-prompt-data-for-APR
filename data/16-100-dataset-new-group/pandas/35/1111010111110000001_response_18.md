The buggy function is the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. The `PeriodIndex` class has a relationship with the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` via the use of a `PeriodIndex` object.

The `_engine` method appears to be attempting to create and return an `_engine_type` instance by passing a weak reference to itself to the `_engine_type` constructor.

The error message indicates that the returned engine is a `NoneType` and lacks the attribute `view`. This likely means that the `_engine_type` is not being generated correctly within the `_engine` method.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should be modified to ensure that the `_engine_type` is created and returned appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Check if _engine type already exists, if not, create and return it
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._cached_engine
```
