```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

### Explanation
The issue with the original function is that it tries to create a weak reference to the 'self' object, but instead, it should create a weak reference to the 'self' object's data to avoid any potential reference cycles.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the code to create a weak reference to the 'self' object's data. This can be achieved by accessing the '_data' attribute of the 'self' object and then creating a weak reference to it.

### The corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self._data to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._data)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
