The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then use it to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class. However, it seems that the weak reference is not properly being used, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The bug seems to be related to the weak reference not being properly created or used, resulting in a `NoneType` when trying to access the `view` attribute on the weak reference.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be properly created and used to create the instance of the `_engine_type` class.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    ... (other class documentation)
    """

    # the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the `weakref.ref` is replaced with `weakref.proxy` to properly create a weak reference to the `self` object and prevent the reference cycle. This should fix the issue with the weak reference and allow the correct creation of the instance of the `_engine_type` class.
