The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex, which leads to the error described in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is retained for as long as needed by the PeriodEngine. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function to store the weakly referenced self in a class attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# assume the necessary imports are already included

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # other class methods and attributes here

    _period_ref = None  # class attribute to store weakref of self

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self in the class attribute _period_ref.
        if self._period_ref is None:
            self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        period = self._period_ref()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we store the weakly referenced self in the class attribute `_period_ref` to ensure it remains available for the PeriodEngine for as long as needed.

By making this change, we address the bug that caused the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped prematurely, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
