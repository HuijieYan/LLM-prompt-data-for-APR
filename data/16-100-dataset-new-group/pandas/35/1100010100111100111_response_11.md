The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This is occurring because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained for the duration of the operation in the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

By maintaining the weak reference to `self` and assigning the result to `engine`, we ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is retained for the duration of the operation.

This should resolve the issue and the failing test case, ensuring that the expected output of `True` is returned.
