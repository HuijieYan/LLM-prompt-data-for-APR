The bug seems to be related to the function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of a NoneType object.

The code in the `_engine` function uses a weak reference to the `self` object to create an instance of `_engine_type`. However, it seems that the weak reference might not be working as intended, leading to a NoneType object being returned.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to create a strong reference to the `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the `self` object is not garbage collected, resolving the weak reference issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By using a strong reference to `self`, we ensure that the `self` object will not be garbage collected before the `_engine_type` instance is created.

This correction should resolve the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of the NoneType object and fix the failing tests.
