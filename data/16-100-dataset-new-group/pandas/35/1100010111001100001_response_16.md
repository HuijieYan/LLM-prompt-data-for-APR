The issue with the buggy function is that it is using weakref incorrectly, which is causing the failing test to occur. The weakref.ref function creates a weak reference to the object passed to it, and it should be used to avoid creating a reference cycle, not as an argument to _engine_type. 

To fix the bug, we need to remove the weakref usage and directly pass self to _engine_type.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly return the engine type based on the input PeriodIndex and the failing test should pass.
