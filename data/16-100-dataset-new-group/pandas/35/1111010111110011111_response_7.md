The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `period` is weakly referenced. However, the weakly referenced `period` may be dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to store the weakly referenced `self` in a variable before using it. This will ensure that `period` maintains a reference to `self` for the duration of its usage.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self in a variable before passing it to _engine_type.
    ref_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(ref_self, len(self))
```
By storing `ref_self` as a weak reference to `self` before using it in the `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid throughout the usage.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test case.
