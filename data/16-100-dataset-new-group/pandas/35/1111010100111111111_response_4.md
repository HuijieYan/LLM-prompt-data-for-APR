The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error message. The function seems to be intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class that takes a weak reference to the `self` period and its length. However, due to the bug, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `NoneType` error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` period is maintained. We can modify the function to use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to keep the weak reference alive.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` will be kept alive, and the `_engine` function should return an instance of `_engine_type` without causing the `NoneType` error. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
