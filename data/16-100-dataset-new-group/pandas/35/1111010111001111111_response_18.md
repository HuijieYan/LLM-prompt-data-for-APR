The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` method to properly handle the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

This change ensures that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, preventing it from becoming a None. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
