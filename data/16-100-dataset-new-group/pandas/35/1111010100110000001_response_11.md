The buggy function is the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. The issue is that the `self._engine_type` is being called with the weak reference object `period` and `len(self)`. However, it seems that the `_engine_type` method doesn't return a valid engine instance, resulting in the error message.

The cause of the error is that the `_engine_type` method does not return a valid engine instance, resulting in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should explicitly check if the return value of `_engine_type` is not `None` and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    # Check if the engine is not None
    return engine if engine is not None else super()._engine
```

With this fix, the method first attempts to get the engine from `_engine_type`, and if it's not `None`, it is returned. If it's `None`, it falls back to the default behavior by returning the engine provided by the super class.
