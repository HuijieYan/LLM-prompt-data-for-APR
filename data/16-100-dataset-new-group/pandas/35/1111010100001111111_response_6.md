The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing the issue reported on GitHub where copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weakrefs.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to correctly initialize the `PeriodEngine` with the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is being properly passed to the `_engine_type` initialization.

With this fix, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved and the function should return the correct values for the given input parameters.
