The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorated function that takes the `self` and calls the `_engine_type` with two arguments `period` and `len(self)`. This function is used when checking the monotonicity of the index values.

Looking at the error message, it's clear that the problem arises when trying to access the 'view' attribute of a 'NoneType' object. This indicates that the `_engine` method is returning `None`, and when the attribute `view` is accessed on a `None` object, it raises an `AttributeError`.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that `_engine` returns a valid engine instance of type `PeriodEngine`. It may be that the `_engine_type` method is not returning the correct type of object.

The corrected version of the function should instantiate and return an instance of `PeriodEngine` with the correct parameters.

```python
import weakref

class PeriodEngine:
    def __init__(self, period, length):
        self.period = period
        self.length = length

# buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

By instantiating a `PeriodEngine` with the correct parameters and returning it from the `_engine` function, the bug should be fixed. Make sure the new `PeriodEngine` class has the necessary methods and attributes to handle the monotonicity checking in the index.
