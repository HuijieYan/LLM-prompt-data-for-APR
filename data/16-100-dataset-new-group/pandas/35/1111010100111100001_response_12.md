The bug in the provided function is causing an AttributeError to be raised when the method `is_monotonic` is called on the `PeriodEngine` object. The error message indicates that the `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the `vgetter` method of the `PeriodEngine` is returning `None` instead of a valid object.

The bug seems to be related to the `_engine_type` method not properly initializing the `PeriodEngine` object to which the `is_monotonic` method is being called.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method initializes the `PeriodEngine` object correctly, and that it returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object rather than `None`.

One way to fix this bug is to modify the `_engine` method to handle the initialization of the `PeriodEngine` object properly. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_engine = self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
    if period_engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type did not return a valid PeriodEngine object")
    return period_engine
```

By adding a check to ensure that the `period_engine` object is not `None`, we can avoid the AttributeError that was previously being raised.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
