The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an error in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method when trying to access the `self._engine` attribute, leading to an AttributeError stating that 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function is returning a valid object and not None. Additionally, we need to pass the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` correctly in order to avoid a reference cycle.

Based on the error message and the buggy function, it seems that there is an issue with the weak reference creation and passing it to `_engine_type`. The fix should involve creating a weak reference appropriately and then using it to instantiate the `_engine_type` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By creating a `period_weakref` using `weakref.ref(self)` and then passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that a weak reference to the `self` object is properly constructed and used, addressing the issue of a NoneType object being returned by `_engine`.
