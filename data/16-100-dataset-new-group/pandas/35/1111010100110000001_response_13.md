The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorator. It initializes an object adopting the `_engine_type` method to call it with a `weakref` of the PeriodIndex instance's length to return the engine.

On the basis of the error message from the failing test, the issue could be that the `_engine_type` is likely not returning an object but instead a `NoneType`.

A potential strategy for resolving this bug could be to delve into the `_engine_type` method and ensure that it returns the proper object instead of `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine creation failed: _engine_type returned None")
    
    return engine
``` 

The corrected version of the `_engine` function checks if the `_engine_type` method returns `None` and raises a ValueError if it does. This allows for clearer identification of the source of the issue, ensuring that the engine is not of type `NoneType`.
