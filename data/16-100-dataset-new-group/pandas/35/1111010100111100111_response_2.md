The issue seems to be related to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before it's intended to, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely. We can use a weakref to ensure that a reference cycle is avoided.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

In this corrected version, we add a check to ensure that `period()` is not None before calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This check ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is still available when `_engine` is called.

By making this change, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` will not be dropped prematurely, and the bug causing the AttributeError should be resolved. This should address the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
