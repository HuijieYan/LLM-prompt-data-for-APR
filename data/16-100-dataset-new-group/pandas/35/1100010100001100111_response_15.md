Based on the GitHub issue and the provided runtime values, it is clear that the issue is related to weakrefs being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is causing the error to be raised when checking for monotonicity.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weakref to self is maintained until the engine type is created. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function to store the weakref of self to a variable and then pass that variable to the engine type.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```
