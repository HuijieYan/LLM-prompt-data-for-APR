Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue is related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `NoneType` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and passed to `_engine_type` without being dropped prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `period()` is used instead of `period` to ensure that the weak reference is properly resolved before being passed to `_engine_type`.

This change should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test passes successfully.
