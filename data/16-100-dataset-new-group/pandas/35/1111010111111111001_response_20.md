The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the assignment of `weakref.ref(self)` to `period` instead of directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`. This likely results in a `NoneType` object being returned, causing the AttributeError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without using `weakref`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This modification will ensure that the correct `PeriodIndex` object is passed to `_engine_type`, fixing the AttributeError issue observed in the failing test.
