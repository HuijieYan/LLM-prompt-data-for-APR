The bug in the given function is that the weak reference to `self` is not being properly passed to `_engine_type`, which may lead to a reference cycle and memory leak.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to properly pass the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By correctly passing the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, the bug should be fixed and potential reference cycles and memory leaks should be avoided.
