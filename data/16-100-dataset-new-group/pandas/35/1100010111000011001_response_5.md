### Analyzing the Buggy Function

1. The buggy function is a `@cache_readonly` decorator, which means it should cache the value of the function after the first execution and return the cached value on subsequent calls.
2. The function is creating a weak reference to `self`, and then using it to initialize the `_engine_type`.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
The potential error in the code is with the caching mechanism. It seems that the cache is not working as expected, causing the function to recalculate the value every time it is called.

### Explaining the Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the fact that the caching mechanism is not properly storing the value of the `_engine` function, which results in the function being recalculated every time it is called. This behavior is highlighted by the failing test case, where the monotonic property of the `idx2.levels` is not being preserved.

### Suggesting a Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the caching mechanism works correctly and actually stores the value of the `_engine` function after the first execution.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._cached_engine
```
