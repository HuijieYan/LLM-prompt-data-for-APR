The bug in the given function is that the weak reference (weakref.ref) is being passed as an argument to the _engine_type function, instead of the actual object. This will result in the _engine_type function not receiving the correct reference to the object, leading to potential errors.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the actual object (self) to the _engine_type function instead of the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing the actual object (self) to the _engine_type function, we ensure that the correct reference to the object is received, fixing the bug.
