## Bug Analysis
The `_engine` function is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests it should be caching the result of the function. The function is creating a weak reference to the `self` object and then returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being accessed, suggesting that the weak reference is not working correctly. This is likely causing the `PeriodEngine` object to be `None` when it is accessed.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The weak reference to the `self` object is not working correctly, resulting in a `NoneType` being accessed. It's likely that the weak reference is being garbage collected too soon, causing the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call to reference `None`. To fix this, we can create a strong reference to `self` inside the `_engine` function and use that strong reference to create the `PeriodEngine` object.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
from pandas.core.indexes.period import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self
    strong_ref_to_self = self
    # Pass the strong reference to _engine_type
    period = strong_ref_to_self
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(strong_ref_to_self))
```
