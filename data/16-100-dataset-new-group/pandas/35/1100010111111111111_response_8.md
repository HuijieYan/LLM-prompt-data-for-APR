The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the weak reference being used incorrectly which results in the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected PeriodIndex object. This causes the AttributeError when the test attempts to check if the index is monotonic.

To fix the bug, the weak reference must be used correctly to avoid the reference cycle and ensure that the engine receives the intended PeriodIndex object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref to the PeriodEngine.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By using the weakref.ref() function correctly, we ensure that the PeriodIndex object is weakly referenced to avoid a reference cycle, resolving the bug and allowing the engine to receive the PeriodIndex object as intended. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
