## Fixing the bug
Looking at the error message and the provided runtime values and types of the variables, it seems that the issue is with the weak reference being dropped before it should, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is causing the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' when trying to access the view method.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be managed properly to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely and that the PeriodIndex is available when needed.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))

    return engine
```

By explicitly storing the weak reference to `self` in a variable `period_weakref` and passing that to `_engine_type` instead of just `weakref.ref(self)`, we can ensure that the weak reference is not lost prematurely, and the `PeriodIndex` is available when needed. This should resolve the AttributeError issue and ensure that the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
