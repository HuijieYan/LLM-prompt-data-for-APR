The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorator, which is meant to cache the return value of the function. The error message indicates an AttributeError involving a 'NoneType' object. This suggests that the `_engine_type` is returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing the subsequent view call to fail.

A potential cause of this bug could be the weakref usage in the `_engine` function. When using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, the weak reference must be accessed using the `period()` method to retrieve the original object. It's possible that the `_engine_type` method is not handling the weak reference correctly and is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is being correctly handled and that the `_engine_type` method is returning the expected engine object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type_result is not None:  # Check if engine_type_result is not None
        return engine_type_result  # Return engine_type_result if not None
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")  # Raise an error if engine_type_result is None
```

By adding a check for `None` and raising an error if the `_engine_type` returns `None`, we can ensure that the function does not return a `NoneType` object. This should address the AttributeError issue reported in the failing test.
