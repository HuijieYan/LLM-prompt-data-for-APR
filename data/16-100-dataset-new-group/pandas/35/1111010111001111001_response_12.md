The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function is that it's returning an instance of `_engine_type` without properly passing the weak reference of `self` to it. This can lead to a reference cycle issue.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to properly pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. We can use the `weakref` module to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self._values)
```

By modifying the function to properly pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` and passing the length of `self`, the corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
