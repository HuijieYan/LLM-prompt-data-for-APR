Based on the error message and the provided runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug is related to the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being lost before it is intended to. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a NoneType object instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and used to create the `Period` object. Additionally, we should ensure that the `len(self)` parameter is correctly calculated and provided to the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self._values))
```

In this corrected version, we create the `Period` object using `period()` and also use `len(self._values)` to ensure we are passing the correct length to the `PeriodEngine`.

With this fix, the failing test should pass and the function should work as expected, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
