The cause of the bug is that the `_engine_type` method is returning a `NoneType` object, causing the subsequent attribute access to fail.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to check if the result from `_engine_type` is `None`, and if so, handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        return None  # Or raise an exception, depending on the desired behavior
    return engine
```
