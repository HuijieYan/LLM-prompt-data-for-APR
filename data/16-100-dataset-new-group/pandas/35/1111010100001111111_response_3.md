The issue with the buggy function is that the `weakref.ref` is not being used correctly, resulting in the weakly referenced PeriodIndex getting dropped prematurely.

To fix this, we can modify the `_engine` function to correctly use `weakref.ref` to create a weakly referenced object, ensuring that the PeriodEngine does not receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

By adding `self._data` with the `len()` function, we ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is maintained until the expected time.

This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensures that the problem should no longer occur.
