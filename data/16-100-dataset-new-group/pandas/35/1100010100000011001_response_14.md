#### Analysis:
The function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, so it is likely caching the result after the first call. The use of `weakref` suggests that the function is trying to avoid creating a reference cycle by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.

#### Identification of Potential Error:
The use of `weakref` and the call to `self._engine_type` seems to be the potential cause of the bug. There might be a problem with how the weak reference is used or how it's passed to `_engine_type`.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by the incorrect use of `weakref.ref(self)` and passing it to `self._engine_type`. This could be leading to an incorrect state being returned from `_engine_type`.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The use of weak references and the call to `_engine_type` needs to be carefully handled. It may be necessary to revisit the purpose of using `weakref` and how it's supposed to interact with `_engine_type`.

#### Corrected Version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
In the corrected version, `period` is being called as a function `period()` before being passed to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly used and the actual object is passed to `_engine_type`.
