## Corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

## Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to create a weak reference to the 'self' object and pass it to '_engine_type' function. However, the 'self' object is not being called as a function when creating the weak reference, potentially leading to issues with the weak reference.

## Potential error locations
The potential error is in the weak reference creation where 'period' is assigned the weak reference to 'self' without being called as a function.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by not properly creating the weak reference to 'self' by calling it as a function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference to 'self' should be called as a function when creating it.

## Corrected version
The corrected version of the function addresses the bug by calling 'period' as a function when creating the weak reference.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
