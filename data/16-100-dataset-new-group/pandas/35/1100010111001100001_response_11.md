The buggy function attempts to use a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle when creating the `_engine`. However, it seems that the function is not properly accessing the `self` object to create the weak reference, which could be causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly create a weak reference to the `self` object and then use it to create the engine.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By changing `period` to `period()`, we are now creating a weak reference to the `self` object and using it to create the engine. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
