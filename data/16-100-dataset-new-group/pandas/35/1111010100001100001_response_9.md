The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` with the `self` and the length of `self` as arguments.

The potential error in the function is that it is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. This could lead to the weak reference being garbage collected and causing unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` may be getting garbage collected before being used in `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior when using the weak reference.

To fix the bug, we can pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` without using a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type` without using a weak reference, we ensure that the reference to `self` is not garbage collected prematurely, fixing the bug in the function.
