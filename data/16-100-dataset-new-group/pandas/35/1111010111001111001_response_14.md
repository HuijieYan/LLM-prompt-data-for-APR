The bug is likely caused by the `_engine` function not properly handling the `self` reference. The `weakref.ref` is creating a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly when instantiating `_engine_type`. This is likely causing issues with the `Period` and `PeriodIndex` objects.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should properly use the weak reference to `self` when instantiating `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

The corrected version uses `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self`, which can be safely passed to `_engine_type` without causing a reference cycle. This should fix the issue and satisfy the expected input/output values.
