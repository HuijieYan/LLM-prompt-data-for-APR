## Analysis of the buggy function:
The function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that it is meant to be a cached and read-only property. It creates a weak reference to `self` and then uses this weak reference to initialize a new `_engine_type` object.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Weak reference creation may not be working as intended.
2. Incorrect usage of `self._engine_type`.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The weak reference creation may not be preserving the reference to `self` as intended, leading to unexpected behavior when initializing the `_engine_type` object. Additionally, the usage of `self._engine_type` may be incorrect.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is created and used correctly.
2. Verify that the usage of `self._engine_type` is appropriate and matches the intended purpose.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Use the weak reference to initialize the _engine_type object
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is used to initialize the `_engine_type` object by calling it as a function `period()`. This ensures that the weak reference is correctly dereferenced.
