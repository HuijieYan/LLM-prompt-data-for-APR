The root cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is leading to the unexpected behavior and causing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely and is still available when the `_engine_type` method is called.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In the corrected version, we are passing a weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` method, ensuring that the PeriodIndex is still available when needed, and preventing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
