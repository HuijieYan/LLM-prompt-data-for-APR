The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak referencing of the `self` object. The function creates a weak reference to `self` and then attempts to use it to create a new instance of the `_engine_type` class. However, it appears that the weak reference to `self` is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `_engine` function returning None instead of the expected `_engine_type` instance.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the execution of the `_engine` function. One potential strategy for fixing this issue is to store the weak reference to `self` as an attribute of the returned `_engine_type` instance. This way, the weak reference will continue to exist as long as the `_engine_type` instance is referenced.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine_instance._period_ref = period  # Store the weak reference as an attribute of the engine instance
    return engine_instance
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` as an attribute of the returned `_engine_type` instance, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid as long as the engine instance is referenced. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `_engine` function returns the expected `_engine_type` instance instead of None.
