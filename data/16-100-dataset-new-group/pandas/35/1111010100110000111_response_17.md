The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only property of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is supposed to return the engine type associated with the index, but it doesn't properly handle weak reference, leading to an AttributeError when the weak reference is dropped prematurely.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it should be, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` type, leading to the AttributeError.

The fix for the bug involves properly managing the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance so that it is not prematurely dropped. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in an instance variable and using the weak reference to create the engine.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other class code)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use a weak reference to prevent premature dropping
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

With this change, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is explicitly stored in `self._period_ref` and used to create the engine, ensuring that the weak reference is not prematurely dropped.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and resolve the AttributeError when accessing `is_monotonic` on `idx2.levels`.
