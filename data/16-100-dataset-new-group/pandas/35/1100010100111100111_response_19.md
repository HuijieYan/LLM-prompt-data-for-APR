The bug occurs because when creating a weak reference to `self`, it is not being maintained, causing it to be dropped prematurely. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference to `self` throughout its lifetime. We can use a class-level weakref to achieve this.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference of self at the class level
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By maintaining the weak reference at the class level and checking if it has already been created, we ensure that it persists as long as the class exists, preventing the premature dropping of the weak reference and resolving the AttributeError issue.

With this fix, the failing test should pass, and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
