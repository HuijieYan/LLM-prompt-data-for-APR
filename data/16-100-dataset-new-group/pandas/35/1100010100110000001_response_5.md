The potential error location within the given buggy function is the weakref usage.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference being used in the _engine function is not properly handling the reference to the object, leading to a 'NoneType' object error.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the object is properly handled so that it does not become a 'NoneType' object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly handle the weak reference to the object
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By changing `period` to `period()` when calling the weak reference, we are now passing the actual object rather than the weak reference, which should fix the issue.
