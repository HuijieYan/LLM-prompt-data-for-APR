The bug is likely in the implementation of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that an attribute `view` is called on a `NoneType` object, suggesting that the `_engine` function is not returning a proper object.

The `_engine` function uses a `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is then passed to the `_engine_type` to create the engine. However, it appears that the weak reference is not being properly resolved, causing the `_engine` function to return `None`.

To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref` object creation needs to be modified to ensure that the weak reference is properly resolved and that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)  # Use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
