Based on the error message and the failing test, it seems that the `_engine_type` method is not able to handle a weak reference properly. This is evident from the error message that says "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'", indicating that the weak reference might not be working as expected when the engine is called.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` method to return a strong reference to `self` instead of a weak reference. This can be achieved by directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` method, which should resolve the weak reference cycle issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By returning the strong reference to `self`, we ensure that the `self` object is still available when the `_engine_type` method is called, preventing any issues related to weak references.

This fix should resolve the error and make the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass, as the `_engine` method will now correctly return a usable engine object.
