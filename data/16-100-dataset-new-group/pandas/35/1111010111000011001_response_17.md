- self: PeriodIndex object

#### The expected output value and type for the failing test
The buggy function does not return a value, but it should not throw an error during the execution of the failing test.

### Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect initialization and handling of the weak reference object `period` in the `_engine` function.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference object `period` should be correctly initialized and used within the `_engine` function to avoid the reference cycle.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```
