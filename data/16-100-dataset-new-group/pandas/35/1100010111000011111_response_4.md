The bug in the provided function seems to be related to weak referencing and the potential loss of the weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance.

Potential error locations:
1. The weakref.ref(self) might not be correctly creating a weak reference to self.
2. If self._engine_type is dependent on the weak reference to the PeriodIndex, it might be receiving None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the expected PeriodIndex, leading to unexpected behavior when accessing the levels of the MultiIndex.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to self is correctly created using weakref.ref().
2. Verify that the self._engine_type properly handles weak references and does not assume the availability of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With the corrected function, the issue described on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test should pass with the expected output.
