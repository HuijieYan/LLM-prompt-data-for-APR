Given the analysis, it appears that the bug is related to the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType object instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access its 'view' attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed. One approach to do this is by using a context manager to create and maintain the weak reference within the _engine function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    with weakref.ref(self) as period:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained within the context manager, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
