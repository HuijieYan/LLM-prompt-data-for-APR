The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the weakref usage. The weak reference is being created with the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, but it is not being properly handled when passed to `self._engine_type`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly accessed and handled within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By creating `period_ref` as a reference to `self`, and then passing it to `self._engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly handled and accessed. This should fix the bug and make the test function pass.
