The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex`. However, the bug is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before it is intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should create and use a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` without prematurely dropping it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Use the weak reference to create the PeriodEngine
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is properly created and used to avoid the premature dropping of the object, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
