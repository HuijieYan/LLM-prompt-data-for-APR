The buggy function `_engine` is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, indicating that it is supposed to be a read-only cached property. The issue seems to be related to the caching mechanism not functioning correctly.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` seems to be creating a MultiIndex from Periods and attempting to check if the levels are monotonic. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError due to a 'NoneType' object not having the attribute 'view', suggesting that the `_engine` function is returning `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine instance for the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine_cache'):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._engine_cache = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_cache
```
In this corrected version, we maintain a cache for the engine instance, ensuring that it is only created once and reused on subsequent calls.

This should resolve the AttributeError issue and allow the failing test to pass.
