The bug in the provided function `_engine` is likely causing the error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` in the failing test. This error is occurring because the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object when it should be returning the `_engine_type` object.

To fix this bug:
1. The `weakref.ref(self)` should be called to create a weak reference to the `self` object. Then, the reference to `self` should be accessed using `period()` method to obtain the actual object.
2. Ensure that the `_engine_type` method is being called correctly with the weak reference and the length of `self` as arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With the above correction, the `_engine` method should now return the correct object and resolve the `AttributeError` issue mentioned in the failing test.
