The buggy function '_engine' is using the 'cache_readonly' decorator, which suggests that it is intended to cache the result of the function. However, the decorator is not being used correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the '_engine' function is not caching the result of the function call properly, leading to unexpected behavior in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should remove the '@cache_readonly' decorator and replace it with a manual caching mechanism to store and retrieve the result of the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine_result'):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_result
```
In the corrected version, we manually check if the cached result exists and, if not, we calculate it and store it in the '_engine_result' attribute of the object. Subsequent calls to the '_engine' function will return the cached result instead of recalculating it.
