The buggy function is the `_engine` method in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The error message from the failing test is related to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which is a result of the `_engine` method returning a `NoneType` object when it should be returning a valid engine type.

The potential error within the buggy function is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly handling the weak reference `period`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` method returns a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError` when the failing test tries to access an attribute of the returned object.

To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be properly handled within the `_engine` method, ensuring that it returns a valid engine type instead of a `NoneType` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```
By explicitly assigning the `_engine_type` to a variable and returning it as `engine`, the weak reference `period` is correctly handled within the function, ensuring that a valid engine type is returned.

This correction should resolve the `AttributeError` encountered in the failing test.
