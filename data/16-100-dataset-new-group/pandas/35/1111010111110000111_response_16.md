The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the failing test. The `_engine` function is using the `cache_readonly` decorator, indicating that it's meant to cache the result of the function and return the cached result on subsequent calls. However, in the bug, it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without caching the result.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `PeriodIndex` from MultiIndex, and then check the monotonicity of the levels. However, this fails due to weak reference issues because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to an `AttributeError`.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `_engine` function uses the `@cache_readonly` decorator correctly to cache the result of the function.
2. Use the weak reference of `self` effectively to avoid the reference cycle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
    return result
```

By using the weak reference of `self` and ensuring that the result of the function is cached, the corrected version of the function should resolve the weak reference issues and pass the failing test.
