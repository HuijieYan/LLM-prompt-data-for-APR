The bug in the `_engine` function appears to be related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object. The function returns a weak reference to `self`, but it seems that the weak reference is dropped before expected, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The error message mentions that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the weak reference is not being properly handled and is resulting in a `None` object being used in place of the expected `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` should be properly maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as a property of the object or using appropriate mechanisms to ensure the reference is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self as a property of the object.
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as a property of the object, we ensure that it is not dropped prematurely and remains available for use within the `_engine` function.

This corrected version should resolve the weak reference issue and pass the failing test case.
