The buggy function `_engine` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is likely causing weakrefs to be dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` attempts to check if all levels of the MultiIndex `idx2` are monotonic, but it fails with an `AttributeError` due to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` object instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is kept alive until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref(), len(self))
```

By using the weakly referenced `period_weakref` instead of `period`, we ensure that the PeriodIndex is not prematurely dropped, addressing the bug.

This fix should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
