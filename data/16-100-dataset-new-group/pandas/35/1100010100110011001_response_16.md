This buggy function seems to be related to the error message received. The function `_engine` is expected to return an instance of `self._engine_type` but it seems to be returning `None` instead, which leads to the 'NoneType' object error.

The cause of the bug might be that the weak reference to `self` is not being used correctly and it's returning `None` instead of the actual reference to `self`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is being used and accessed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected function, we use `period()` to access the weak reference and retrieve the actual reference to `self`. This should resolve the issue and the function should now return the correct instance of `self._engine_type`.
