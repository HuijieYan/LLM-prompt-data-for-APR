The bug in the function `_engine` is causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex due to the dropping of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex. This is resulting in an AttributeError when the `is_monotonic` attribute is accessed.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely and that it is properly passed to the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self is not None else None
```
In the corrected version, we are checking if `self` is not None before passing it to `_engine_type` to avoid the AttributeError. This will prevent the weakly referenced PeriodIndex from being dropped prematurely, and it should resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
