### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly which is causing the bug. The test case is failing because the `is_monotonic` attribute is not being set correctly due to the bug in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This results in the `_engine_type` receiving an incorrect reference to `self` when it is called, leading to incorrect behavior in the returned `self._engine_type` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The correct way to create a weak reference to an object is by using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`. By doing so, the `_engine_type` will receive the correct `self` reference and behave as expected.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
