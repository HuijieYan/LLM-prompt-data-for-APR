The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorator on the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the attribute `view` is being accessed on a `NoneType` object, which suggests that the `_engine` property is returning `None` instead of an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, which is expected.

It seems that the function `_engine()` is not returning the expected type of object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the function should return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class instead of `None`, fixing the bug and passing the failing test.
