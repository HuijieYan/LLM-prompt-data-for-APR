### Fixing the bug
The error message suggests that the `_engine` attribute, which is supposed to reference an engine type, is returning a `NoneType` instead of the expected engine type. This is resulting in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The issue is likely with the implementation of the `_engine` function, where it should be returning a valid engine type instead of `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct engine type.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type is not valid")
    return engine_type
```
