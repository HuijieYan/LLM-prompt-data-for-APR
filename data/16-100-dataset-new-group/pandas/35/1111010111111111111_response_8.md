To fix the bug in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely before it is intended to. The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the AttributeError.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to self (PeriodIndex) is maintained throughout the usage of the _engine function.
2. Use the weakref.ref() function to create a weak reference to self and ensure that it is not prematurely dropped.

Based on the provided information, below is the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    ... # (other parameters as defined in the original code)
    ...
    """

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use weakref to create a weak reference to self
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        # Access the weakly referenced self, instead of self directly
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to self will be maintained and used to create the PeriodEngine, avoiding the premature drop of the weak reference.

This corrected version of the _engine function should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case.
