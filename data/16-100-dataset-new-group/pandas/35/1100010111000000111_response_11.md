## Analysis:
The `_engine` function is using weakref to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to the `_engine_type`. The issue seems to be related to the weak reference being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause:
The weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` is not being used correctly, leading to the weak reference being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The weak reference needs to be used correctly in the `_engine` function so that it is not dropped prematurely. One possible strategy is to ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by properly managing the weak reference's lifetime.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period_ref` is maintained until it is passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that it does not get dropped prematurely.

With the corrected _engine function, the failing test should now pass without raising an error.
