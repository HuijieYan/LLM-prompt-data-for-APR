### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `weakref` to avoid a reference cycle. The issue seems to be with creating the weak reference and using it to create the engine type.

#### Bug
The bug in the function `_engine` is likely due to the weak reference not being used correctly.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug
The weak reference needs to be handled properly to avoid the reference cycle. The best approach would be to use the weak reference to obtain the actual object when required and handle the lifecycle of the object appropriately.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
