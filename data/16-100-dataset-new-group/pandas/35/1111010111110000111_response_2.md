## The Analysis

1. The buggy function `_engine` is defined within the `PeriodIndex` class in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` as one of its levels, and then checks if the levels are monotonic. It fails due to a weak reference issue.
3. The failing test outputs an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the engine is not being weakly referenced causing `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. The problem seems to be with the weak reference used in the `_engine` function not being maintained properly, leading to an attribute error.
5. A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly and is not dropped before it's intended.



## The Fix

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Store the weak reference in an instance variable to prevent it from being garbage collected
    self._period_ref = period
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this version, we store the weak reference in an instance variable `_period_ref` to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely. This should address the issue and ensure that the weak reference is maintained correctly.
