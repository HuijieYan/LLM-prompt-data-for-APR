The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error occurs in the `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` line of code. This means that the `vgetter()` method is returning `None` instead of an object that has the `view` method, causing the AttributeError.

The issue lies in the `_engine` method, specifically in the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The `_engine_type` method is not correctly creating and returning an object that has the `vgetter` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method creates and returns the correct object that has the `vgetter` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type method did not create an engine object")
    return engine
```
