The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` because the `_engine_type` is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type. This is likely due to the weak reference `period` not being used correctly to create the `_engine_type` object.

To fix this bug, the weak reference `period` should be dereferenced before passing it to the `_engine_type` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing `period` with `period()`, the correct reference to the `self` object is passed to the `_engine_type`, ensuring it returns the expected type and resolves the AttributeError.
