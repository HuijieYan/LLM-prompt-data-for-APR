The buggy function "_engine" is a cache readonly method within the PeriodIndex class. It is intended to return an instance of the _engine_type class by passing a weak reference of itself to the _engine_type constructor. However, the bug in the function is that it is not passing the weak reference of itself to the _engine_type constructor, which can potentially lead to a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _engine function to correctly pass a weak reference of self to the _engine_type constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of just `period`, we are invoking the weak reference object to return the original reference, thereby avoiding any potential reference cycle.
