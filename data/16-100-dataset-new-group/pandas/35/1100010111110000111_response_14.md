The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to `self` and then use it to call the `_engine_type` method. However, the issue is that the weak reference is not being handled properly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`. When checking for monotonicity of the levels, an error is raised due to the weak reference issue.

To fix the bug, the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function needs to be revised to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref proxy to create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self`, the corrected version ensures that the weak reference is handled properly when passed to the `_engine_type` method.

This fix will resolve the issue raised in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
