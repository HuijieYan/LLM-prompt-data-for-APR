The buggy function is the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The function is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, which means it is meant to be cached after its initial computation.

The error message indicates that the bug is related to the `PeriodEngine` object that is returned by this `_engine` function. The error message specifically mentions that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_engine` function is returning a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object, rather than returning `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._engine_type('', 0)
```

In the corrected version, we perform a check to ensure that the `engine` object is not None. If it is None, we return a new `PeriodEngine` object with default values. This should ensure that the `_engine` function always returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object, fixing the bug.
