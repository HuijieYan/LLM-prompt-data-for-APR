The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is not returning the correct `_engine_type` instance, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should return the correct `_engine_type` instance, and ensure that the reference to `self` is properly maintained.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we assume that `PeriodEngine` is the correct `_engine_type` for the `PeriodIndex` class. If it's a different type, replace `PeriodEngine` with the appropriate type.

By returning the correct `_engine_type` instance, the AttributeError should no longer occur, and the failing test should pass.
