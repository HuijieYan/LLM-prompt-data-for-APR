The issue in the `_engine` function appears to be the return statement, specifically how `period` is being weakly referenced. This is leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be used to obtain the referenced object, then the `_engine_type` needs to be called with the obtained referenced object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` retrieves the original object from the weak reference `period`. Then it's passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. This should resolve the issue and make the function work as expected.
