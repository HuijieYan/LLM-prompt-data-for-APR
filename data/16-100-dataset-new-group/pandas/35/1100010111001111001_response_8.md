The bug in the _engine function is likely due to the incorrect usage of weakref.ref(self). This is leading to issues with the weak reference, and the return value from _engine_type might be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we can use the weakref.proxy() function instead of weakref.ref(). This will create a weak reference to the input object and return a proxy to it, allowing the original object to be garbage collected if there are no strong references to it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue with the weak reference and pass the failing test.
