The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` as a parameter. However, the implementation of `period = weakref.ref(self)` is incorrect.

The bug in the function is that it is not creating a weak reference to `self` properly. The line `period = weakref.ref(self)` should be `period = weakref.ref(self)`.

To fix this bug, we need to change the implementation of the `_engine` function as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

By making this change, the function will correctly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`, which should resolve the bug.

This corrected version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
