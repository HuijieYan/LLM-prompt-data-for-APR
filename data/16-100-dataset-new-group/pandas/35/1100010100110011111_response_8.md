## Identified Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is likely caused by the weak reference not being maintained properly, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is properly maintained and passed to the `_engine_type`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
In the corrected version, we use `period()` to retrieve the original `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference, ensuring that a NoneType object is not passed to the `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function returns the expected values and types.
