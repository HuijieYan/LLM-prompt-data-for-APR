## Analysis
The `_engine` function is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems that the weak reference is not being used correctly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

## Identified Error
The issue might be in how the weak reference `period` is being used or passed to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug
The weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex. This is preventing the expected output from being achieved.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
It seems like the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly, so it needs to be handled properly to ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the intended PeriodIndex. Additionally, the weak reference should be handled in a way that prevents it from being dropped prematurely.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
In the corrected version, `period` is called as a function to obtain the weakly referenced PeriodIndex before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the intended PeriodIndex without it being dropped prematurely.
