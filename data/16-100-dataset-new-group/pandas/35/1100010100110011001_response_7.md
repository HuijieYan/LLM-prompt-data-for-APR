The buggy function `_engine` uses `weakref.ref()` to generate a weak reference to `self` and then passes it to `self._engine_type()`. However, the error message indicates that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object, which leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The cause of this bug is that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref()` is not being properly dereferenced before being passed to `self._engine_type()`, so it is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be dereferenced using the `()` operator to obtain the actual object it refers to before passing it to `self._engine_type()`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)()` is used to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `self._engine_type()`. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the expected engine object instead of `None`.
