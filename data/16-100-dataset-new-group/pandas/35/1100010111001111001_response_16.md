The bug in the `_engine` function is that it creates a weak reference to `self` and then passes it to `self._engine_type` as an argument. This could potentially lead to the weak reference being collected prematurely, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should create a strong reference to `self` and pass it to `self._engine_type` instead of a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
