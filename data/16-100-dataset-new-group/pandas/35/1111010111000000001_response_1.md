The bug is likely occurring within the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The function sets up a weak reference to an instance of the class and then calls `_engine_type` with that weak reference and the length of the `PeriodIndex`. If `_engine_type` is not handling the weak reference properly, it could result in a reference cycle and potentially a memory leak.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should simply pass `self` to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
