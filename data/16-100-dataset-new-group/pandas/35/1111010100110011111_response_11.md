### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using a `weakref` to create a reference to the `self` object, but it seems like it is not being used correctly. The bug is causing an AttributeError due to the `NoneType` object not having the `view` attribute.
2. The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect usage of `weakref` and its relationship with the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object.
3. The expected output of the failing test is to return True, but it is currently failing with an AttributeError due to incorrect usage of weak references.
4. The bug can be fixed by correctly utilizing weak references and ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` object is not garbage collected prematurely.
5. The corrected version will need to properly use `weakref` to create a reference to `self` and ensure that it remains valid until no longer needed.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weakref_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref_self, len(self))
```
