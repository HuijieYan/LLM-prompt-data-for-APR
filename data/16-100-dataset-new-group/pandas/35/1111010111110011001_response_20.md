From the error message, it seems the bug is related to the `_engine` property of the `PeriodIndex` class. This is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

The `_engine` method is using `@cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests it's trying to cache the result of its computation but it's returning `None` instead of an actual value. This causes the later failure when the `_engine` is accessed and expected to have a `vgetter()` method. 

The `_engine` method needs to be fixed such that it returns a valid engine object, rather than `None`.

One approach to fix this bug is to create an actual engine object and return it from the `_engine` method, ensuring that it is properly cached and accessible when required.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This should address the issue where the `_engine` method returns `None` and ensures that a valid engine object is returned and cached properly.
