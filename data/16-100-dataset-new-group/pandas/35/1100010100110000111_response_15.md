There are multiple issues with the `_engine` function. The error message suggests that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', which indicates that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected type. 

Also, the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" states that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is retained and passed to the `_engine_type` correctly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct expected type instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Retain weak reference of self to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type returned None")
    return engine
```

By retaining the weak reference and checking for `None` before returning, we can ensure that the bug is fixed and the function will return the correct engine type without dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`. This should also resolve the failing test and address the issue posted on GitHub.
