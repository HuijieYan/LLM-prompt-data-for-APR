The buggy function `_engine` is causing an `AttributeError` when the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is executed. The failing test is trying to check if all the levels of the MultiIndex `idx2` are monotonic, but it fails due to an issue with the `_engine` function, specifically with the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is returning `NoneType` instead of an expected value. This raises an `AttributeError` when the failing test tries to access the `view` attribute of the returned object.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure it returns a valid object that has the necessary attributes and methods.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```

By adding a check for `self._engine_type` to see if it is not `None`, we can prevent the function from returning `NoneType`. This should ensure that the corrected function handles the `self._engine_type` attribute appropriately and returns a valid object, resolving the `AttributeError` encountered in the failing test.
