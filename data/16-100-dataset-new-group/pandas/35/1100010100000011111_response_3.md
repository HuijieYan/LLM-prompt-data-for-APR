Based on the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue, the bug in the function `_engine` is caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` should be maintained until the intended point of use. This can be achieved by modifying the function to hold a reference to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` until it is used to create the `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a reference to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is stored as an attribute of the object (`self._period_ref`) to maintain the reference until it is used to create the `PeriodEngine`. This ensures that the `PeriodEngine` does not receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, resolving the bug.
