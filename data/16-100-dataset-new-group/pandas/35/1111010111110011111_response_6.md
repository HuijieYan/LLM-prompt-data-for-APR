The buggy function `_engine` is causing an AttributeError when accessing the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object. This indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of a `PeriodIndex` as intended.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the weak referencing used in the `_engine` function. Weak referencing is a way to keep a reference to an object without preventing it from being garbage collected. However, in this case, it seems that the weak reference is not being maintained properly, resulting in the observed error.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` instance) needs to be maintained correctly so that it does not get garbage collected prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:  # Check if the weak reference is still valid
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is no longer available")
```

In this version, the weakly referenced `self` is checked to ensure that it is still valid before creating the engine. If the weak reference is no longer available, a `ValueError` is raised. This ensures that the engine is only created if the weak reference to `self` is still alive.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
