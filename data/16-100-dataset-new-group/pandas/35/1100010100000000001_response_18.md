## Analyze the Bug

The buggy function `_engine` uses a `weakref` to create a reference to the `self` object, but it is not being used correctly.

## Identify Potential Error Locations

The potential error in the buggy function is the use of the `weakref` and the way it's being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Explain the Cause of the Bug

The cause of the bug is that the `weakref` is not being used appropriately to avoid a reference cycle. The reference to `self` should be weak to prevent unnecessary retention of objects in memory.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to `self` and pass that weak reference to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle and properly manage memory usage.

## Corrected Version

```python
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
