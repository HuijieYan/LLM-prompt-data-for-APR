The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference to store the PeriodIndex object, but the weak reference is not being called correctly in the `_engine_type` constructor. This results in an AttributeError when the `vgetter` method is called in the failing test. 

To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference properly and handle the case where the weak reference is None.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self is not None else self._engine_type()
```
