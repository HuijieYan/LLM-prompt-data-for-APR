The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing a `NoneType` error when accessed by the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

The cause of the bug is due to the weak reference (`period = weakref.ref(self)`) being passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be resolved properly, and the reference to the `PeriodIndex` should be maintained until the engine has finished using it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Avoid a reference cycle by maintaining the reference to self during engine usage
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By maintaining a reference to `self` during the execution of the `_engine_type`, the weak reference issue should be resolved, and the `NoneType` error should no longer occur. This should fix the bug and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
