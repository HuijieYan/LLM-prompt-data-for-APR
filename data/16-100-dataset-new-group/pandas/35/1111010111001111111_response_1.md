The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, within the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`. The function is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it's not being used correctly, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

The cause of the bug is that in the `_engine` function, a weak reference to `self` is being passed to the `_engine_type` without checking if it has been collected. This results in the `_engine_type` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference correctly. We can use the `weakref.proxy` function to create a weak reference proxy for `self` and pass it to the `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is still available when needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weak reference proxy to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy`, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is still available when passed to `_engine_type`.

This fix will resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` object, allowing the failing test case to pass.
