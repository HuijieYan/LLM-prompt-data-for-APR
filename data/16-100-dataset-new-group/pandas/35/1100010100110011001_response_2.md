The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. The error message points to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the `_engine` function is not returning the expected value and is in fact returning `None`.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not being properly used to create the `_PeriodEngine` instance. This results in the `_engine` function returning `None` instead of the expected instance of `_PeriodEngine`. 

To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` should be used to create the `_PeriodEngine` instance correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type.__get__(period, type(self))(len(self))
```

This corrected version should properly create the `_PeriodEngine` instance using the weak reference to `self` and avoid returning `None`. After this correction, the function should return the expected instance of `_PeriodEngine`, resolving the `AttributeError` and passing the failing test.
