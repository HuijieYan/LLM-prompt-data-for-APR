The bug in the `_engine` function is that it attempts to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self` but is not passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor correctly.

The correct approach is to pass the weak reference to the constructor as an argument.

To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, the corrected version is provided below:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to the constructor
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
