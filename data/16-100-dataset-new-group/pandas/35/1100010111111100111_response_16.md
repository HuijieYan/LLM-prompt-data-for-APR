To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped before intended and that the PeriodEngine does not receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. 

The cause of the bug is that the `weakref.ref(self)` is not being used correctly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_engine` function as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)`, we create a proxy to the original object and the original object is kept alive as long as the proxy is alive. This ensures that the PeriodEngine will receive the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
