### Analysis:
The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.

### Potential Error Location:
The `_engine` function seems to be returning the engine type with a weak reference to `self`, but the weak reference may not be maintained properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is getting dropped before it is intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in the AttributeError when trying to call `view("i8")`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The fix should involve ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly within the `_engine` function and does not get dropped prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

In the corrected version, we check if the weakly referenced `self` is not `None` before returning the engine type, ensuring that the weak reference is maintained properly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
