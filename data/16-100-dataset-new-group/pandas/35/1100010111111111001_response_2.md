The issue in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference object `period`. It appears that the weak reference object is not being used correctly, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The bug seems to be caused by using a weak reference improperly, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to properly use weak references to avoid reference cycles and ensure that the weakly referenced object is still available when needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

By calling the weak reference object as a function `()` before returning its value, we ensure that the weakly referenced object is still available and prevent the AttributeError.
