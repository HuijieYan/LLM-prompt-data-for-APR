## Explanation
The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to avoid a reference cycle, but it is not being used correctly. This is causing the weakly-referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before it is intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is causing the failing test in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weakref should be used correctly to ensure that the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely. Additionally, the `_engine_type` function should be checked to ensure that it can handle the weakly-referenced PeriodIndex properly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weakly-referenced PeriodIndex will not be dropped prematurely, and the PeriodEngine will receive the intended PeriodIndex. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
