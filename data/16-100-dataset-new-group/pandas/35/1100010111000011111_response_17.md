```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# fix for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```
In the original function, the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` does not actually create an instance of the engine. It should be `self._engine_type(period, len(self))()` to call the constructor and return an instance of the engine.

The fixed version of the function should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
