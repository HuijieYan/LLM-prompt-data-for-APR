To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly so that it is not dropped prematurely. One approach to achieve this is to use a `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. This will allow the weak reference to continue pointing to `self` even after the original reference has been removed. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we maintain a weak reference to `self` inside the `_engine` function, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
