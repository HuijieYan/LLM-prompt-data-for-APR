The buggy function `_engine` fails to return the correct object, leading to an `AttributeError` in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is returning a weak reference instead of the actual object, causing unexpected behavior in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should return the actual object instead of a weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
