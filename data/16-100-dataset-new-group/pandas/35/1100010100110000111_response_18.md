### Fixing the bug

#### Analysis:
The error message indicates an AttributeError due to a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_engine` function is returning a `None` type object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object. The GitHub issue also confirms that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

#### Potential error location:
The potential error is likely within the `_engine` function where it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that the weak reference to `self` is not being preserved as intended.

#### Bug cause:
The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, resulting in the AttributeError.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is preserved and not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak referencing of `self`.

#### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we modified `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self)` where `self` is called as a function with `()` to retrieve the original reference. This ensures that the weak reference to `self` is properly preserved and accessed when passing to `_engine_type`.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should resolve the weak reference issue and return the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test, resolve the issue posted in GitHub, and provide the expected output.
