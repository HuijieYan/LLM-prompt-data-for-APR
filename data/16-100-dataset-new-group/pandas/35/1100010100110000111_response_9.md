Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex. The error message indicates that the 'PeriodEngine' is getting a 'NoneType' object instead of the intended PeriodIndex, causing an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained properly and is not being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    return engine_type
```

In the corrected version, I explicitly call the weak reference 'period' to get the reference to the PeriodIndex and pass it to '_engine_type' to ensure it does not get dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue and allow the test to pass successfully.
