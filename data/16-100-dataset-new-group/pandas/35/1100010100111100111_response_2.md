The issue with the buggy function is that `period` is being set as a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being passed to the `_engine_type` function correctly. This is causing the `_engine` function to return a `NoneType` object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly passed to the `_engine_type` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are passing `self` directly to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference is not lost and the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the tests pass without any AttributeErrors.
