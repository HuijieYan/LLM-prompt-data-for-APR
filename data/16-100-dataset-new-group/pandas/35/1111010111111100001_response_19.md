The bug seems to be in the _engine method of the PeriodIndex class. The method is using weakref to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance, but it is not being used correctly, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access a view attribute on a NoneType object.

The cause of this bug is that the weak reference period is not being properly used when creating the _engine instance in the cache_readonly decorator. This causes the _engine method to return a NoneType object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access attributes on it.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be properly utilized to prevent reference cycles and ensure that the _engine_type instance is created with the correct reference to the PeriodIndex object.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This correction uses weakref.ref to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance and then calls it to obtain the actual reference, preventing the creation of a NoneType object and fixing the AttributeError issue.
