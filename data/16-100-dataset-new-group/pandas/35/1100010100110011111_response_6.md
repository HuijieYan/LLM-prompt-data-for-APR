## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This is likely due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.

## Bug Cause
The `_engine` function should create a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex`), and then pass that weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor. However, it seems that the weak reference is not being properly maintained, resulting in a `None` being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is correctly maintained and passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. This may involve making changes to the way the weak reference is created and used within the `_engine` function.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to self
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
