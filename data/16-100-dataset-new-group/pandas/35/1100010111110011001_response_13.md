The given buggy function is a method `_engine` within `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` that is using the `cache_readonly` decorator. It appears to be using a weak reference `period` of `self` to initialize the `_engine_type` of the PeriodIndex.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then attempts to assert that all level values are monotonic.

The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

This error is likely due to an issue with the weak reference `period` of `self` not being properly handled within the `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly initialized and used within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weak reference `period` is appropriately utilized, avoiding the AttributeError.
