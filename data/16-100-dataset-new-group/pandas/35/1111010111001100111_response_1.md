The buggy function `_engine` appears to be a cached readonly property function that returns an instance of `_engine_type` class after passing a weak reference of `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) and its length. The issue seems to be that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the caching mechanism for the `_engine` property needs to be checked to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):

    # ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)

    @property
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this corrected code, the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained, and the issue reported in the GitHub post should be resolved.
