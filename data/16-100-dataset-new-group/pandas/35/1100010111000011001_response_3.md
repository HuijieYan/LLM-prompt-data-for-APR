The buggy function `_engine` should accept a parameter `self` of type `Period` and return an `_engine_type` object.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the `_engine` function does not properly handle the weak reference to `self`. This can cause issues when accessing the weak reference in the `_engine_type` function, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be properly handled to ensure that it correctly references `self` without causing any reference cycle issues.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
In the corrected version, the `period` weak reference is now correctly accessed using `period()`, and the length `len(self)` is passed to the `_engine_type` function. This ensures that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled without causing any reference cycle issues.
