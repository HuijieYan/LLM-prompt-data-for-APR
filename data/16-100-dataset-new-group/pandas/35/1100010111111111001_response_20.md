The bug in the given function is that it is returning the weak reference `period` instead of the actual object. This is causing a NoneType error when the "_engine_type" tries to access the weak reference.

To fix this bug, we need to return the actual object instead of the weak reference. We can do this by using the `period()` method of the weak reference object to get the actual object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return period()
```

By returning the actual object using the `period()` method, we ensure that the weak reference is dereferenced and the correct object is returned. This should fix the NoneType error and resolve the bug.
