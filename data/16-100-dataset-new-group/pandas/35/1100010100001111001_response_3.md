The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly creating a weak reference to the `self` parameter. Instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`, it should be using `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that a weak reference to the `self` object is properly created, avoiding any reference cycles.

This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
