### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of the `self` object to `_engine_type` and then returning the result. The error message indicates that there is an 'AttributeError' related to 'NoneType' object, suggesting that the weak reference is not being handled correctly, resulting in the `NoneType` error.

### Bug Cause:
The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is being dropped before it's intended to, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the 'AttributeError' when accessing the `view` attribute.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference of `self` is correctly handled and that it does not become a `None` object when passed to `_engine_type`.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:  # Check if the weak reference is valid
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case where the weak reference is no longer valid
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to object is no longer valid")
```

By checking if the weak reference `period()` is not `None` before using it, we ensure that the reference is still valid and prevent the 'AttributeError' related to 'NoneType' object. If it's not valid, a `RuntimeError` is raised, indicating that the weak reference to the object is no longer valid. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
