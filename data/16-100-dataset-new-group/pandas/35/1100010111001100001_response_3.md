The issue in the provided buggy function is that it is not correctly creating a weak reference to the 'self' object before passing it to '_engine_type'. This can lead to a reference cycle and potential memory leaks.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to 'self' is not being correctly passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in a potential reference cycle and memory leaks. This can lead to unexpected behavior and memory consumption.

To fix the bug, the function should create a weak reference to 'self' and then pass it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

The corrected version of the function includes passing the weak reference 'period' to `_engine_type` and using the correct length of the data (self._data) instead of the length of the object itself.

With this correction, the function should now correctly create a weak reference to 'self' and pass it to `_engine_type`, avoiding a reference cycle and potential memory leaks. The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
