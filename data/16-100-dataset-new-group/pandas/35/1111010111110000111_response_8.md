## Analysis
The `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the bug. It uses the `cache_readonly` decorator, and it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` er drops before intended, which causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This behavior violates the expected output and leads to the AttributeError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` needs to be handled correctly within the `_engine` function to ensure that it is still valid when it is accessed by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by modifying the weak reference handling or by ensuring that the weak reference doesn't expire before it's accessed by the `PeriodEngine`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```
By using `weakref.proxy`, a strong reference to `self` is created, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to `self`. This should address the weak reference issue and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
