The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference usage. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` may not be functioning as intended, leading to unexpected behavior. 

The `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference to the `self` object, but it does not prevent `self` from being garbage collected if there are no other references to it. This could lead to the `_engine` function returning an invalid reference.

A potential fix for this issue is to use a closure to capture `self` in a way that prevents the reference cycle, rather than relying on `weakref.ref`. This can be achieved by defining a local function within `_engine` that captures `self` as a nonlocal variable.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Define a local function to capture self as a nonlocal variable
    def create_engine(period_index, length):
        return self._engine_type(period_index, length)

    return create_engine(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In this fix, the `create_engine` function captures `self` as a nonlocal variable, preventing a reference cycle. The `weakref.proxy` is used to create a weak reference to `self` without the risk of it being garbage collected.

With this corrected version of the `_engine` function, it should pass the failing test.
