## The buggy function fixed

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The issue in the original code was the weakref creation `period = weakref.ref(self)`. In the corrected code, the weak reference `period` is immediately called, which resolves the issue of weakrefs being dropped before intended. 

The corrected version of the function should fix the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
