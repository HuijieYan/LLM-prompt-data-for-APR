The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` class. However, the current implementation is not properly creating a weak reference to `self`.

The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is incorrectly created using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `weakref.proxy(self)`. As a result, the `_engine_type` is not receiving a weak reference and may lead to potential reference cycle issues.

To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref(self)` should be replaced with `weakref.proxy(self)` to properly create a weak reference to `self`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
