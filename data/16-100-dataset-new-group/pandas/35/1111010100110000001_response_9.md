In the given code, the `_engine` function seems to be the cause of the error. The error message suggests that the `PeriodEngine` is returning a `NoneType` object, which does not have the attribute `view`.

Based on this information, there are a few potential error locations within the `_engine` function:
1. The `period` variable might not be assigned as intended.
2. The `self._engine_type` function might not be returning the expected object.

To fix this bug:
- First, we need to ensure that the `period` variable is correctly assigned as a weakref to `self` in the `_engine` function.
- Second, we need to verify that the `_engine_type` function is returning a valid object.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is None:
        raise Exception("_engine_type returned a NoneType object")
    return engine_type
```

This correction adds an additional check to ensure that the `_engine_type` function is returning a non-None object. If it is None, an exception will be raised to indicate that the `_engine_type` function needs to be investigated for potential issues.
