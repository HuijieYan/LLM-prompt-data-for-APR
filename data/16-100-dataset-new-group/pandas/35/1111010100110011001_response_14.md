The buggy function `_engine` is a cache_readonly function that is intended to return a new instance of `PeriodEngine` initialized with a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance and its length.

The error message indicates an AttributeError when the engine is trying to retrieve the index values, suggesting that the `_engine` function may not be returning the correct type of engine or may not be properly initialized.

The cause of the bug is likely due to an incorrect initialization or return value of the `_engine` function, resulting in the PeriodEngine instance being of type `None` instead of the expected type.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that it properly initializes and returns an instance of the desired class `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The buggy function you need to fix
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```
