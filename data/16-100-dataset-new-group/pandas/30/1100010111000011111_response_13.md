The issue with the function `_try_convert_to_date` is that it incorrectly converts boolean values into timestamps instead of maintaining them as boolean values. This leads to unexpected behavior when attempting to parse a Series of booleans from a JSON input.

The cause of the bug is that the function tries to convert boolean values into timestamps, leading to a result that is inconsistent with the expected behavior. The function should not attempt to convert boolean values to timestamps.

To fix the bug, the function should check the data type before attempting any conversions, and if the input data is a boolean type, it should return the data as is without performing any additional operations or conversions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False  # Return boolean values as is without conversion

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle boolean values and return them as expected, without converting them into timestamps. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test case.
