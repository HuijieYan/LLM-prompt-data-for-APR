The cause of the bug identified from the GitHub issue is that when using `pd.read_json('[true, true, false]', typ="series")`, the expected output would be a Pandas Series of bools. However, in older Pandas versions, it resulted in a Series of datetime objects instead of bools. Since version 1.0.0, it raises a TypeError. This is inconsistent with the behavior of `typ="frame"`, and the expected output should be a Series of bools. 

The identified potential error location within the buggy function is in the `new_data.dtype == "object"` condition, which is trying to convert the data to `"int64"` to coerce object types into epoch/iso formats and integer/float into epoch formats.

The strategy for fixing this bug involves ensuring that the function correctly identifies the input data type and does not convert it to another type, as the input type is expected to be boolean. It should then handle the boolean data appropriately without trying to convert it to a different type.

Here is the corrected version of the function based on the analysis and bug fix strategy:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        if new_data.dtype == "object" and all(isinstance(val, (int, float)) for val in new_data):
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        else:
            new_data = new_data.astype("datetime64[ns]")

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function should correctly handle boolean input data and return a Series of boolean values as expected.
