## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the function incorrectly converting boolean values into datetime values, leading to the creation of a Series of timestamps instead of a Series of boolean values. To fix this bug, the function should only attempt to convert the input data into datetime values if the input data is in a format that can be parsed as a date. If the input data is already in a suitable format for a date conversion (e.g., epoch/iso formats), the function should perform the date conversion. Otherwise, it should return the input data unchanged.

The `if` condition checks if the input data is an empty array and simply returns the input data and `False` without attempting any conversion. This is appropriate behavior for an empty array, so this part does not need to be changed.

The first potential error location is the attempt to coerce the input data to `int64` if the data type is "object." This conversion should only be attempted if the data is in a suitable format for a numerical conversion (e.g., epoch/iso formats). Otherwise, this conversion should not be performed.

The second potential error location is the attempt to convert the data to datetime within the for loop. This logic seems to be incorrect as it is not correctly handling the conversion for boolean data, leading to the issue reported on GitHub.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly identify the data format and perform appropriate conversions based on that format.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        # Check if the data can be coerced to int64
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        else:
            # If successful, return the coerced data with success flag
            return new_data, True

    elif issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    # check for valid date formats before attempting to convert
    if self.date_unit:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:
        for date_unit in self._STAMP_UNITS:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

    # If none of the conversions were successful, return the original data with False
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version of the function, the logic to handle each data format is improved. The function now correctly identifies the data format and attempts appropriate conversions based on that format. If none of the conversions are successful, it returns the original data with a `False` flag to indicate that the parsing was unsuccessful. This approach addresses the bug described in the GitHub issue and should lead to the expected behavior for the function.
