The buggy function in question is `_try_convert_to_date()`, which is part of the pandas IO JSON module. This function is intended to parse an ndarray into a date column in accordance with specific date parsing formats. However, the function currently has a bug that causes it to return incorrect results when trying to coerce boolean values into datetime values.

The bug occurs due to incorrect type conversions and condition checks within the function. The issue posted on GitHub describes a specific case where using the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` and providing a JSON list of bools resulted in the function returning a series of datetimes instead of the expected series of bools. The expected behavior is consistent with the behavior when using `typ="frame"` or setting `convert_dates` to `False`, where the function correctly outputs a series of boolean values.

To fix the bug, the type conversion of the input data needs to be handled correctly and the condition checks need to be adjusted to support the parsing of boolean values as expected.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers and booleans that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, (np.number, np.bool_)):
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
        else:  # handle boolean values
            in_range = np.full_like(new_data, True)
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, the function now correctly handles boolean values as a separate data type and checks for out-of-range values accordingly. Additionally, the exception handling within the date parsing logic has been adjusted to address the issue with boolean values. With these corrections, the function should now return the expected series of boolean values when using `read_json` with `typ="series"`.
