The bug in the provided `read_json` function is causing a TypeError when trying to parse a list of booleans into a Pandas Series. The bug is related to the `_try_convert_to_date` method within the `Parser` class which incorrectly tries to convert the list of booleans into a datetime format.

The cause of the bug is that the `_try_convert_to_date` method is being called even when the input is not a date format. This results in the method attempting to convert non-datetime data to a datetime format, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` method to check the input data type before attempting to convert it to a datetime format. If the input data is already a datetime, the method should return the original data and a flag for successful parsing. If the data is not a datetime format, it should return the original data and a False flag indicating that the parsing was not successful.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
class Parser():
    # ... (other class methods)

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == "datetime64":
            return data, True
        else:
            return data, False
```

With this modification, the `_try_convert_to_date` method will correctly check the data type and only attempt to convert to a date format if the input is not already in that format. This should resolve the TypeError that was occurring when trying to parse a list of booleans into a Pandas Series.
