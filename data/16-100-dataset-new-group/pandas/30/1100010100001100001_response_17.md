The issue in the buggy function is that it incorrectly converts the data to int64 and checks for out-of-range numbers, which is not intended based on the given input parameter values and types. Additionally, the logic for parsing date units seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary conversion to int64 and modify the logic for parsing date units. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    # parse the data as datetime
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

With this correction, we remove the unnecessary conversion to int64 and simply try to parse the data as datetime using `to_datetime`. If successful, it returns the parsed data and True, otherwise, it returns the original data and False.
