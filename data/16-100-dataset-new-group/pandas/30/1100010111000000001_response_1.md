## Analysis
The `_try_convert_to_date` function is intended to convert a data array into a date column and return a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful. The function first checks if the input data is empty and if not, it attempts to convert the data into integer format if it is of type "object". Then it checks for numbers that are out of range and finally tries to convert the data into datetime using different date units.

## Identified Potential Error Locations
1. The attempt to convert data into integer format using `data.astype("int64")` may not work as expected for all types of input data.
2. The check for numbers that are out of range seems to be incomplete.
3. The loop for trying different date units may result in incorrect conversion.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function may be caused by incorrect data type conversion, incomplete check for numbers out of range, and potential issues in the date conversion loop.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Use a more robust method to convert the data into integer format if it is of type "object".
2. Improve the check for numbers that are out of range to accurately identify the data that is out of range.
3. Ensure that the datetime conversion loop is properly handled to correctly convert the data.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    try:
        new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')
    except ValueError:
        new_data = data

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data) | (new_data <= self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='raise', unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

With these changes, the function should be able to correctly handle the data type conversion, check for numbers that are out of range, and accurately convert the data into datetime. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
