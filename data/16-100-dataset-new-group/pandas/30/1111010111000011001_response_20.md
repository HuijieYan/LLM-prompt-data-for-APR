The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the data type when trying to parse a ndarray into a date column. Additionally, there are issues with the conditions for checking the range of numbers and converting to datetime.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the data type conversion and checking for out-of-range numbers, leading to incorrect parsing of the input data as a date.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data type conversion and range checking are performed accurately. Additionally, the function should handle the input properly and return the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce').astype("Int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    in_range = (
        isna(new_data)
        | (new_data >= self.min_stamp)
    )

    if not in_range.all():
        return data, False
    
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce")
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
    
    return new_data, True
```

In the corrected version, we apply `pd.to_numeric` to handle conversion to numeric values for object dtypes, and correct the range checking using boolean indexing. Additionally, we use `to_datetime` with `errors="coerce"` to handle datetime conversion with coercion.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
