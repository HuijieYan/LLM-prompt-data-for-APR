### Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is being called during the execution of `pd.read_json` when the `typ` parameter is set to "series". It is meant to parse an ndarray-like object into a date column. However, the error message indicates that the function is attempting to convert a bool to datetime, which is not supported. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, where the user expects a Series of bools but is instead getting an error related to datetime conversion.

### Potential Error Locations
The error might be occurring in the block where the function tries to convert the input data to datetime using the `to_datetime` function. It's likely that the data type is not being checked properly before attempting the conversion.

### Cause of the Bug
The buggy function attempts to convert input data to datetime without properly handling different data types. As a result, when the input data is a boolean, it causes a TypeError because a boolean is not convertible to datetime.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should first check the type of the input data. If it's a boolean, it should perform the necessary logic to convert it to a Series of bools instead of trying to convert it to datetime.

### Corrected Version
Based on the analysis, here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False
    else:
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This version adds a check for boolean data types and returns the data with a boolean flag if the input data is a boolean. This should ensure that bool inputs are handled correctly and not converted to datetime, fixing the error indicated in the GitHub issue.
