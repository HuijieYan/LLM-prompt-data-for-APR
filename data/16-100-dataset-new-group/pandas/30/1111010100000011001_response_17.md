The bug in the given function is that it fails to convert the data to a date column and return the correct boolean value.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. The `if` condition for checking the length of data could potentially cause an error if the type of data is not suitable for the `len` function.
2. The `try` block to convert the data to `int64` could potentially raise a TypeError, ValueError, or OverflowError.
3. The check for numbers that are out of range might not be correctly handling the conditions and could lead to an incorrect return value.
4. The conversion of data to datetime and the subsequent return of the new_data might not be correctly handling the date parsing and raising the correct errors.

The bug in the function is caused by incorrect handling of the data to convert it to a date column and the incorrect assignment of the boolean value for successful parsing.

To fix the bug, I would suggest:
1. Adding a check for the data type before finding its length to avoid potential errors.
2. Handle the exceptions raised in the `try` block to convert the data to `int64`.
3. Revise the check for numbers that are out of range and handle the conditions properly.
4. Ensure that the conversion of data to datetime is correctly handling the date parsing and raising the correct errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not isinstance(data, np.ndarray) and not isinstance(data, Series):
        raise ValueError("Input data must be a numpy array or pandas Series")
    
    # no conversion on empty
    if data.size == 0:
        return data, False
    
    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data) 
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp) 
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False
    
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, I added a check for the type of input data, handled the exceptions in the `try` block, revised the condition for checking the numbers that are out of range, and ensured that the conversion to datetime is handled correctly. This version should satisfy the expected input/output values.
