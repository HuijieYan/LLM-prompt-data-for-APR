## Correction of the buggy function

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object" and not isinstance(new_data.iloc[0], bool):
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if isinstance(new_data.iloc[0], (int, float)):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            new_data = data
            return new_data, False
    
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

## Explanation:
The buggy function failed to correctly identify and convert data to datetime if it was initially in an object or integer/float format. Also, the function did not handle boolean values correctly. The bug caused the function to return unexpected results and raise a TypeError when a Series of boolean values was provided.

To fix this issue, the following changes were made:
1. To handle boolean values correctly, a condition was added to skip conversion if the data is boolean.
2. Another condition was added to handle integer or float data types separately by checking the type of the first element in the series.
3. If the data is found to be out of range, the function now reverts the data back and returns False.
4. Finally, the function will now correctly attempt to convert the data to datetime based on the specified date_unit.

These changes should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and provide the expected output for the provided test cases.
