The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` has a few issues that need to be addressed.

The first issue is that the `if not len(data)` condition is not handling empty lists correctly. In Python, an empty list will have a length of 0, which is considered as False in boolean context. Hence, the condition should be `if not data.any()` to check if the array is not empty.

The second issue is that the comparison and transformation of the data types is not being handled correctly. In the case where the data type is "object", the function attempts to convert it to "int64" without checking if the data can be successfully converted. It should handle this conversion more explicitly, and check for successful conversion before proceeding.

The third issue is with the comparison of the data to `self.min_stamp` and `iNaT`, which is not consistent with the expected behavior of the function. The conditions should be refined to accurately determine if the values are in range or not.

Lastly, there is an issue with the handling of date units and the conversion to datetime, as the function is not trying all different date units before returning a result. It should try all available date units before giving up and returning the original data.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle these issues and produce the expected outputs.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not data.any():
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors='coerce')
                if new_data.isna().any():
                    return data, False
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        in_range = (
            isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we made the following changes:
1. Updated the condition to check if the array is not empty using `if not data.any()`.
2. Explicitly handled the conversion of "object" type to "int64" using `pd.to_numeric`.
3. Refactored the comparison logic to accurately determine if the values are in range or not.
4. Modified the looping structure to try all date units before returning a result.

The corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
