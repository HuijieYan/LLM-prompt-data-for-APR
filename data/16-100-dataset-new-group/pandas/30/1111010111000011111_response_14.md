The issue reported on GitHub describes a problem with the `read_json` function with `typ="series"`, where passing a JSON list of bools results in timestamps or exceptions. The expected output is a Pandas Series of bools, but in older versions, it returns timestamps. Since version 1.0.0, it raises a TypeError instead.

The cause of the bug is in the `_try_convert_to_date` method of the `Parser` class, where the code incorrectly attempts to parse Boolean values as dates. This results in the incorrect type conversion of the input data. The expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, but the function erroneously processes the input data as dates.

To fix this bug, we need to check the data type of the input and transform it directly to a Series of the appropriate dtype, performing minimal and necessary operations for conversion, without attempting to interpret boolean values as dates.

Below, you'll find the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
class Parser():
    # Fixed and corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        new_data = data.copy()  # Make a copy of the data to avoid modifying the original array
        
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("bool")  # Convert object type to boolean directly
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        return new_data, True  # Return the converted data and a boolean indicating successful parsing
```

With this corrected function, the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` should return a Pandas Series of bools, resolving the reported issue on GitHub.
