The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` seems to be related to a GitHub issue where the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools results in timestamps/Exception, which is inconsistent with the expected output and behavior of the function. The function is trying to parse an ndarray-like object into a date column, but it is currently failing to do so and causing unexpected behavior in the `read_json` function.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect handling of empty data at the beginning of the function.
2. Incorrect handling of the data type when converting to int64.
3. Incorrect handling of numerical values that are out of range.
4. Incorrect handling of converting the data to datetime.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling different data types and values when trying to convert to a date column. This is causing the `read_json` function to produce unexpected output and inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to:
1. Properly handle empty data by returning early.
2. Ensure that the data type is handled correctly when attempting to convert to `int64`.
3. Properly handle numerical values that are out of range.
4. Ensure that the data is converted to datetime correctly by handling different edge cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _try_convert_to_date function
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):  # return early if data is empty
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")  # fixed data conversion to int64
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)  # changed errors to "coerce"
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In this corrected version:
1. Empty data is properly handled at the beginning of the function.
2. Data is converted to `int64` with proper error handling.
3. Numerical values that are out of range are properly handled.
4. Data is converted to datetime using the "coerce" option, and different edge cases are considered.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and provide the expected output for the `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools in the `read_json` function.
