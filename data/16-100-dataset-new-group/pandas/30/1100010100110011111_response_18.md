## The bug and its cause

The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is not correctly handling the input data, which is a list of boolean values. The function is attempting to convert the boolean values to dates by coercing them into integer values and then attempting to convert them to datetime with a specified date unit. This is causing a TypeError because boolean values cannot be converted to datetime.

The function is also comparing the new data to a minimum timestamp, which is unnecessary for boolean values, leading to additional errors.

## Bug fixes

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values separately and return a Series of boolean values without attempting to convert them to datetime.

We also need to remove the unnecessary comparison to a minimum timestamp for the boolean data.

## The corrected function

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, True

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this correction, the function will return the input data as-is if it is a boolean array, and will handle other data types to convert them to datetime as before. This will ensure that the function handles boolean values appropriately and resolves the TypeError issue.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
