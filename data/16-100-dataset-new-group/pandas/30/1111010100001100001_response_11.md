The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be that it is incorrectly returning the original `data` instead of the `new_data` in some cases. This is likely due to the incorrect logic in the if statement related to the `in_range` check. 

The bug may be in the comparison `new_data._values == iNaT` as it is comparing the entire array of `new_data._values` with `iNaT`. This comparison might not yield the expected results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the code to return the `new_data` instead of the original `data` in the cases where the parsing was successful. We can also update the logic related to the `in_range` check, as the comparisons involving `iNaT` and the direct comparison of the dtype may not be accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, we removed the comparison with `iNaT` and changed the logic related to the `in_range` check. We also modified the return statements to return the `new_data` instead of the original `data` in cases where the parsing was successful.
