The issue is related to the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` producing unexpected results when reading a JSON list of booleans, specifically resulting in datetime types or raising a TypeError. The expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, and this problem has been observed since version 1.0.0. The bug is inconsistent with the behavior when `typ="frame"` and also when `convert_dates` is set to False.

The code within the `_try_convert_to_date` function is attempting to coerce the input values into timestamp units and then convert them to datetime. The bug is caused by the attempted conversion in the presence of boolean data, leading to unexpected outputs and inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, the coercion of boolean values to int should be skipped, and the function should directly return the input data as a Series of bools when the input is a Series of boolean values.

Here's a corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a Series-like input into date columns, returning the input as is if it's not in an expected format.
    """
    if not len(data):  # no need for conversion on empty data
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, True  # directly return the boolean Series

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

            date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
            for date_unit in date_units:
                try:
                    new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                    return new_data, True
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    continue
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the input data is of dtype "bool" and directly returns it as is if it is. Then, it proceeds with coercion to int64 and subsequent conversion to datetime if the input data is of dtype "object". This should avoid the unexpected conversions and always produce the expected output.
