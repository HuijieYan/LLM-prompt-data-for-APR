The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is causing the `read_json` function to fail when attempting to convert a list of boolean values to a Series. The error message indicates that it's trying to convert a boolean to a datetime, which is not the expected behavior.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The attempt to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats.
2. The check for numbers that are out of range.
3. The loop through date units and the conversion attempt using `to_datetime`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is attempting to convert boolean values into datetime using the `to_datetime` function, which results in a TypeError. This behavior contradicts the expected outcome of obtaining a Series of boolean values from the `read_json` function. This was also reported as a GitHub issue, which confirms the unexpected behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values as a special case and return the original data along with a boolean indicating success.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column.

    Try to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean indicating if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.bool_):  # new condition for boolean values
        return data, False  # return original data and indicate failure

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle boolean values as a special case, return the original data, and indicate failure. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `read_json` function can correctly convert a list of boolean values to a Series.
