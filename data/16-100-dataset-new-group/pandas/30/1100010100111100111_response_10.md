The issue with the provided buggy function is that it is incorrectly trying to convert boolean values into datetime objects, which is not the expected behavior and is leading to a TypeError. This behavior is inconsistent with the "frame" case and results in an unexpected output.

The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is trying to convert boolean values into datetime objects, which is not the expected behavior for the test case in the GitHub issue. The function is also failing for the given input, causing a TypeError. The function is returning an incorrect value as new_data, and as a result, the subsequent operations are not functioning as expected.

To fix the bug, the function should only try to convert values to datetime if they are of a suitable type, and in this case, boolean values should not be converted. Additionally, the function should correctly handle boolean values and return them as is, without attempting to convert them to datetime.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    else:
        new_data = data

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if new_data.dtype != "bool":
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
                continue
            return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the dtype is "object" and attempt to convert it to "int64", or else we leave it as is. Then, we check if the data type is numeric and perform the range check. If the data type is not boolean, we proceed to convert it to datetime. If it is a boolean, we simply return the data without attempting to convert it.

This corrected version should resolve the issue in the failing test and provide the expected output of a Pandas Series of boolean values.
