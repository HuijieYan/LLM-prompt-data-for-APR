## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method within the `Parser` class, located in the file `pandas/io/json/_json.py`. The GitHub issue indicates that when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"`, it resulted in the output of a Pandas Series object with datetime values instead of boolean values, which is the expected output. This issue is tied to the bug within the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the `_try_convert_to_date` function include:
1. The check for empty data at the beginning might not properly handle the scenario.
2. The conversion of data to int64 might not be the correct approach for parsing boolean values.
3. The logic for checking if the data is within the range of valid timestamps might not function correctly.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs because the function `_try_convert_to_date` attempts to parse boolean values as integer epoch/ISO formats, resulting in the incorrect conversion of boolean values to datetime values.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, it's essential to handle boolean values separately from date parsing and not coerce them into integer epoch formats. Additionally, the function should correctly recognize boolean data and return a Series of boolean values instead of attempting to parse them as dates.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            # Check if data is boolean, if so, return data as is
            if np.issubdtype(new_data.dtype, np.bool_):
                return new_data, True

            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added a check for boolean data type and return the data as is if it's boolean. This ensures that boolean values are not mistakenly parsed as dates. Additionally, we retain the other logic for handling other data types and date parsing.
