## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is being called during the process of parsing a JSON file using the `pd.read_json()` function. In the GitHub issue, it is mentioned that there is an unexpected behavior where the function `pd.read_json('[true, true, false]', typ="series")` results in a Pandas Series object containing datetime values instead of boolean values.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the `_try_convert_to_date` function are:
1. The conversion of boolean values to datetime within the `for` loop when `to_datetime` is called.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime within the loop, resulting in unexpected behavior.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function should be modified to handle boolean values separately and not attempt to convert them to datetime.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            if all(isinstance(val, (bool, np.bool_)) for val in new_data):
                return new_data, False

            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            if not all(isinstance(val, (bool, np.bool_)) for val in new_data):
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the data contains boolean values, and if it does, we return it as is with a `False` flag to indicate that no conversion was performed. If the data does not contain boolean values, we proceed with the other checks and conversions as before. This ensures that boolean values are not attempted to be converted to datetime, which resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
