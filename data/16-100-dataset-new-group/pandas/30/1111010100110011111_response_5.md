The issue arises from the fact that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is causing a `TypeError`. This is inconsistent with the expected output of a Series of boolean values.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not desired.

To fix the bug, we should update the `_try_convert_to_date` function to only convert values to datetime if they are not already in datetime format. If the data is of type "object", it should be converted to "int64" and then checked for the correct range before attempting to convert to datetime.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if new_data.dtype == 'datetime64':
        return new_data, True
    else:
        return data, False
```

With this corrected version, the function will now only attempt to convert data to datetime if it is not already in datetime format. This will ensure that boolean values will not be incorrectly converted to datetime, resolving the issue.
