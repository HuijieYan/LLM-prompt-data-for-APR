The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function lies in the block of code that is intended to try to convert the input data to a date format and return a boolean indicating whether the conversion was successful. However, several issues exist in the code that prevent it from working correctly.

The first issue is that the function always returns the original `data` if the length of the input `data` is 0, which is incorrect. Instead, it should return an empty array if the length is 0.

Secondly, the variable `new_data` is being overwritten without being checked for dates and no conversion is actually being performed. Additionally, the condition `if new_data.dtype == "object":` is not sufficient for handling different kinds of date formats.

Third, the block of code that attempts to check for out-of-range numbers and return a boolean indicating success is not handling the logic correctly.

The issue in the failing test is that it expects the function to read a JSON input array of booleans and convert it to a Pandas series of booleans, but the `_try_convert_to_date` function is changing the data type and not converting it correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to correctly handle the conversion to a date format and return a boolean value indicating success.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return np.array([], dtype='datetime64[ns]'), False

    new_data = data

    # Attempt to convert object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats
    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='raise', unit='s')
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        pass

    if not isna(new_data).all():
        return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function correctly handles the conversion of the input data to a date format and returns a boolean value indicating the success of the conversion. It also avoids overwriting the `new_data` variable without correctly converting the date formats.
