The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function appears to be related to the way it handles the input data and attempts to convert it to a date column. The function takes in a `data` parameter and tries to parse it into a date column, returning a boolean value indicating if parsing was successful.

Looking at the provided runtime input/output values, we can see that the function is not behaving as expected. In Case 1, the `new_data` variable is assigned the same value as the input data without any conversion. In Case 2, the `new_data` variable also retains the original input data without any conversion.

The main issue seems to be with the logic used to convert the input data to a date column. Specifically, the block of code that checks for the dtype of the data and attempts to convert it to "int64" is not functioning as intended.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic for converting the data to a date column based on its dtype. We can also add additional error handling to ensure that the conversion process is handled properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # Convert numbers to appropriate date format
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit="ns")
    
    # Check for any NaT values after conversion
    if isna(new_data).any():
        return data, False

    return new_data, True
```

In this corrected version, we handle the conversion of the data to a date column using the `pd.to_datetime` function from the pandas library. We also check for any NaT values after conversion to ensure that the process was successful.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
