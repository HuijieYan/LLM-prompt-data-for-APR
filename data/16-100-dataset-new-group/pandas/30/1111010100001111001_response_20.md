The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` is that it is not correctly converting the data to a date format and is not handling the data types properly. It also does not return the expected values. The function is currently not converting the data to date types properly and not handling different types of data.

To fix the bug, we should handle the different data types properly and ensure that the data is converted to the correct date format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs import iNaT
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex, Series, isna, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
        
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if isinstance(data, Series):
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors='coerce')
            return new_data, not new_data.isna().all()
        else:  # for other types of data such as RangeIndex
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors='coerce')
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            return new_data, in_range.all()
```

In the corrected version of the function, I handled different data types properly and ensured that the data is converted to the correct date format using the `to_datetime` function. I also return the converted data along with a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful.
