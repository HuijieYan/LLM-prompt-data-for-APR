## Explanation
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to parse a numpy array into a date column by checking for valid date values. However, the bug occurs when the input data is a boolean array, which is not handled correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` aims to read a JSON array of booleans into a Pandas Series, but it fails due to the buggy behavior of converting the boolean values into timestamps instead of retaining the boolean values.

The expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution are provided to guide the correction of the bug.

The GitHub issue describes exactly this problem, where providing a JSON array of booleans to the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` results in unexpected behavior, specifically converting the boolean values to timestamps. The issue also provides the expected behavior and version information.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the section where the code checks for the dtype of the provided data. When the dtype is an object, the code attempts to coerce it into an int64 dtype, assuming that it might be in epoch/iso formats. However, when the dtype is boolean, this coercion is not handled correctly, leading to the unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle boolean arrays properly. The code attempts to coerce the boolean values into timestamp values, leading to the unexpected conversion of the boolean array into a timestamp array.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function `_try_convert_to_date` needs to be modified to handle boolean arrays correctly. When encountering a boolean array, it should directly return the array as is, as it represents the desired datatype for a Series of booleans.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, True
    
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected version of the function, boolean arrays will be directly returned as is, satisfying the expected behavior described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
