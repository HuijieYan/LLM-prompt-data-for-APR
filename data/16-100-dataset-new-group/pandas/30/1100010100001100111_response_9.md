The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is causing a Pandas Series of boolean values to be incorrectly converted to a Series of timestamps. This issue was reported on GitHub, "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception."

The bug occurs in the function because it incorrectly checks for whether the data is in a numeric format. This leads to the boolean values being interpreted as numeric and getting processed in a way that converts them to timestamps. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior, which should return a Series of boolean values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_try_convert_to_date` function to correctly handle boolean data and return a Series of boolean values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if len(data) == 0:
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:
        return data, False

    return data, True
```

With this corrected function, the boolean values in the input data will no longer be incorrectly processed, and the function will correctly return a Series of boolean values instead of timestamps.
