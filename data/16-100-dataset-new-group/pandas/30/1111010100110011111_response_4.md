1. Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column, coercing objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats. The error message indicates that the function is attempting to convert a boolean value to a datetime, which is not supported. The expected input for the function is the data to be converted, and the expected output is the converted data and a boolean indicating whether the parsing was successful. The GitHub issue confirms that there is an inconsistency in the output, as users would expect a Series of bools, not timestamps or an exception.

2. Potential error locations:
Potential error locations could be in the type conversions and the logic for handling different data types within the function.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the function attempting to convert a boolean value to a datetime, which is not supported, leading to the TypeError. The function is supposed to handle various data types and coerce them into a date format, but it is failing to correctly handle boolean values.

4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by adding a condition to check for boolean values and handle them appropriately within the function, ensuring that only valid data types are being converted to datetime. Additionally, the logic for type conversions may need to be revisited to ensure that it correctly handles different data types.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    # Additional check for boolean type
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By adding an additional check for boolean type and returning False when encountering boolean values, the function will no longer attempt to convert boolean values to a datetime. This should resolve the TypeError and ensure that the function behaves as expected, as outlined in the GitHub issue.
