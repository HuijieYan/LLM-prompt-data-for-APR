Based on the error message and the failing test, it seems that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is incorrectly trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which results in a `TypeError`.

The buggy function contains the following potential error locations:
1. The attempt to convert boolean values to datetime using the `to_datetime` function.
2. The condition to check if `new_data.dtype` is equal to "object" might not be handling boolean values correctly.

The bug is caused by an attempt to convert boolean values to datetime, which is incorrect. The failing test expects the input `[true, true, false]` to result in a Series of boolean values, but the current implementation of `_try_convert_to_date` results in a `TypeError` when attempting to convert boolean values to datetime.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values separately, and return a Series with boolean values rather than trying to convert them to datetime.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    return new_data, True
```

With this corrected version, when the input data contains boolean values, it will simply return the data as is, along with a `False` flag to indicate that no conversion to datetime was performed.

This should resolve the issue and make the function handle boolean values correctly, resulting in the expected output for the failing test.
