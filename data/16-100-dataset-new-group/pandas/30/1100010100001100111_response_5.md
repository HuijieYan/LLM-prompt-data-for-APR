The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` is causing it to incorrectly interpret boolean values as dates, leading to the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

The main issue lies in the coercion of boolean values to integer with the line `new_data = data.astype("int64")`. This is causing the boolean values to be mistakenly interpreted as epoch timestamps, leading to the incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle boolean values and prevent them from being coerced to timestamps.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == 'bool':
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle boolean values and prevent them from being coerced to timestamps, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
