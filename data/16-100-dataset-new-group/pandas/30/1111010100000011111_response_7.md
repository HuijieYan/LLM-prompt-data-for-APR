## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The condition `if not in_range.all():` may not be handling the comparison correctly for all instances of `new_data`.
2. The loop `for date_unit in date_units:` might not be able to handle all the necessary date units and may exit prematurely.
3. The handling of the `TypeError`, `ValueError`, and `OverflowError` exceptions inside the try-except blocks may not be catching the intended errors.

## Explain the cause of the bug

The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` appears to be responsible for incorrectly parsing ndarray like input into a date column. The issue is related to the incorrect handling of date conversion for the input data, resulting in unexpected outputs and exceptions, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The input `data` might be incorrectly converted to `new_data` and checked for being in range, while the loop to handle different date units might not cover all possible units. Additionally, the exception handling seems to be incomplete, leading to the incorrect behavior.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

1. Improve the handling of in-range checks and ensure that all elements of `new_data` are properly evaluated.
2. Refactor the loop to handle different date units to cover all possible cases and ensure that the conversion can be attempted for all units.
3. Modify the exception handling to catch the appropriate errors and handle them accordingly.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # handle empty input
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    success = False
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            success = True  # Mark the conversion as successful
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return new_data, success
```

This corrected version of the function includes improvements in handling in-range checks, refactoring the loop to cover all possible date units, and modifying the exception handling to catch the appropriate errors.
