The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the conversion of data to date format. From the provided runtime input/output values, it can be seen that the function is not correctly identifying whether the input data can be converted to a date or not. In both cases, the new_data variable remains unchanged at the function's return, which indicates that the date conversion process is not working as intended.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to:

1. Check the conditions and logic used to determine whether the data can be converted to a date.
2. Ensure that the date conversion process is correctly applied to the input data.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if data.empty:
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
            
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, the changes include:
- Checking for empty data using `data.empty` instead of `len(data)` to handle Pandas data structures.
- Corrected the assignment of `new_data` to use `new_data.astype` instead of `data.astype`.
- Updated the condition to check if the conversion was successful within the loop and return the result if successful.

These modifications should address the issues observed in the original function.
