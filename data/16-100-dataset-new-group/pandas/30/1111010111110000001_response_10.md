The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is causing a `TypeError` to be raised when trying to convert a boolean value to a datetime object. The bug is likely related to the way the function handles data conversion and parsing.

To resolve the bug, the function needs to be modified so that it can handle boolean values as part of the data conversion process. Specifically, the condition for dtype "object" should be updated to handle boolean values properly and not coerce them to int64, as that is not necessary. Additionally, the date conversion operations should also be updated to handle boolean values.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(data)
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With these changes, the function should now be able to handle boolean values properly and avoid raising a `TypeError` when attempting to convert to datetime. This should resolve the issue with the failing test as well.
