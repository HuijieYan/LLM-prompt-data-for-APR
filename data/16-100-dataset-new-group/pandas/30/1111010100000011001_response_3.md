The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` appears to be attempting to convert input data into a date column. It checks if the input data is empty and then attempts to coerce object data into int64 format. It also ignores numbers that are out of range and then attempts to convert the data into date format using the `to_datetime` function.

There are a few potential error locations within the function:
1. The comparison of `new_data.dtype` with `"object"` might not yield the expected results.
2. The `in_range` variable calculation appears to be comparing `new_data._values` with `iNaT`, which may not achieve the intended logic.
3. The loop over `date_units` and the subsequent `to_datetime` conversion may not produce the correct results.

The cause of the bug could be related to incorrect data type comparisons and the handling of out-of-range numbers. Additionally, the logic within the loop over `date_units` may not be handling date conversion errors correctly.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve checking the data type comparison, ensuring that comparisons with `iNaT` and out-of-range numbers are handled correctly, and revisiting the logic within the loop over `date_units` to ensure proper error handling during date conversion attempts.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype.type == np.object:
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of `new_data.dtype` with `"object"` has been changed to compare the `dtype.type` with `np.object`. The handling of out-of-range numbers and the `iNaT` comparison has been retained. The error handling within the loop over `date_units` has been revisited to ensure proper error handling during date conversion attempts.
