The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect data type conversion and handling when trying to coerce the object into epoch/iso formats and integer/float into epoch formats.
2. The check for numbers that are out of range is not handled properly.
3. Handling of date units and the try-except block for converting to datetime.

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the date conversion and error handling. The function is not correctly coercing the object into epoch/iso formats and integer/float into epoch formats, and there are issues with checking for numbers that are out of range. Additionally, the date units and the try-except block for converting to datetime are not handled properly.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Ensure that the object is correctly coerced into epoch/iso formats and integer/float into epoch formats.
2. Properly handle the check for numbers that are out of range.
3. Handle the date units and the try-except block for converting to datetime properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.apply(lambda x: pd.to_datetime(x))
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range and convert to datetime
    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the date conversion and error handling and pass the failing test.
