The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be related to the conversion of boolean values to date/time format, which is causing unexpected behavior when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"`. The function is incorrectly trying to convert boolean values to date/time format, leading to an inconsistency with the expected output.

The function should be modified to handle boolean values separately and not attempt to convert them to date/time format.

Here's a corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        # if the data type is boolean, return the data as is along with True
        return data, True

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, we have added a condition to handle boolean values separately, where it will return the data as is along with a True value to indicate successful parsing.

This should address the issue with `pd.read_json` returning unexpected results when using `typ="series"` and ensure that the expected output is a Series of boolean values.
