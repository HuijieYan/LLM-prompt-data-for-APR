To fix the bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, one potential error location is the condition for checking the length of the `data` ndarray at the beginning of the function. This can cause issues when trying to convert the data to a date column.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case where the input data is a boolean Series, leading to an incorrect conversion to a date column. This issue was also reported as a GitHub issue titled "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception."

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle boolean Series separately and return the expected output of a Series of boolean values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # Check for boolean Series
    if data.dtype == 'bool':
        return data, False

    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check for boolean Series at the beginning, and if the input data is of type 'bool', it simply returns the input data and False, indicating that no conversion was attempted. This change ensures that the function correctly handles boolean Series and does not attempt to convert them to date columns, thus resolving the bug and satisfying the expected input/output values.
