## Analysis
The issue is related to the `read_json` method when using `typ="series"` and the result being a Pandas Series of timestamps instead of boolean values. The issue occurred in older Pandas versions where a Series of timestamps was returned, and starting from version 1.0.0 it raised a `TypeError`. The bug is likely in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, where it incorrectly converts input data into a date column.

## Error Locations
1. The check for `if new_data.dtype == "object"` and converting to `int64`.
2. The check for numbers that are out of range using `.all()`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function incorrectly converting input data into a date column. This occurs when trying to coerce the object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats, which leads to the unexpected behavior of the returned value being timestamps instead of boolean values.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the conversion logic in the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be revised. We need to ensure that the function only converts the data to date columns when necessary, and when the input data is already in the desired format, it should not attempt any conversion.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors='coerce') # convert the input data into datetime
        if not new_data.isna().all():  # check if all elements are not NaT
            return new_data, True
        else:
            return data, False  # if all elements are NaT, return data as is
    except ValueError:
        return data, False
```

In the fixed version, the input data is directly converted to datetime using `to_datetime` with `errors='coerce'`. Then we check if all elements are not NaT; if so, return the new_data and True. Otherwise, return the original data and False. This ensures that the conversion to datetime only happens as necessary and does not return unexpected results.
