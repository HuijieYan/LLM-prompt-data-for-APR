The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to parse an ndarray into a date column, but it has a bug that causes it to convert boolean values into timestamps, leading to unexpected behavior. This bug is related to an issue on GitHub where calling `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools results in timestamps/Exception instead of a Series of bools.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of boolean values, which should not be converted into timestamps. This is compounded by a failure to check for the specific case of boolean data when attempting to convert to date.

To fix this bug, the `new_data` variable needs to check for the case of boolean data and handle it separately. This will prevent boolean values from being incorrectly converted into timestamps.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore boolean data and do not convert to timestamps
    if new_data.dtype == 'bool':
        return new_data, True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version adds a check for the case of boolean data, allowing it to return the original data with a flag indicating parsing success, preventing boolean values from being converted into timestamps. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
