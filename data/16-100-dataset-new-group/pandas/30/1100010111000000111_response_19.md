The buggy function has a couple of potential error locations. The first issue is with the line `if new_data.dtype == "object":`, where `new_data.dtype` should be compared with `np.object` rather than the string `"object"`. The second issue is with the usage of `date_unit` in the function. The function tries to convert the data to datetime using `to_datetime` with a specific date unit, but the date unit can cause an issue if not handled properly.

The cause of the bug is that when the `read_json` function is called with `typ="series"` and a list of booleans, it tries to convert the list to a Series of datetime objects instead of booleans. The root cause of the issue is the mishandling of object dtype in the original function and the improper handling of date units.

To fix the bug, we will need to address both potential error locations. First, ensure that the comparison for the object dtype is using the correct syntax to prevent unnecessary type conversions. Second, handle the date unit properly to ensure that the data is being converted to the appropriate type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == np.object:  # Ensure correct comparison
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')  # Use pd.to_numeric to handle object dtype
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = [self.date_unit] if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS  # Convert a single date_unit to a list
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)  # Use pd.to_datetime instead of to_datetime
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With the updated function, it should handle the conversion of the list of booleans correctly when `read_json` is called with `typ="series"`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
