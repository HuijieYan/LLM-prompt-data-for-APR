The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date` within the `Parser` class. The function attempts to parse a ndarray into a date column by coercing object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats, and then checking for numbers that are out of range and converting to date using `to_datetime`.

The failing test is the `test_readjson_bool_series` function, which is trying to read a JSON string containing boolean values as a series using `read_json` and expects the output to be a series of boolean values.

The expected input parameter values and types for this failing test are not explicitly provided in the bug report. Instead, the provided issue mentions the behavior observed before and after the bug.

Based on the provided information, the cause of the bug is that the function is coercing boolean values into integer/epoch formats and then attempting to convert them to dates, resulting in output that is inconsistent with the expected behavior. This is due to the incorrect handling of boolean values and the attempt to convert them to dates.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the input data contains boolean values and handle them appropriately, rather than trying to coerce them to integer/epoch formats and converting to dates.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/io/json/_json.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Parser():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return new_data, False

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

With this correction, the function will appropriately handle boolean values and avoid coercing them to integer/epoch formats before converting to dates, ensuring that the expected output will be a series of boolean values.
