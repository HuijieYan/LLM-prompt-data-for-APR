The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is located within the `Parser` class. The function tries to convert the input data into a date column while handling different data types and formats. However, there are some potential error locations within the function that need to be addressed:

1. The function is trying to modify the `new_data` variable, which is a view of the original data array, not a separate copy. This can cause unexpected side effects when modifying the data inside the function.

2. The function does not handle the case where the `new_data` is not of type "object" or a number.

3. The condition for checking in-range numbers is not properly formulated and can lead to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle data types and formats properly, leading to potential conversion errors and incorrect results. To fix the bug, it's important to handle different data types and formats correctly and avoid modifying the input data directly. 

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        # make a copy of the data to avoid modifying the original
        new_data = data.copy()

        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        elif issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) 
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp) 
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue

        return data, False
```

In the corrected version of the function, we make a copy of the input data to avoid modifying the original array. We then handle different data types and formats separately, ensuring that the appropriate conversions are made. We also fixed the in-range condition check. Finally, we handle the errors using the `errors="coerce"` argument in the `to_datetime` function. These modifications should address the potential errors and provide a more robust and correct conversion to a date column.
