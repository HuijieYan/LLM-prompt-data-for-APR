The issue with the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be that it is not handling date parsing correctly for the input values. In the first case, the input data is a `RangeIndex` type, which is then checked for its `dtype`. If the `dtype` is "object", it tries to convert it to "int64". Then, it checks if the values are within a certain range, but the range comparison logic seems to be incorrect. Finally, it tries to convert the data to a date using the `to_datetime` function, but it may not be handling the date parsing correctly.

To fix this, the logic for date parsing needs to be updated. Additionally, the check for the range of the data could be improved.

Here's a corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors='coerce')
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            pass

    # convert to datetime
    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='raise', unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```
In this correction, we use the `pd.to_numeric` method to coerce the object into numeric values. Then, we directly use `pd.to_datetime` to convert the data to datetime, handling the errors with a try-except block.

This corrected version should handle the date parsing logic correctly and fix the failing test case.
