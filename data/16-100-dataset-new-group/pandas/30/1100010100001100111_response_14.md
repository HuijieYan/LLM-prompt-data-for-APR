The issue seems to be related to the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools, which results in timestamps or an exception. The expected output would be a Pandas Series of bools. However, since version 1.0.0, it raises a TypeError instead and does not correctly output a Series of boolean values.

The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` seems to be attempting to convert the input data to a date column, but it is not handling boolean data correctly. This leads to the erroneous behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean data separately and return a Series of boolean values without attempting to convert them to date formats.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # Handling boolean data separately
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This version of the function includes a check for boolean data, where it immediately returns the input data with a False flag to indicate that there was no successful conversion to date. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
