The bug in the function is that it returns the original data and False in all cases, instead of returning the parsed date data and a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful.

The potential error locations are in the conditions for parsing the data and checking if it's in range.

The bug is caused by the function always returning the original data and False, regardless of whether the parsing was successful or not.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly return the parsed date data and a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        else:
            data = new_data

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we appropriately update the `data` variable after the object to integer conversion. Then we return the `new_data` and True if the parsing was successful. Otherwise, we return the original `data` and False.
