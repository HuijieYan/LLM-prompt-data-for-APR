The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` is causing a TypeError when trying to read JSON with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools. The expected output would be a Pandas Series of bools, but it results in a Pandas Series of timestamps or raises a TypeError in older versions of Pandas. This inconsistency with the behavior of `typ="frame"` and the fact that it works correctly with `convert_dates` set to False is the cause of the bug.

The error seems to be occurring due to the function's incorrect handling of boolean values and its attempt to convert them to dates. The `if new_data.dtype == "object"` block is attempting to convert the data to `int64` which is unnecessary and causing the issue.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle boolean data separately and not try to convert it to dates. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data_int = data.astype("int64")
            in_range = (~new_data_int.astype(bool)).all()
            if in_range:
                return new_data, False
            else:
                return new_data_int, False
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function will handle boolean data separately, avoiding unnecessary conversion and ensuring that it returns the expected Pandas Series of bools. It also addresses the causes of the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
