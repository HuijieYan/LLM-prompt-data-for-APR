### Explanation
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column. However, it fails to handle boolean values correctly, resulting in an incorrect conversion to datetime in certain cases, as evidenced by the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series`. The bug arises due to the failure to handle boolean input correctly, ultimately leading to unexpected behavior as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the section of the function where it attempts to convert the input data to datetime in a loop, as this is where the incorrect conversion to datetime seems to occur.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle boolean input correctly and attempts to convert it to date format, leading to unexpected behavior, the creation of a datetime Series instead of a boolean Series, and, in more recent versions of Pandas, a TypeError.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle boolean input and avoid attempting to convert it to a date format, ensuring that it returns a boolean Series as expected. This could involve adding a conditional check to handle boolean data separately before the datetime conversion loop.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        if np.issubdtype(data.dtype, np.bool_):
            return data, True
        else:
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    else:
        new_data = data

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
In the corrected version, a conditional check has been added to handle boolean input explicitly. If the input data's dtype is a boolean, it will return the input data as is, along with a True boolean to indicate the parsing was successful. This will ensure that boolean input is handled correctly and the function returns a boolean Series as expected.
