Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function causes unexpected behavior when trying to parse a Series of boolean values into a date column. This results in either raising a TypeError or incorrectly converting boolean values into timestamps. The cause of this bug is that the function is incorrectly converting boolean Series into timestamps due to a logic error in the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

An appropriate strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the logic that handles the conversion of boolean values to timestamps and ensure that boolean values are appropriately handled and not converted into timestamps.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/io/json/_json.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Parser():


    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a Series-like object into a date column.
        
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if isinstance(data, Series) and data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the provided data is a Series and if its dtype is "bool" without coercing it into int64. If it meets this condition, we simply return the original data and False. If the data is not a bool Series, we attempt to parse it into datetime, and in case of any exceptions, we return the original data and False.

This corrected version ensures that boolean values are not incorrectly converted into timestamps, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
