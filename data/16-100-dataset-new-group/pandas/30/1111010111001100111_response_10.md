The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the `Parser` class in the `pandas/io/json/_json.py` file. It is being called by the `read_json` function with the `typ="series"` parameter in the failing test in `pandas/tests/io/json/test_pandas.py`. The runtime input/output values have been provided for two different cases.

The cause of the bug is that when trying to convert a series of booleans to a date format, the current implementation is incorrectly treating the boolean values as dates and attempting to apply timestamp units to them, leading to unexpected behavior and the raising of a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle the conversion of boolean values to a format that is appropriate for a series of boolean values. This can be achieved by checking the data type of the input and directly converting it to a new series of boolean values without attempting to apply timestamp units.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a series-like object into a date column.
    Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False  # Do not attempt to convert boolean values to date format

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This new implementation specifically checks for boolean values and returns the original data without attempting to convert it to a date format. This new version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` passes successfully.
