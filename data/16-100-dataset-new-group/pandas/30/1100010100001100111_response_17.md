There seems to be a bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function within the `_json.py` file, leading to unexpected outputs in the form of timestamps or exceptions instead of a Series of boolean values when using `typ="series"` in the `read_json` function. The issue appears to be related to the conversion of boolean values to dates.

Analyzing the provided runtime values and the GitHub issue, it's clear that the function fails to handle boolean values correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior when trying to convert them to dates.

The bug seems to be located in the section where the function attempts to coerce object types into integers using `astype("int64")` and then checks if the data is within a specific range. Since boolean values have different coercion behavior and should not be treated as integers, this is likely the cause of the issue.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle boolean values differently from other object types and to ensure that the function correctly returns a Series of boolean values when encountering boolean input.

Here's a corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, True

    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected version, when dealing with boolean data, the function branch will directly return the unmodified data and a boolean indicator of successful parsing. This addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and ensures that using `typ="series"` with boolean inputs results in the expected output of a Pandas Series of boolean values rather than timestamps or exceptions.
