## Analysis:
1. The `_try_convert_to_date` function is responsible for parsing a ndarray into a date column, but it seems to be encountering issues with different data types.
2. The potential error locations within the function include the data type check, handling out of range numbers, and the date parsing logic.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of data types and the date parsing logic, resulting in a failure to convert the input data into a date column.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of different data types, handle out of range numbers effectively, and improve the date parsing logic to successfully convert the input data into a date column.
5. We need to rewrite the `_try_convert_to_date` function to address these issues.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return new_data, False
            
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

In the corrected version of the function:
1. We have removed the loop for different date units, and instead, directly attempt to convert the data using the specified `date_unit`.
2. We have also changed the `errors` parameter in the `to_datetime` function to "coerce" to handle errors by setting the problematic elements to NaT.
3. These changes should address the issues with handling different data types and improve the date parsing logic, resulting in a successful conversion of the input data into a date column.
