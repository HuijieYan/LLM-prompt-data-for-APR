The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be related to the way it handles the conversion of data types to dates. It appears that the function is not correctly converting the input data to the expected date format in all cases.

The potential error locations within the function include:
1. The attempt to convert the data to int64 format, which might not handle the date conversion uniformly for all data types.
2. The comparison and range checks for the data values, which may not be accurate for all scenarios.
3. The iterative attempts to convert the data to datetime using different date units, which may not be exhaustive.

Based on the provided input and expected output, it seems that the function should first convert the input data to int64 format, perform range checks, and then attempt to convert the data to datetime using all available date units.

To fix the bug, the function should consider all necessary checks and expand the error handling for various data types.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        if isinstance(new_data, (np.ndarray, Series)):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
            date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
            for date_unit in date_units:
                try:
                    new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                    return new_data, True
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    continue
        
        return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we have enhanced the handling of different data types and added extensive error handling for conversion to datetime. This should address the issues observed in the failing tests.
