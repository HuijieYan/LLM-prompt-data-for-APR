There are a few issues with the `_try_convert_to_date` function that need to be addressed. The function attempts to convert a given input into a date column and has some issues that need to be resolved to match the expected behavior. 

The first issue is with the `new_data` variable being assigned the same value as `data` initially. This means that the subsequent checks and conversions are performed on the original data, which is not the intended behavior. This results in incorrect handling of the data and can lead to unexpected outcomes.

The second issue is with the handling of boolean values. The function incorrectly treats boolean values as potentially convertible to datetime, leading to errors or incorrect conversions.

To fix these issues, the following adjustments need to be made to the function:
1. Create a copy of the original data to perform the conversions and checks on, to avoid modifying the original data.
2. Explicitly handle boolean values separately and return the Series of boolean values as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()  # Create a copy of the original data

    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False  # Return the original data and False for boolean values

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With these corrections, the function should now handle the conversions and checks as intended and pass the failing test provided. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the unexpected conversion of boolean values and the inconsistent behavior with the "frame" case.
