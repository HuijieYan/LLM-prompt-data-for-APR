The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is caused by the fact that it is trying to convert boolean values to datetime, resulting in a TypeError. This bug is related to the issue "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception" on GitHub.

The cause of the bug is in the `_try_convert_to_date` function's attempt to convert boolean values to datetime. When the function encounters a boolean datatype, it tries to convert it to int64, resulting in the original datatype being retained, and then it attempts to convert it to datetime. This results in a TypeError when the function tries to convert boolean to datetime.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to check for boolean values and handle them appropriately, returning the original data and a False flag to indicate that no conversion to datetime was performed.

Based on the analysis, the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function is provided below:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return data, True
    return data, False
```

With the corrected version of the function, it will now correctly handle boolean values and return the original data and a False flag to indicate that no conversion to datetime was performed. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
