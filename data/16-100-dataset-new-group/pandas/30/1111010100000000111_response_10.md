## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function `_try_convert_to_date` should be returning a Series of bools, however, it is currently returning a boolean if parsing was successful, which is inconsistent with the 'frame' case.
2. The function is attempting to coerce objects into epoch/iso formats and integers/floats into epoch formats, which is not the desired behavior for the given issue.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function incorrectly parsing the input data and returning a boolean instead of a Series of bools, resulting in inconsistent behavior and an undesired output.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to correctly parse the input data as a Series of bools.
2. Remove the unnecessary conversion attempts for different data types and focus solely on parsing the input data to the desired format.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a boolean column.
        """
        
        # parse the input data as a Series of bools
        new_data = Series(data).astype(bool)

        return new_data, True
```
