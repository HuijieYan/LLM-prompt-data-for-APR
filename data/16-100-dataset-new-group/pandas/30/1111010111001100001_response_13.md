The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` is causing it to fail the test `test_readjson_bool_series`. The issue seems to arise from the logic around date conversion and checking for in-range values.

Based on the provided runtime values, it seems that the function is incorrectly treating boolean values as numbers and attempting to convert them to `int64`, which is unnecessary and causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function logic to correctly handle boolean input and avoid unnecessary conversion to `int64`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False  # No need to convert boolean values
        
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

With this corrected function, it is expected to pass the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series`.
