## Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the Parser class and is responsible for trying to parse a numpy array into a date column. The bug seems to be related to the conversion of the input data to datetime and handling of boolean values.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The handling of empty data without considering the type of data.
2. The conversion of object dtype to 'int64' without verifying if the object can be converted to int.
3. A check for numbers out of range but it's unclear if this check is accurately capturing the intended condition.
4. The process of converting data to datetime using the `to_datetime` function could be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the input data types and the conversion process to datetime, resulting in incorrect parsing and returning of the data.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the logic for handling empty data to ensure it doesn't cause issues with subsequent operations.
2. Improve the conversion process of object dtypes to 'int64' by adding proper checks and error handling.
3. Verify the condition for numbers out of range to accurately capture the intended behavior.
4. Revise the conversion to datetime process using the `to_datetime` function to ensure correct parsing.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if isna(data) or len(data) == 0:
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        # check if the object can be converted to int64
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass
    
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False
    
    # Convert to datetime using the specified unit
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```
By addressing the potential error locations and improving the handling of data types and conversion to datetime, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
