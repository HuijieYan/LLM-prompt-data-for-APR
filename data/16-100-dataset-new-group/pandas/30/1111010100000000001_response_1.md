## Analysis:
The _try_convert_to_date function is intended to parse a ndarray into a date column by coercing objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats. It returns a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful. The function seems to be missing proper error handling and does not properly return the result.

## Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The check for an empty data array is done using `if not len(data)`, which may not handle all edge cases correctly.
2. The variable `new_data` is assigned to `data` at the beginning, but it does not handle the data transformation correctly.
3. Error handling using try-except blocks is not comprehensive and might not be catching all potential errors.
4. The logic for checking if numbers are out of range and the subsequent handling may have issues.

## Explanation of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of the data transformation and error handling. The function may not be correctly identifying and converting the date formats, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the array length check is not robust which might lead to unexpected behavior.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Proper error handling for data transformation and date parsing is required.
2. A more robust check for the length of the data array is needed.
3. Ensure that the date conversion logic is correctly implemented to handle different date formats.

    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.

    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return new_data, False
```
Corrected the logic for handling an empty data array. Used `len(data) == 0` instead of `if not len(data)` to more explicitly handle the empty array case. Copied the data array to `new_data` to prevent modifying the original array. Properly handled the numbers that are out of range. Modified the date parsing logic to return the result inside the try block if successful. Added `new_data` to the return statement in the error case outside the for loop.
