The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column by trying to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats. However, it is failing to do so and returning inconsistent and incorrect results.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. The `if new_data.dtype == "object"` block which attempts to convert data to int64, but the result is not appropriately handled.
2. The `if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):` block which checks for numbers out of range, but the handling of the out of range numbers is not consistent with the expected output.

In Case 1, the function is returning the original input `data` without converting it to the expected date column. This indicates that the logic to convert the input data is not functioning as intended.

In Case 2, the function is also returning the original input `data` without converting it to the expected date column. This again highlights that the logic to convert the input data is not working correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for converting the input data into a date column and properly handle out-of-range numbers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column.

    Try to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='ignore')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = ((new_data >= self.min_stamp) & (new_data <= np.iinfo(np.int64).max))
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we use `pd.to_numeric` to convert object data to numeric format. We also use `pd.to_datetime` directly, instead of a loop over date_units, to attempt conversion to a date column for improved consistency and correctness. Additionally, we properly handle out-of-range numbers.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and provide the expected output for the given test cases.
