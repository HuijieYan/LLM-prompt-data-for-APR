The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` is related to the conversion of boolean values to datetime. Due to the implementation of the function, it is trying to parse the boolean values as timestamps, which is not the expected behavior. This causes the function to return a series of timestamps instead of a series of boolean values, resulting in an inconsistency with the expected output.

The initial bug is identified in the `try` block where the function is attempting to convert the data to `int64` dtype. This is unrelated to the expected behavior of the function and may cause unintended conversions.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to modify the function to handle the conversion of boolean values separately and return a series of boolean values accordingly. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check for boolean values and return the data as is in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # handling boolean values separately
    if data.dtype == bool:
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle boolean values and return a series of boolean values instead of trying to convert them to datetime. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
