The issue with the buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is that it is incorrectly trying to convert boolean values to datetime objects, which is not the expected behavior. This is causing a TypeError when trying to convert boolean values to datetime.

To fix this bug, we need to check the data type of the input and if it is boolean, simply return the input data as is, along with a boolean flag indicating successful conversion.

The corrected version of the buggy function is as follows:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
                return new_data, True
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, True
        return data, False
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle boolean values and return them without attempting to convert them to datetime objects. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
