The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is designed to parse an ndarray into a date column. However, it fails to handle certain input values, resulting in a `TypeError` when attempting to convert a boolean value to a datetime.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles boolean values, leading to the TypeError when trying to convert them to datetime. This is evident from the error message specifying that `<class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that boolean values are handled correctly and not passed to the `to_datetime` function, as they are not convertible to datetime. We should also address other potential issues such as the handling of integers and floating-point numbers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.bool_):
        # If it's a boolean array, return the data and mark parsing as unsuccessful
        return data, False
    
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle boolean arrays by returning the original data and marking parsing as unsuccessful. Additionally, we retain the handling of other data types as per the original implementation. This should resolve the TypeError issue when attempting to convert boolean values to datetime.
