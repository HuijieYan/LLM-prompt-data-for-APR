The bug seems to be occurring when the function is trying to parse the input data into a date column. It checks if the data is of type "object" and then tries to convert it into "int64". However, this conversion is unnecessary and can lead to issues. Additionally, the code is also checking for numbers that are out of range, and if so, it returns the original data along with a False value, indicating that parsing was not successful. 

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary conversion to "int64" and also improve the logic for checking numbers that are out of range.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (data <= self.min_stamp) | isna(data) | (data == iNaT)
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue

    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the unnecessary conversion to "int64" and improved the logic for checking numbers that are out of range. We are directly using the input data to check if it's within the range, and if not, returning early with a False value.
