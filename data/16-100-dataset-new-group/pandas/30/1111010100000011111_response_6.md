The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is causing issues with the `pd.read_json` function when `typ="series"` is used and the list contains boolean values. The expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, but it results in a TypeError or a series of timestamps.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the conversion of boolean values to dates. The function attempts to parse the input data into date columns, which is undesired behavior in this context.

To fix this bug, we should update the `_try_convert_to_date` function to check for boolean arrays and return the input data as is, without attempting any date parsing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        return new_data, False
```

With this correction, we are explicitly checking for boolean arrays and returning the input data as is if the dtype is boolean. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post and ensure that the `pd.read_json` function behaves as expected when `typ="series"`.
