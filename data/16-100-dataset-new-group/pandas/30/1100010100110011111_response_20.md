Based on the error message and the expected input/output values, it seems that the issue is related to the function's handling of boolean values when trying to convert them to datetime. The error message specifically states that it is not possible to convert a boolean type to datetime.

The bug is likely located in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, where it attempts to convert the data to a date. Since the input data is a list of booleans, it should not be attempting to convert it to a date.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling boolean input data and is attempting to coerce it into a date. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior and results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we should add a condition to check if the input data is a boolean type, and if so, return the data as is without attempting to convert it to a date.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle boolean input data and return it as is without attempting to convert it to a date. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and pass the failing test.
