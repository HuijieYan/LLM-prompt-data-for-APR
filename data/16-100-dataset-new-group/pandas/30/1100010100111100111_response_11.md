The bug in the provided function is causing a TypeError when trying to convert boolean values to datetime. This issue was reported on GitHub and is related to the `read_json` function failing when trying to parse a JSON list of boolean values into a Pandas Series. The expected output should be a Series of boolean values, but older versions of Pandas were returning a Series of datetime values, while newer versions are raising a TypeError.

The cause of the bug is within the `_try_convert_to_date` function. When the input data contains boolean values, the function incorrectly attempts to convert them to datetime. This results in the TypeError when trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not possible.

To fix this bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to handle the case of boolean values differently, allowing them to be returned as a Series of boolean values without attempting to convert them to datetime.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, a condition is added to handle the case where the input data contains boolean values. If the input data has a dtype of "bool", the function immediately returns the data without attempting to convert it to datetime.

This fix should resolve the TypeError and ensure that the function works correctly when trying to parse a JSON list of boolean values into a Pandas Series.
