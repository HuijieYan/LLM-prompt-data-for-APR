The bug is occurring when the `_try_convert_to_date` function is called in the `pandas/tests/io/json/test_pandas.py` file. The error message indicates that a class of `bool` is not convertible to datetime, which is unexpected as the input is expected to be a series of bools. This is happening when the `to_datetime` function is called within the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of boolean values in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, which is leading to the attempt to convert boolean values to datetime, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values appropriately and return the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _try_convert_to_date function
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. 
    Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    # Handle boolean values
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version of the function, we added a conditional to check for boolean values. If the data has a dtype of `bool`, we simply return the data and `False`, which indicates that the parsing was not successful. This fix will prevent the Boolean values from being incorrectly processed by the `to_datetime` function, and the TypeError will be resolved.

With this correction, the function should now handle the input correctly and return the expected output, thereby addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
