Based on the GitHub issue and the provided buggy function, the problem described is that when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools, it results in a Pandas Series object with datetime values instead of boolean values. This behavior is inconsistent with the "frame" case and is not what users would expect.

One potential error location within the buggy function is the `to_datetime` function call, which tries to convert the data to datetime. This is likely the cause of the bug, as it results in the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `to_datetime` function call should be removed from the `_try_convert_to_date` function for the case when the input data is of type "bool". Additionally, the function should correctly return a Pandas Series of boolean values in this case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    else:
        new_data = data

    return new_data, isinstance(new_data[0], np.datetime64)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the input data has a dtype of "object" and try to convert it to "int64". If that fails, we retain the original data. Then, we return the new_data and a boolean indicating whether the first element of new_data is of type np.datetime64.

This change ensures that the function no longer tries to convert the data to datetime, and it correctly returns a Pandas Series of boolean values.

This fix aligns with the expected behavior in the GitHub issue and ensures that `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools results in a Pandas Series object with boolean values.
