## Analysis
The function `_try_convert_to_date` is meant to convert data into a date column and return a boolean indicating if the conversion was successful. It checks if the data is empty, tries to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats, and then converts the data to datetime. There are a few potential error locations within the function, such as the handling of empty data, dtype checking, and the conversion to datetime.

The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is trying to read a JSON string into a Series and then assert that the result matches the expected Series. The failing test indicates that the function is not handling the input data correctly, leading to an incorrect conversion.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the input data and the conversion process within the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check for empty data and handle it appropriately.
2. Ensure that the dtype checking and conversion to int64 is done correctly for object types.
3. Verify the logic for checking if the numbers are in range or not.
4. Update the date conversion process to ensure it handles the input data properly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if len(data) == 0:  # check for empty data
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")  # corrected dtype conversion
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With the updated corrections in place, the `_try_convert_to_date` function should now correctly handle the input data and perform the necessary conversions, allowing it to pass the failing test.
