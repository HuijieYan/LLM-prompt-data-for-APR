The cause of the bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that the date parsing logic is not handling the data correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the date parsing process for numeric values and non-numeric values. Additionally, the function does not handle the RangeIndex and Series types of the `data` input properly, leading to the incorrect return of the original `data` in some cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the different data types and address the incorrect parsing of date units.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if isinstance(new_data, Series) and new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if isinstance(new_data, Series) and issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            if isinstance(new_data, Series):
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data._values, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            else:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected function, we have added checks to properly handle Series objects and their data types, and fixed the date parsing process to use `to_datetime` for Series and ndarrays separately as needed. Additionally, we have addressed the incorrect handling of RangeIndex and Series types by using `isinstance` checks to handle different types of data appropriately.
