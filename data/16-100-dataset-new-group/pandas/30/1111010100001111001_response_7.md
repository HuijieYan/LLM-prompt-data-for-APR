The bug appears to be in the logic which tries to convert the data into a date column. In the provided sample cases, the function appears to be incorrectly identifying data as not in range when it actually is.

The potential error locations within the function are as follows:
1. The code that checks if the new_data is in range is not working as expected.
2. The code that tries to convert new_data to int64 may not be handling the data types correctly.

The cause of the bug is, most likely, a combination of incorrect logic in checking for in-range data and incorrect handling of data types during the conversion process.

To fix the bug, the in-range check should be reviewed to ensure that it accurately identifies when data is within the specified range. Additionally, the logic for converting new_data to int64 should be validated to handle different data types appropriately.

Here is the fixed version of the buggy function:

```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.copy().astype('i8')
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data >= self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
