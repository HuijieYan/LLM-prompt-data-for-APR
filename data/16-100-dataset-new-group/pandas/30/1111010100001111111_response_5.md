The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is causing issues with parsing a series of booleans into a date column, resulting in inconsistent behavior and an error. The bug is likely located in the section where the function tries to convert the series to `int64` dtype.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is attempting to coerce the series to `int64` dtype, which is unnecessary for a series of boolean values. This unnecessary coercion then leads to errors when trying to convert the values to datetime.

Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data type of the input series and only attempt to coerce it to `int64` if it's necessary (i.e., if it's of object type).
2. If the data type is boolean, skip the coercion step and directly proceed to converting the values to datetime using `to_datetime`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a series-like input into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.
    Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """

    # no conversion on empty
    if data.empty:
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    else:
        new_data = data

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected version checks the data type of the input series and decides whether to coerce it to `int64` based on its type. If the dtype is "object", it attempts the coercion, otherwise, it directly proceeds to converting the values to datetime using `to_datetime`.
