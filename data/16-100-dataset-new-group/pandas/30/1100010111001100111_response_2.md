## Correction

The issue seems to be related to the "try_convert_to_date" function trying to parse boolean values as date columns. This is resulting in the incorrect output of a Series of timestamps instead of a Series of boolean values. 

To fix this bug, the "try_convert_to_date" function needs to be modified to correctly handle boolean values without attempting to parse them as date columns. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:
        if new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
}
```

In this corrected version, a condition is added to check if the data type is boolean. If the data is of type "bool," it is returned as is, without attempting to parse it as a date column. This should resolve the issue and the failing test related to reading JSON with "typ=series" of boolean values.
