### Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is responsible for converting input data to a date column, but it appears to be converting boolean values to timestamps instead of retaining their boolean nature. This is evident from the GitHub issue which reports that the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools is resulting in timestamps or an exception instead of a Series of bools.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `isna` function might not be handling boolean values correctly, resulting in the conversion to timestamps instead of retaining as boolean values.
2. The `to_datetime` function might not be handling boolean values correctly, leading to the conversion to timestamps.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempting to convert boolean values into timestamps, resulting in an unexpected output when the expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to handle boolean input separately and ensure that boolean values are retained as such in the output and not converted to timestamps. This might involve updating the logic for handling different data types, especially handling boolean values separately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore boolean type and pass it through
    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version includes a specific check for boolean data types and returns them as such without attempting to convert them to timestamps, thereby addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
