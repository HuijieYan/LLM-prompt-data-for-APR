The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` is causing a TypeError when trying to parse a list of bool values as a Pandas Series. It is incorrectly converting the bool values into timestamps instead of returning a Series of bool values. This is inconsistent with the behavior when `typ="frame"` is used and when `convert_dates` is set to False.

The bug likely exists in the section of the function where it tries to coerce the data into integer format, as it does not handle bool values correctly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to explicitly handle bool values and return a Pandas Series of bools when the input is a list of bool values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if issubclass(data.dtype.type, bool):
            return data, False

        try:
            date_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
            return date_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

This correction checks if the input data is of bool type, and if so, it returns the data as-is, indicating parsing was unsuccessful as a date. Otherwise, it attempts to convert the data to datetime, and if successful, it returns the datetime data. If not successful, it returns the original data.
