The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be related to the way the date conversion is handled. It appears that the function is not correctly identifying and parsing dates, particularly when the data type is an object. The function is also not effectively handling the checking for numbers that are out of range.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to ensure that it correctly identifies and parses dates across different data types. Additionally, we need to ensure that the check for numbers that are out of range is more robust.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors='coerce')
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data >= self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    return new_data, True
```

In this corrected version, we use the `to_datetime` function directly with the `errors='coerce'` parameter to handle date parsing for objects. Additionally, we modify the check for numbers that are out of range to include those that are equal to the minimum stamp, and we use the `>=` operator for comparison.

These changes should address the issues with date parsing and range checking in the original function.
