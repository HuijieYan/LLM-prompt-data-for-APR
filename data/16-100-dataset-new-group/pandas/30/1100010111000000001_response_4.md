The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is trying to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column. The function checks the data type of the input and then tries to convert it to a date using the `to_datetime` function. However, there are several potential error locations within the function:

1. The check for an empty input array `if not len(data)` is not correct as it returns the original input data and `False`, which is not the expected behavior.
2. The conversion of object type to "int64" may not be appropriate for date parsing.
3. The comparison with `self.min_stamp`, `iNaT` and the date unit may not be correct.

The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is trying to read a JSON array of boolean values and convert it into a Pandas Series. The failing is likely due to the `_try_convert_to_date` function's inappropriate type conversion and comparison logic.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to rewrite the `_try_convert_to_date` function, removing unnecessary type conversions and comparisons, and using the correct method for parsing date values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

  try:
      new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
      return new_data, True
  except (ValueError, OverflowError):
      return data, False
```

This version of the function directly uses the `to_datetime` function to parse the input data into a date column, and handles any errors that may occur during the parsing.
