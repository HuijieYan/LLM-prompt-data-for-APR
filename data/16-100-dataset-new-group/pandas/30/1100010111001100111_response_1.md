The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` is causing the `read_json` function to return a Series of timestamps instead of boolean values when `typ="series"` is specified. This is inconsistent with the behavior when `typ="frame"` is used and is resulting in unexpected behavior for the users.

The issue is caused by the function trying to convert boolean values into dates, which is unnecessary and causing the unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean input correctly and return a Series of boolean values when appropriate.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            if (new_data == 0) | (new_data == 1):
                return new_data.astype(bool), True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return data, False
```

This corrected version checks if the input data is of dtype "object" and tries to convert it to `int64`. Then it checks if the resulting data contains only 0s and 1s, which indicates that it was originally boolean data. If so, it returns the boolean data and a `True` flag indicating successful conversion. Otherwise, it returns the original data and `False`.

With this correction, the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` should now return a Series of boolean values as expected. This will resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
