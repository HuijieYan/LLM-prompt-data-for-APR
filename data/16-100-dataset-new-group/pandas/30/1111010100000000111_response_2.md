## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is called within the `Parser` class and is related to the `read_json` function in Pandas. This buggy function is responsible for converting data to date columns, but it is causing issues when parsing boolean values from JSON input, as described in the GitHub issue.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the `_try_convert_to_date` function include the handling of boolean values when attempting to convert them to a date format. The function is currently trying to coerce boolean values into date formats, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the GitHub Issue information
The cause of the bug is that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is attempting to convert boolean values, which are not convertible to datetime, into date formats. This causes inconsistencies and unexpected behavior, as described in the GitHub issue.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
The strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values separately and avoid attempting to convert them into date formats. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check to bypass the date conversion for boolean values.

## Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version
```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                new_data = data
        else:
            new_data = data
    
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            if new_data.dtype != bool:  # Avoid converting boolean values
                try:
                    new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    continue
                return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function, a conditional check has been added to avoid converting boolean values to datetime formats. This addresses the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensures that boolean values are handled separately from date conversions.
