## Analysis
The `_try_convert_to_date` function is intended to convert data to a date column, handling conversions of different data types and formats. However, the function seems to be incorrectly identifying the data type and is therefore not correctly handling the conversion to a date column. This is causing incorrect responses when attempting to convert the data to dates, as seen in the provided runtime values and types of variables.

## Error Locations
1. The check `if new_data.dtype == "object":` might be incorrectly identifying the data type, leading to unexpected behavior in the conversion process.
2. The process for handling numbers that are out of range might not be accurate, leading to an incorrect selection of data.
3. The loop over date units might not be correctly applying the conversion, leading to a failure to convert the data to dates.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect identification of data types, inaccurate handling of numbers that are out of range, and a failure to correctly apply the conversion to different date units. This results in an incorrect response when attempting to convert data to date columns, causing the issues reported in the GitHub post.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should be adjusted to correctly identify the data type and handle conversions to date columns accurately. This might involve revisiting the logic for handling different data types, ensuring that out-of-range numbers are correctly processed, and accurately applying the conversion to different date units.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if isinstance(data, (Series, DataFrame)):
        new_data = data.values
    else:
        new_data = data

    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
            if new_data.isnull().any():
                continue
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```
In the corrected version, we first check if the input `data` is a Pandas Series or DataFrame and extract the underlying values if it is. Then, we proceed to apply the necessary conversions while handling the data type, out-of-range numbers, and date unit conversions more accurately. This corrected version should address the issues reported in the GitHub post.
