### Bug Analysis
The `Parser` class contains the `_try_convert_to_date` method, which is intended to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column. The method first checks if the input is empty and returns it unchanged if it is. Then it attempts to coerce object types into `int64` and checks for numbers that are out of range. After that, it tries to convert the input to a datetime format using different unit options. 

The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is designed to read a JSON array of boolean values and parse it into a Pandas Series. However, the method returns incorrect results, casting the boolean values into datetime objects instead of preserving them as bools.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the section where it tries to coerce object types into `int64`. This is unnecessary for boolean values and may lead to unintended conversions.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the method attempts to convert the input data (consisting of boolean values) into `int64` unnecessarily before checking for numbers that are out of range. This preprocessing step leads to the unintended conversion of boolean values into `int64` before attempting to parse them into datetime objects, resulting in the incorrect output of datetime objects instead of bools.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the method should first check for numbers that are out of range without unnecessary type coercion. For boolean values, the method should directly proceed to parsing them into datetime objects without attempting any type conversions. 

### Corrected Code
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version first checks for out-of-range numbers and skips unnecessary type coercion. Then, it directly attempts to parse the input data into datetime objects without converting boolean values into `int64`. This should resolve the issue and make the method return the expected Pandas Series of boolean values.
