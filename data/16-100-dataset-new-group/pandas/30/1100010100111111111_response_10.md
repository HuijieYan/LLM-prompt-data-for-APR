## Plan for Fixing the Bug
1. The error message indicates that the function is trying to convert a boolean class to a datetime, which is not possible. The bug is occurring when trying to convert a Series of boolean values into a datetime format.
2. The bug is likely within the `_try_convert_to_date` function, specifically in the section where it attempts to convert the input data to a datetime format.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling boolean values correctly, attempting to convert them to dates and raising a TypeError. This causes the failing test to raise an exception. The expected output should be a Pandas Series of boolean values, but the current implementation is converting boolean values to dates, leading to inconsistent behavior with the "frame" case and raising an exception.
4. To fix the bug, the function should first check if the input data is of boolean type, and if so, simply return it as is without any further conversion. Additionally, the function should handle other data types for consistent behavior.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the function below that handles boolean values correctly and ensures the expected behavior for all data types.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if isinstance(data, Series) and data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False  # Return the data as is if it's a Series of boolean values

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By implementing these changes, the function should now correctly handle Series of boolean values and avoid attempting to convert them to datetime, resolving the bug and ensuring consistent behavior.
