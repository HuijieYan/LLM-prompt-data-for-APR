The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is designed to convert input data into a date format. However, in the provided cases, it fails to do so. The error message indicates that the data is of type 'bool' and is not convertible to datetime. This indicates that the function is unable to handle boolean data types and does not account for this case.

Potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The check for data type (bool) and coercion to int64.
2. Handling of boolean values during datetime conversion.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle boolean data type correctly. It tries to coerce boolean values to int64, which results in the error when trying to convert them to datetime.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle boolean values separately and ensure they are not coerced to int64. We should also ensure that boolean values are processed correctly during datetime conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to handle boolean values separately. If the data type is 'bool', we return the original data with a parsing result of False, indicating that the parsing was not successful for boolean values. This ensures that boolean values are not coerced to int64 and are processed correctly during datetime conversion.
