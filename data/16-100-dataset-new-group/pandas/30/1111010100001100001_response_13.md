The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be related to the handling of date conversion and checking if the values are in range. The function is intended to convert data into a date column and return a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the date conversion process using `to_datetime` and the check for numbers that are out of range. 

In Case 1, when the input data is a `RangeIndex` and `dtype` is being converted to `int64`, the `in_range` array is being populated with all `False` values, which indicates that the condition `if not in_range.all()` is not being met. This implies that the range check for the numbers is not working as intended.

In Case 2, the input data is a `Series` of boolean values, and the date conversion process for different time units is being attempted. This seems unnecessary and can potentially cause issues.

To fix the bug, we can modify the range check condition and remove unnecessary date conversion attempts for boolean type data. It seems that the function is assuming the input data to be of numeric type and trying to convert it, which is unnecessary and results in incorrect behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if isna(data).all():
        return data, False

    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        in_range = (data > self.min_stamp)
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False

    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, I removed the unnecessary date units iteration and simplified the range check condition. I also added a check for all values being NaN to return False. These changes should address the issues observed and provide a more reliable date conversion process.
