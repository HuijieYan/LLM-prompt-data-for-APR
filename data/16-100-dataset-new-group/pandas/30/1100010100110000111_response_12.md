## Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert a given input into a date column. The error message suggests that the function is encountering a `TypeError` when attempting to convert a boolean to a datetime object.

The GitHub issue explains that this is problematic because the expected output should be a Series of bools, not a Series of timestamps or an exception. Additionally, the behavior is inconsistent with the case when `typ="frame"`.

## Error Locations
1. The line `new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)` is likely causing the error.
2. The block of code that processes `new_data` as an object type and attempts to convert it to `int64` may also be a potential error location.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempting to convert a boolean to a datetime object. This is happening due to the input being inferred as an object type and processed accordingly, ultimately leading to the attempt to convert the boolean to a datetime object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_try_convert_to_date` function does not attempt to convert booleans to datetime objects. Additionally, we need to consider the requirements for `typ="series"` and provide the expected behavior as outlined in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == bool:
        return data, True

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(data._values)
                | (data > self.min_stamp)
                | (data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return data, True

    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the data is of type boolean and return it with a successful conversion flag. If it's not a boolean, we proceed with the existing logic for converting the data to datetime, ensuring to handle the `object` type and ignore numbers that are out of range. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and prevent attempted conversion of booleans to datetime objects.
