The cause of the bug is that the `try_convert_to_date` function is not correctly handling the input data to properly convert it into a date column. It makes an incorrect assumption that the input data is in the "object" dtype, and tries to convert it to "int64" dtype without validating the input data format.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle the input data and perform the date conversion. Specifically, we need to check the data type of the input, validate its format, and then convert it to a date column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    
    # Check if data is already in int64 format
    if new_data.dtype == "int64":
        # Nothing to do, the data is already in the correct format
        return new_data, True

    # Check if data is in object format and try to convert to integer
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        else:
            return new_data, True

    # If the data format is still not int64, return False
    return new_data, False
```

The corrected version of the function handles different cases of input data types and appropriately converts them to the correct format. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
