The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is causing the `TypeError: <class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime` error. This bug is causing the function to try to convert boolean values to datetime, which is incorrect.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The check for empty data seems unnecessary and may cause issues.
2. Converting data to int64 dtype for object types may cause unexpected behavior.
3. The comparison with `self.min_stamp` and `iNaT` may not be necessary.

The bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, even though the expected return type is a boolean Series.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Remove the unnecessary check for empty data.
2. Avoid converting data to int64 dtype for object types.
3. Remove the comparison with `self.min_stamp` and `iNaT` as it is not necessary for a boolean Series input.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors='ignore')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    else:
        new_data = data

    return new_data, isinstance(new_data, Series) and new_data.dtype.name.startswith('datetime')
```

This corrected function avoids unnecessary type conversions and comparisons and correctly handles the input. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case with a JSON list of boolean values.
