The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be that the check for whether `new_data` contains valid date values is not working correctly. The function is trying to identify if the items in the `new_data` array are valid date values and return a boolean if parsing was successful, but it is not handling different data types and formats properly.

The strategy for fixing this bug would be to first check if the input `data` is in a valid date format, and if not, attempt to convert it to a valid date format. Additionally, there is a problem with the check for numbers that are out of range, as it seems to compare values with `self.min_stamp` and `iNaT`, but it's not correctly filtering out the invalid numbers.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if hasattr(data, 'dtype'):
        if data.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]':
            return data, True

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            (new_data >= self.min_stamp)
            & (isna(new_data) | (new_data._values != iNaT))
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    return new_data, True
```

In this version, we check if the input `data` is already in the valid date format 'datetime64[ns]', and if so, we return it with a boolean of `True`. If the data is of object type, we use `to_datetime` to try to explicitly convert it to a valid date format. Additionally, we fix the check for numbers that are out of range by properly filtering valid values based on the `self.min_stamp` and `iNaT` values.
