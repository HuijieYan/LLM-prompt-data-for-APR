The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function lies in the logic for checking and converting the input data to dates. The function incorrectly converts boolean data to int and tries to ignore numbers out of range without considering the fact that it is handling boolean data.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle boolean data correctly and remove the unnecessary conversion of boolean data to int. We should also modify the logic to handle boolean data directly without the need for checking the range.

Here's a corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="coerce")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="coerce")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return new_data, True
```

This corrected version handles boolean data correctly by directly converting it to a datetime and it follows the same logic for other data types as well. With this fix, the test function `test_readjson_bool_series` should pass successfully.
