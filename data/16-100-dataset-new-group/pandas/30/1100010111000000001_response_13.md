## Analysis
The `_try_convert_to_date` function is designed to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column and return a boolean if parsing was successful. The function checks for empty input, tries to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats, and ignores numbers that are out of range. It then attempts to convert the data to datetime using different date units.

## Identified Potential Error
The potential error could be in the handling of different data types and the conversion to datetime.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of different data types and the datetime conversion, leading to the function failing the test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles different data types correctly, performs the conversion to datetime accurately, and returns the correct boolean value indicating the success of parsing.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="coerce")
        success = not new_data.isnull().any()
        return new_data, success
    except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
        return data, False
```

In the corrected version of the function, the input data is directly passed to `pd.to_datetime` with the `errors="coerce"` parameter to handle different data types. We then check if any null values exist in the new_data and use that as a measure of success. If any exceptions are caught during the conversion, the original data and a False boolean are returned.
