The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert a Series of boolean values into datetime values, resulting in a `TypeError` because a boolean class is not convertible to datetime. This is the cause of the bug and is consistent with the GitHub issue, where the user expects a Series of boolean values but instead receives an exception or a series of timestamps.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle only boolean values and return a Series of boolean values. If the input data is of dtype 'object', it should be checked for boolean values and converted if necessary. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a Series into a date column. Handle only boolean values.

    Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        # check for boolean values
        if all(isinstance(x, bool) for x in new_data):
            return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

This modified version of the function checks if the input data is of dtype 'object' and contains only boolean values. If that's the case, it returns the original input data and a boolean indicating successful parsing. Otherwise, it returns the original input data and False.

This fix addresses the bug and fulfills the expected behavior of returning a Series of boolean values.

By implementing this fix, the function should now correctly handle the input and return the expected Series of boolean values. This will resolve the issue reported in GitHub regarding the unexpected conversion of boolean values to datetime.
