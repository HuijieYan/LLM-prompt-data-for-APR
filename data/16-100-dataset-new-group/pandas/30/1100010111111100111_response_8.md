The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is causing a TypeError when trying to convert boolean values to datetime. The function first checks if the input data is empty and returns the data and False if it is. Then it attempts to convert the data to int64 dtype if it is of object type, and then checks for numbers that are out of range. Finally, it tries to convert the data to datetime using different units, and if successful, it returns the new data and True.

The bug occurs when trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which results in a TypeError. This is evident from the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` where the input data `[true, true, false]` is expected to be converted to a Series of boolean values but is instead resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle boolean values differently in the `_try_convert_to_date` function and ensure that they are not treated as convertible to datetime. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore booleans and numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, (np.number, np.bool_)):
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this correction, the function checks for boolean values and returns them as False immediately, avoiding the attempt to convert them to datetime. This should resolve the TypeError occurring with boolean values and ensure that the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` passes successfully.
