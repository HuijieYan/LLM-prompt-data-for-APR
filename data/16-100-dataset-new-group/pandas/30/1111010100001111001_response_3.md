The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function occurs because the code does not properly handle the conversion of various data types to date. In Case 1, the function incorrectly assumes that the data is of type "object" and tries to convert it to int64 without considering that it is already an integer. In Case 2, the function fails to correctly detect the data type and convert it to datetime.

To fix the bug, the function should first check the data type and then handle the conversion accordingly. If the data is already a supported type, it should proceed with the conversion, otherwise, it should return False.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors='coerce')
            return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False
    
    return data, False
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the input data is empty and returns immediately if it is. Then, it checks if the data type is "object" and attempts to convert it using `pd.to_datetime`. If the conversion is successful, it returns the new data and True. If the data is already of a supported type, it proceeds with the in_range check and returns the result accordingly.
