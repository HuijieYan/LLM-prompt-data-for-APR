The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` attempts to parse a numpy array-like input into a date column. It tries to handle various data types and formats, but there are some potential error locations within it.

The potential error locations are:
1. Incorrect handling of the `new_data` assignment, which could mutate the original data when it should be left unchanged.
2. The check for the length of the data is not properly handling the empty data case, and the return statement might not be consistent with the expected behavior.
3. The checks for integer and float types may not handle all edge cases or may not coerce the data as intended.
4. The logic for handling numbers that are out of range may be incorrect and could result in unexpected behavior.
5. The date parsing loop may not always return the expected result due to the way it is structured.

The cause of the bug is likely related to these potential error locations, including incorrect data mutation, improper handling of empty data, and incorrect coercing of data types.

To fix the bug, a strategy would involve:
1. Use a copy of the original data to prevent unintended mutation.
2. Properly handle the case of empty data.
3. Ensure that the checks for integer and float types handle all edge cases and coerce the data correctly.
4. Revise the logic for handling numbers that are out of range to ensure that it is consistent and accurate.
5. Adjust the date parsing loop to guarantee that it returns the expected result.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if len(data) == 0:  # handle empty data
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()  # use a copy of the original data

    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')  # coercing data types correctly
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if np.issubdtype(new_data.dtype, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)  # using 'coerce' for errors
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError):
            continue
    return data, False
