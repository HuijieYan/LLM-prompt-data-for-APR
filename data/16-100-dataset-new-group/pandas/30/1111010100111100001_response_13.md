The bug appears to be related to the data type conversion and the subsequent attempt to convert boolean values to datetime.

The function `_try_convert_to_date` is supposed to try and parse a ndarray-like input into a date column. It first checks if the input is empty, in which case it should return the empty data and a boolean False. Then, it attempts to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. If the input is a subclass of a numpy number, it should ignore numbers that are out of range. Finally, it tries to convert the input to datetime using different units and returns the converted data and a boolean indicating whether the parsing was successful or not.

The cause of the issue seems to be that when the input data is of type boolean, the function incorrectly attempts to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not possible and causes a TypeError.

To fix this issue, we need to handle boolean values separately and return the input data unchanged with a False flag, indicating that no conversion to datetime was possible.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif data.dtype == "bool":
        # Handle boolean values separately
        return data, False
    else:
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(data._values)
                | (data > self.min_stamp)
                | (data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, when the input data is of type boolean, we return the input data unchanged with a False flag, indicating that no conversion to datetime was possible.
