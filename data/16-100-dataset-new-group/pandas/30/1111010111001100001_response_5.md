The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the date conversion logic. The function is trying to convert the input data into a date format, but the logic is flawed.

In the first case, the input `data` is a `RangeIndex`, which is correctly being converted to `int64` dtype by the code. However, the subsequent logic regarding date units and conversion to datetime seems to be incorrect.

In the second case, the input `data` is a `Series` of boolean values. The dtype of the `new_data` seems to be correct (`dtype('bool')`), and the `date_units` are also being extracted correctly, but the logic for converting to datetime seems to be flawed.

To fix the bug, the logic for date conversion needs to be revised to ensure that it accurately converts the input data to datetime, respecting the data types and units. Specifically, the loop over `date_units` and the subsequent conversion using `to_datetime` needs to be reviewed to ensure it handles the input data correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    # Try to convert the data to datetime
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

In this corrected version, the date conversion is simplified to only use `to_datetime` without the need for a loop over `date_units`. This should fix the bug and make the function work as expected.

This corrected version should pass the failing test for the `read_json_bool_series` function.
