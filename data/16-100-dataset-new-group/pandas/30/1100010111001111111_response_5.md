## Fixing the bug

After analyzing the provided information, it appears that the issue lies within the `_try_convert_to_date` function. The function is erroneously attempting to convert boolean values into dates, resulting in incorrect behavior. To resolve this, we need to modify the function to correctly handle boolean values and return them as a Series of booleans.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Check the data type of the input `data` and handle boolean values separately from other data types.
2. Convert boolean values to the correct data type (e.g., int or bool) if necessary, and return the Series of booleans appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        # No date conversion for boolean values, return the original data as a Series
        return data, True
    else:
        # Since it's not a boolean, attempt date conversion
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            # If date conversion failed, return data as is
            return data, False
```

By making the above changes, the `_try_convert_to_date` function will properly handle boolean values and return a Series of booleans without attempting to convert them into dates. This corrected version should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the failing test.
