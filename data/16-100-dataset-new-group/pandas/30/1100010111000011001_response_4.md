The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is causing it to not correctly parse the input data into a date column. The function is trying to coerce the input data into an integer type and then check if the values are within a certain range before converting to a date. However, the logic in the current code is flawed and is not correctly handling the input data.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly coercing the input data into an integer type, and not handling the date parsing correctly. This leads to the function returning the original input data without converting it to dates.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the conversion of the input data to date units using the `to_datetime` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="coerce")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return new_data, not new_data.isnull().all()
```

In the corrected version, we use the `pd.to_datetime` function to directly convert the input data to datetime values. We also return a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful.

With this correction, the function should now correctly parse the input data into a date column and pass the failing test.
