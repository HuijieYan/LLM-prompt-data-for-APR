The bug in the provided function is causing an error when trying to parse a boolean Series as a date column. The issue on GitHub confirms that the expected output should be a Series of bools, but the function is currently trying to convert the data to a datetime format, causing a TypeError.

The bug is likely occurring at the following line in the function:
```python
new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
```
This line is responsible for converting the data to a datetime format, which is unnecessary for boolean data and causing the error.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the data is boolean, and if so, return it as is without trying to convert it to a datetime format. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:
        return data, False  # return data as is if it's not an object type

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    return data, False  # return data as is
```

This corrected version handles the boolean data correctly and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
