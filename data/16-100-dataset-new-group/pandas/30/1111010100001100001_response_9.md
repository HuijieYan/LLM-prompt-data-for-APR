The issue with the current implementation of the _try_convert_to_date function is that the logic for converting data to date is not handling the different data types properly, leading to incorrect outputs. It also seems to be assuming that the input data is in a specific format, such as an ndarray, which is not necessarily the case.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to handle different data types more robustly, and to ensure that the date conversion logic is applied correctly for each type.

Here's a corrected version of the _try_convert_to_date function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a data structure into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if data.empty:
            return data, False
    
        if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
            new_data = data
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors='coerce')
                return new_data, True
            except:
                return data, False
        else:
            try:
                new_data = pd.Series(pd.to_datetime(data, errors='coerce'))
                return new_data, True
            except:
                return data, False
```

In this corrected version:
- We check if the input data is empty using the `empty` attribute instead of `len(data)`.
- We use `pd.to_datetime` to convert the input data into datetime objects, handling different data types (like Series or other data structures) more robustly.
- We catch any potential errors that may occur during the conversion and return `False` if the conversion is not successful.

This corrected version should more effectively handle different types of input data and properly convert them to date format.
