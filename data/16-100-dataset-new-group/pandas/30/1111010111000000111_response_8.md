## Strategy for fixing the bug
Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the _try_convert_to_date function in the Parser class is mistakenly converting boolean values to timestamps. The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of boolean values in the _try_convert_to_date function, which results in the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _try_convert_to_date function to correctly handle boolean values and ensure that it returns a Series of boolean values instead of timestamps.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the _try_convert_to_date function
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        if data.dtype == "object":
            if data.apply(lambda x: isinstance(x, bool)).all():
                return data.astype(bool), True
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                if new_data.dtype == "datetime64[ns]":
                    return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

The corrected version of the _try_convert_to_date function now correctly handles boolean values by checking if all the elements in the input data are boolean. If they are, it converts the data to boolean type and returns it along with a boolean indicating successful parsing. If the data contains other types or is not successfully parsed as a date, it returns the original data and a False boolean.

With this correction, the function should now return a Series of boolean values as expected and pass the failing test related to reading JSON data with typ="series". This fix resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
