## Issue Analysis
The issue on GitHub indicates that when using the `read_json` method with `typ="series"` and a JSON list of booleans, the result is not as expected. Instead of getting a Pandas Series of booleans, it returns a Pandas Series of timestamps in older versions of Pandas, and it raises a TypeError in newer versions.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the `_try_convert_to_date` function could be in the logic for handling the dtype "object" and in the for-loop that tries to parse the data into datetime with different date units.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is incorrectly converting boolean values into timestamps or attempting to convert them into datetime values, resulting in unexpected behavior when using the `read_json` method with `typ="series"` and a JSON list of booleans.

## Suggested Bug Fix Strategy
We need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values correctly and not attempt to convert them into datetime values. This can be achieved by checking the dtype of the data and performing the necessary conversion logic based on the input data type.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, True

    return new_data, False
}
```

In the corrected version, we add a check for boolean values and return the data with a flag indicating conversion success without attempting to convert them into datetime values. This fix should align the behavior with the expected output in the GitHub issue.
