The bug in the function seems to be related to the logic around converting the input data to a date column. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the data type and handling the conversion appropriately.

In Case 1, the input `data` is a RangeIndex, and the function is incorrectly identifying it as an object dtype and attempting to convert it to int64. This is unnecessary and causes the function to return the input `data` as is, leading to an incorrect result.

In Case 2, the input `data` is a Series with a boolean dtype, and the function is incorrectly identifying it as an object dtype and not making any attempts to convert it. This leads to an incorrect result where the boolean values are not correctly handled to convert to a date.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly identify the data type and handle the conversion logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.datetime64):
        return new_data, True

    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

In this corrected version, we check if the dtype of the data is `np.datetime64` and return the data as is if it is. If it's not, we attempt to convert the data using `to_datetime` and handle any errors that may occur during the conversion.

This corrected logic should properly handle the conversion of different data types to a date column.
