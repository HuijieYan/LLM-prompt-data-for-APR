## Analysis:
The buggy function is attempting to convert a ndarray into a date column by checking for different date formats, such as epoch/iso formats and integers/floats. It looks for object data type and attempts to convert it to "int64". It then checks for numbers that are out of range and tries to convert the data to datetime using the specified date units. However, there are potential issues with the conversion process and error handling.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Conversion of data to "int64" may fail if the data is not in a compatible format.
2. Filtering out numbers that are out of range might not be working properly, leading to incorrect results.
3. Error handling during the conversion to datetime could be causing the function to return incorrect results.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function is likely returning incorrect results due to problems with data conversion and error handling. In particular, the conversion to "int64" and the handling of out-of-range numbers may not be working as intended.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Add more robust error handling during the conversion process to catch and handle potential data format issues.
2. Check the logic for filtering out-of-range numbers to ensure it accurately identifies and handles them.
3. Improve the error handling during the datetime conversion to account for different date units and potential errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors='coerce')
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data < self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, pd.errors.OutOfBoundsDatetime):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected version includes the following changes:
- Use `pd.to_numeric` for more robust conversion of object data to numeric data.
- Adjust the logic for filtering out-of-range numbers to ensure accurate identification.
- Improve the error handling during the datetime conversion to account for different date units and potential errors.
