Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the `_try_convert_to_date` method failing to correctly convert bool values to a Series of bools when using `typ="series"` in the `read_json` function. The cause of the bug is likely due to the method trying to convert bool values to timestamps instead of leaving them as bools.

To fix this bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` method needs to be modified to handle bool values correctly and ensure that it returns a Series of bools as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This modified method has an additional check for bool values to ensure that they are returned as is without going through any conversion that might result in unexpected behavior.

By implementing this fix, the `read_json` function should now correctly return a Series of bools when using `typ="series"` as expected in the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
