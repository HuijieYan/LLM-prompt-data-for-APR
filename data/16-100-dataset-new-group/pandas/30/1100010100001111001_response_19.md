The bug is caused by the fact that the function is not correctly converting the input data to a date column. The function is failing to return the expected values as it is not converting the input data to the appropriate data type, and not checking for numbers that are out of range.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to correctly convert the input data to a date column and check for numbers that are out of range before proceeding with the conversion. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected version first makes sure that the data is converted to int64 if it is in an object format. Then, it checks for numbers that are out of range before attempting to convert the data to a date column using `to_datetime`. If the conversion is successful, it returns the new data and True, otherwise, it returns the original data and False.

With this correction, the function should now return the expected values for the given input cases.
