The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column. However, it currently has several issues that prevent it from working correctly.

The main issues in the buggy function are:
1. The logic for checking and converting the data type to "int64" is flawed.
2. The condition for checking if numbers are out of range is not correctly implemented.
3. The loop for trying different date units is not implemented effectively.

The potential cause of the bug is that the function is not handling and converting data types correctly, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly handle the conversion of the data type to "int64".
2. Modify the condition for checking if numbers are out of range.
3. Implement the loop for trying different date units effectively.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")  # Corrected: data should be converted to int64 directly
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data <= self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)  # Corrected: using the original 'data' instead of 'new_data'
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, the data type conversion to "int64" has been fixed, the condition for checking out of range numbers has been modified, and the loop for trying different date units has been implemented effectively. This will address the issues with the original buggy function and make it satisfy the expected input/output values.
