The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is causing issues when attempting to parse a Series of bools into a date column using the `pd.read_json` function with the `typ="series"` argument. This is causing unexpected behavior, either resulting in a TypeError or converting the bools to timestamps, which is inconsistent with the behavior when `typ="frame"` is used. The source of the bug appears to be in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, specifically when handling object dtype and boolean values.

The issue arises from the fact that the function is attempting to convert boolean values to dates, instead of keeping them as boolean values. The function then runs into issues when trying to convert the bools to timestamps or raising a TypeError. This is inconsistent with the behavior of the `typ="frame"` case, where the result is a dataframe with one column of bool values.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the function correctly handles boolean values and does not attempt to convert them to dates. Additionally, the behavior should be consistent with the `typ="frame"` case, where the result is a dataframe with boolean values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function that resolves this issue:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a Series into a date column. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        # Check if the data types are boolean and return the original data with a success flag
        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, True

        # For all other data types, attempt to convert to datetime and return the result with a success flag
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles boolean values and only attempts to convert other data types to dates, resulting in consistent behavior with `typ="frame"` and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
