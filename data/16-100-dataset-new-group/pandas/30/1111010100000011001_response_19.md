### Fix for the bug
The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` seems to be related to the logic for converting data to date and checking if the values are in range. 

The first issue is with the statement `new_data = data.astype("int64")`, which should be changed to `new_data = data.astype('int64', errors='ignore')` to handle errors that may occur during the conversion.

The second issue seems to be with the condition `if not in_range.all():`, which should be changed to `if in_range.all():` to correctly check if all the values are in range.

Also, it seems that `new_data` is being overwritten in the loop without being stored or checked properly, so this logic needs to be revisited.

Finally, it appears that `self.date_unit` may be used without being defined, so this needs to be properly handled within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype('int64', errors='ignore')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data <= self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if in_range.all():
            date_units = (self.date_unit,) if hasattr(self, 'date_unit') and self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
            for date_unit in date_units:
                try:
                    new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    continue
                return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
This corrected version handles the type conversion and the range check more effectively, and addresses the potential issue with `self.date_unit` not being defined.
