## The modification for the buggy function

The code contains a bug where the function `_try_convert_to_date` is expecting a boolean variable to be convertible to a datetime, leading to a TypeError. This bug causes the function to return unexpected results when attempting to convert boolean variables to datetime.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the input data is of type boolean before trying to convert it to a datetime. If the input data is a boolean, the function should return the data as it is, along with a boolean indicating that the parsing was unsuccessful.

Additionally, the bug causes the function to not handle boolean input properly when trying to convert it to a datetime. This issue is described in the GitHub issue "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception" and needs to be resolved.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) and new_data.dtype != "bool":
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By checking for the `bool` type and returning the data as is with a False flag if the input is a boolean, we ensure that the function can handle boolean input properly and does not raise a TypeError. This correction will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
