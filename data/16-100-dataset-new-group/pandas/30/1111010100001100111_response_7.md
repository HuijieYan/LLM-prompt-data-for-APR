## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is designed to parse a numpy array into a date column. It checks for various conditions and attempts to convert the data into date format. However, based on the provided runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it seems that the function has issues with handling boolean data, especially when the data is expected to be converted into date format.

### Error Locations
1. The function checks for the `new_data.dtype` to be "object" and tries to convert it into "int64". While this might work for some cases, it causes issues with boolean data, leading to incorrect type conversion.
2. The function then checks for numbers that are out of range and tries to ignore them, but the logic for handling boolean data is not accounted for, leading to potential issues.
3. The loop for trying to convert the data into different date units isn't handling boolean data correctly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the function's inability to handle boolean data and convert it into a date format. This is evident from the provided runtime values and types, where the input contains boolean data but it gets processed incorrectly, leading to either unexpected outputs or exceptions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle boolean data differently from other data types. It should avoid type conversions and range checks for boolean data. Additionally, it should exit the loop once the correct date format is found, to prevent unnecessary iterations.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True  # Exit the loop once the correct date format is found
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we have explicitly handled the case where `new_data` is of type "bool", preventing any type conversions or unnecessary checks. Additionally, once the correct date format is found, we exit the loop to prevent unnecessary iterations. This corrected version should address the issues reported in the GitHub bug.
