The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is causing the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` to return a series of timestamps when it should return a series of booleans. This bug can be traced to the incorrect conversion of boolean values in the input data to date values. As a result, the failing test is not passing because the expected output is a Pandas Series of bools, but the output is a series of timestamps.

To fix this bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to properly handle the conversion of boolean values and return a series with the correct data type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        else:
            if new_data.dtype == "datetime64[ns]":
            return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the conversion of boolean values and return a series with the correct data type. It should fix the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
