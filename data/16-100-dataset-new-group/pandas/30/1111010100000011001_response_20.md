## The buggy function analysis
The function `_try_convert_to_date` tries to parse a `ndarray` into a date column, coercing objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats. It then checks for numbers that are out of range and attempts to convert the data to datetime with different date units. The expected output values and types are provided in the Expected case 1 section.

## Identified potential error locations
1. The function is altering `new_data` without a clear explanation of why it needs to be changed.
2. The check for `in_range` is not providing the expected output values.
3. The loop for trying different date units may not be functioning as expected.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of `new_data` and the issue with checking for numbers that are out of range. Additionally, the loop for trying different date units might not be able to reach its intended purpose due to the structure of the function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Remove unnecessary alteration of `new_data` and make sure it is properly assigned while converting data types.
2. Revise the check for numbers that are out of range to provide the expected output values.
3. Modify the loop for trying different date units to ensure it executes for each unit and returns the correct result.
