## The buggy function analysis
The `_try_convert_to_date` function is failing when trying to convert a series of boolean values to dates. The cause of the bug is that this function doesn't handle boolean values correctly, and it raises a TypeError when attempting to convert them to datetimes. This is related to a GitHub issue titled "read_json with typ='series' of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception," where users expect the function to return a Series of bools as the output.

## Bug locations
The potential error locations in the `_try_convert_to_date` function are in the sections where the type of the data is checked and the `to_datetime` function is called.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle boolean values correctly. When it encounters a boolean value, it tries to convert it to a datetime, which raises a TypeError. This behavior is inconsistent with what users expect from the `read_json` function, as described in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values correctly. When encountering boolean values, the function should return a Series of bools instead of trying to convert them to datetimes.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    # Check if the data type is bool, return the unmodified data and a boolean flag indicating success
    if np.issubdtype(new_data.dtype, np.bool_):
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version of the function, we added a check for boolean values. If the data type is boolean, we return the unmodified data and a boolean flag indicating that the conversion to datetime was not successful. This addresses the bug by ensuring that boolean values are handled correctly, as expected by the users.
