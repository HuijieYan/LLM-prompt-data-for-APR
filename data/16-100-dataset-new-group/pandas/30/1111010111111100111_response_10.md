The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` tries to convert data into a date column and is used when parsing JSON data using the `read_json` method with the type `series`. The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is trying to create a Series of boolean values from a JSON input of `[true, true, false]`, but the function is converting the values to timestamps instead of booleans, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to convert a boolean to a datetime.

The potential error location is the conversion of data to timestamps within the `new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)` line. This is where the code incorrectly attempts to interpret boolean values as timestamps.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly converts boolean values to timestamps when trying to parse the input data. The failing test is trying to pass boolean values to the function, expecting a Series of boolean values, but the buggy function is converting them to timestamps, leading to a `TypeError` when it encounters a boolean value.

To fix the bug, the function should check for boolean values and handle them separately, ensuring that they are not converted to timestamps. Additionally, we need to ensure that the result is a Series of boolean values, as expected by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, True  # Return the boolean Series without conversion

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this fix, the function will handle boolean values separately and return them directly without conversion, ensuring that the output reflects the expected behavior from the failing test and resolves the issue described in the GitHub post.
