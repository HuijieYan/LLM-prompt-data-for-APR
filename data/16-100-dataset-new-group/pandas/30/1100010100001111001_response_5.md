The bug in the _try_convert_to_date function appears to be related to the handling of the input data. In Case 1, when the input data is a RangeIndex, the function incorrectly converts the data to int64 dtype and sets the in_range variable to all False. This is not the expected behavior, as RangeIndex should not be processed in this manner.

In Case 2, the function correctly identifies the dtype of the input data as bool and does not attempt to convert it. However, it does not handle the input as a date format, which is expected to be handled.

To fix the bug, we should correct the handling of the input data and ensure that it is appropriately converted to a date format when necessary, without altering the original data. Additionally, the in_range check should be performed considering the date format as well.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        new_data = new_data.copy()  # create a copy to avoid modifying original data
        new_data = np.where(
            (new_data <= self.min_stamp) & (~isna(new_data._values)),
            to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=self.date_unit),
            data
        )

    return new_data, not isna(new_data).all()
```

With this corrected function, it properly handles the input data according to its type and avoids unintended modifications. It also performs the date conversion and in_range check, as expected.
