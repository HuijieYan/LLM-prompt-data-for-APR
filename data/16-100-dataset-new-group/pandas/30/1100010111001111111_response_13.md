The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is supposed to parse a ndarray into a date column. However, it is failing for certain inputs, such as boolean values, which are not being handled correctly. This is causing unexpected behavior and leading to failing tests.

The potential error lies in the handling of boolean values, where the function is erroneously attempting to convert them into dates. This is likely the cause of the bug, as the function is not correctly identifying the data types and handling them appropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to explicitly handle boolean values and bypass the conversion to dates for such values. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check to handle boolean values separately, rather than trying to convert them into dates.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        # Handling boolean values separately
        return new_data, True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, we have added a conditional check to handle boolean values separately and return them as is, without attempting to convert them into dates. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function handles boolean values correctly, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values.
