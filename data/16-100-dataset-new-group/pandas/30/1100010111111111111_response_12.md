The issue in the provided function is that it attempts to convert boolean values to datetime, which results in a TypeError. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle boolean values separately and return a Series of boolean values as expected.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if len(data) == 0:
        return data, False

    # handle boolean values separately
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.bool_):
        return data, True

    new_data = data.astype("int64")

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected version handles boolean values separately and returns them directly, while continuing with the datetime conversion for other types of data. This change ensures that the function correctly handles boolean values and avoids the TypeError that was previously encountered.

With this correction, the failing test case `test_readjson_bool_series` should now pass, and the corrected function should return a Series of boolean values as expected.

This fix addresses the issue reported in GitHub, where users were expecting a Series of boolean values but were encountering a TypeError instead. With the corrected function, the output will now be consistent with user expectations.
