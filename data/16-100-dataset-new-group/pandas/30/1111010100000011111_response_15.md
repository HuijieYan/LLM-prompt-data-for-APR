### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is designed to convert input data into a date column, but it has several issues that cause it to return incorrect results when presented with a series of boolean values. These issues lead to incorrect types and values in the variable `new_data`, which in turn leads to the function returning unexpected results, causing the GitHub issue mentioned. The problem lies in the way the function handles boolean data and the checking of the date range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by checking the type of the input data. If the input data is of type boolean, the function should directly return the input data without performing any date conversion operations. This will ensure that the boolean data is preserved as is and not coerced into a date format. Additionally, the function should also include proper checks for boolean data type and handling of date range conditions.

### Corrected Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    else:
        new_data = data

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.bool_):  # Check for boolean type
        return new_data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function includes checks for boolean data type and returns the input data directly if it is boolean. It also addresses the issue with the date range conditions and includes appropriate handling for numeric data. These changes should resolve the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output for the mentioned GitHub issue.
