There are a few issues with the current function that need to be fixed. 

1. The initial check if the input `data` is empty seems incorrect. It should be checking if the length of the `data` array is 0, not the array itself.

2. In the conversion of "object" dtype to "int64", there is no assignment of the converted data back to the variable `new_data`.

3. The check for numbers that are out of range seems to be incorrect as well. It should be checking if the numbers are within the range, not out of range.

4. The return statement is returning the original `data` instead of `new_data` in the case where parsing was successful.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if len(data) == 0:
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            ~isna(new_data._values)
            & (new_data >= self.min_stamp)
            & (new_data._values != iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return new_data, False
```

With these corrections, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
