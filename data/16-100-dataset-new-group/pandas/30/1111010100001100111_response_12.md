The bug in the original `_try_convert_to_date` function is causing unexpected behavior when trying to parse a pandas series of bools as dates. The function incorrectly handles the input and fails to return the expected output. The issue is captured in the GitHub post "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception."

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly identify the data type and convert it to dates, leading to incorrect outputs. This is evident in the runtime variable values and types of the failing test cases. For example, the function incorrectly processes a Series of bools and converts them to timestamps instead of returning a Series of boolean values.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the function's logic to correctly handle different data types and convert them to date columns as needed. This can be achieved by identifying the correct data type, applying the appropriate conversion method, and returning the result in the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a Series-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="coerce", unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

In this corrected version, the function uses `to_datetime` to attempt to convert the input data to dates. It catches any potential errors and returns the original data if the conversion fails. This approach ensures that the function handles different data types appropriately and returns the expected output.

By implementing this fix, the function should now correctly parse a pandas series of bools as dates, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
