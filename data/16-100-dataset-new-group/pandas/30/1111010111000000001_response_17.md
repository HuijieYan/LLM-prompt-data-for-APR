## Analysis:
The `_try_convert_to_date` function is attempting to parse a ndarray into a date column. It checks for empty data and then tries to coerce the data into an integer format if it's an object type. It also checks for numbers that are out of range and then attempts to convert the data to datetime with different units.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. The check for empty data might not be working as intended.
2. The coercion of object type data into int64 might not be handling all cases correctly.
3. The check for numbers out of range might not be working as intended.
4. The loop for converting data to datetime with different units might not be functioning correctly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of object type data and the conversion to datetime with different units. This results in the function failing to parse the input data correctly, leading to the test failure.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the check for empty data is working as intended.
2. Improve the coercion of object type data into int64 to handle all cases correctly.
3. Verify the check for numbers out of range to ensure it's functioning correctly.
4. Revise the loop for converting data to datetime with different units to handle all cases properly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if data.size == 0:
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors="coerce")
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. Changed the check for empty data to compare the size of the data array.
2. Used `pd.to_numeric` function to coerce the object type data into int64.
3. Corrected the comparison of numbers out of range and the conversion to datetime using the `pd.to_datetime` function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
