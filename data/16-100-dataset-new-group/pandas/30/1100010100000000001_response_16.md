## Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` tries to convert a numpy array into a date column. It first checks for empty data, then tries to convert object types to `int64`, and finally attempts to convert the data to a datetime object. However, there are potential error locations in the function where exceptions are not handled properly, and the logic may not function as intended.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of the `new_data.dtype == "object"` conversion may raise exceptions that are not properly handled.
2. The check for numbers that are out of range may not work as intended due to potential errors in the condition.
3. Date conversion using `to_datetime` may raise exceptions that are not properly handled.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle exceptions properly when trying to convert object types to `int64`, checking for numbers that are out of range, and converting the data to a datetime object using `to_datetime`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add proper exception handling for the conversion of object types to `int64`.
2. Review the condition for numbers that are out of range and ensure it works as intended.
3. Add proper exception handling for the datetime conversion using `to_datetime`.
4. Refactor the function to improve readability and maintainability.
