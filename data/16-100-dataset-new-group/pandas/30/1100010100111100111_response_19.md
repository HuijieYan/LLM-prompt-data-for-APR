The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert input data to a date column, but it is encountering a TypeError because it is unable to convert boolean values to datetime objects. This issue was reported on GitHub as an inconsistency with the `typ="frame"` case, where the function works correctly and returns a DataFrame with boolean values in a single column.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The check for the dtype being "object" may mistakenly convert boolean values to int64, causing the subsequent conversion to datetime to fail.
2. The handling of boolean values without converting them to int64 or other types that are incompatible with datetime conversion.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle boolean values appropriately and return a Series of boolean values instead of attempting to convert them to datetime objects.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle boolean values appropriately and return a Series of boolean values, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
