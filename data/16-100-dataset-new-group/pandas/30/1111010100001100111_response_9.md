Based on the given information, the buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is failing to handle boolean type data correctly and is returning unexpected output. This is reflected in the GitHub issue where the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools is resulting in a series of timestamps or raising a `TypeError` in newer Pandas versions.

The issue seems to be with how the function handles boolean type data and tries to convert it to dates. Based on the provided cases, the function is converting the boolean data to dates incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function `_try_convert_to_date` should be updated to properly handle boolean type data and return the expected output. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="coerce")
            if new_data.dtype == "datetime64[ns]":
                return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we directly use `to_datetime` to convert the data to datetime, with the `errors` parameter set to "coerce". This catches the boolean data and returns it as is, without trying to convert it to dates.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the function properly handles boolean type data and returns the expected output.
