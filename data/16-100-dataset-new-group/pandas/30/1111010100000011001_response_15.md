The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function lies in the incorrect handling of the `new_data` variable and the check for numbers out of range.

The `new_data` variable is being incorrectly assigned the original `data` instead of a copy, so any modifications to `new_data` are being reflected in the original `data` as well. This is not the intended behavior.

Additionally, the `in_range` check for numbers out of range is not being correctly calculated. The logic is flawed and is not accurately identifying numbers that are out of range.

To fix the bug, we should make a copy of the `data` into the `new_data` variable, and recalculate the logic for identifying numbers that are out of range.

Here's a corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()  # make a copy of data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")  # update the copy with the converted data
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected version of the function includes making a copy of the `data` into the `new_data` variable, and fixing the logic for checking numbers that are out of range. This should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
