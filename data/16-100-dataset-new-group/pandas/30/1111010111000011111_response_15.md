## What is the potential error in the buggy function?
The potential error in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that it incorrectly attempts to parse a boolean array into a date column, which results in unexpected behavior and errors.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function incorrectly attempting to convert a boolean array into a date column. This results in unexpected behavior, including raising exceptions and returning incorrect results.

## How can we fix the bug?
To fix the bug, we can modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean arrays differently. Specifically, when encountering a boolean array, the function should convert it to a date column by interpreting `True` as some valid date value and `False` as another valid date value. This approach will ensure that the function can handle boolean arrays correctly when converting them to date columns.

Additionally, the logic for checking in range values should be adjusted to avoid unexpected behaviors when dealing with different data types.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
Below is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="coerce")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:  # Handle boolean arrays differently
        if new_data.dtype == "bool":
            new_data = new_data.map({True: pd.Timestamp("today"), False: pd.Timestamp(iNaT)})

    return new_data, True
```

In the corrected version, we have added logic to treat boolean arrays differently and map `True` to a valid date value (e.g., today's date) and `False` to another valid date value (e.g., NaT). This will ensure that boolean arrays are converted to date columns correctly.

## The updated test function that the corrected function should pass
To ensure that the corrected function passes the failing test, the `test_readjson_bool_series` should remain unchanged. The corrected function should produce the expected output when tested with this function.
