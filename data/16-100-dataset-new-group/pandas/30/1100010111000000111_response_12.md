The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is trying to parse a list of bool values into a date column, which is causing the unexpected behavior. The problem is related to the handling of boolean values as date data. This stems from a logic error in the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

The bug is causing the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` to incorrectly convert the boolean values into timestamps, instead of the expected behavior of creating a Pandas Series of boolean values.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic to explicitly handle boolean values and bypass any date-related processing for boolean data.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False  # Bypass date-related processing for boolean values

    return new_data, True
```
In the corrected version, we have added a new condition to check if the data type is boolean, in which case we return the new data as is with a `False` flag to indicate that no date parsing was performed.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` pass as expected.
