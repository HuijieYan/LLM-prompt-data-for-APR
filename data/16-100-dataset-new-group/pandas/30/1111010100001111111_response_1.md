### Bug Analysis
The `_try_convert_to_date` function is responsible for converting data into a date column. The bug seems to be causing the function to return incorrect values, and it's related to the inability to parse a Series of bools into the expected output. This bug has been identified in the GitHub issue, where the expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, but the function fails to convert it correctly.

The potential error locations in the function could be the data type coercion and the handling of boolean values.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of boolean values, leading to the wrong conversion from a Series of bools to the expected output. The function isn't correctly identifying the type and format of the input data, leading to incorrect conversions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle boolean values and ensure that the correct data type coercion is applied when necessary. Additionally, we should provide specific handling for boolean values to ensure they are properly converted to the expected output.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        # handle boolean values
        if new_data.dtype == 'bool':
            return new_data, True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected function now includes a specific handling for boolean values and ensures that the correct data type coercion is applied when necessary.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected output for the failing test cases.
