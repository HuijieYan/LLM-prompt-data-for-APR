### Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the corresponding error message and GitHub issue

The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is used to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column, trying to handle different formats of input data. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is causing a TypeError. This issue is also described in the GitHub issue, where the user expected the output to be a Series of bools, but instead, it raises a TypeError.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations are within the `for` loop where the function tries to convert the input data to datetime. It incorrectly handles boolean input values, which results in a TypeError.

### Cause of the bug

The cause of the bug stems from the function trying to convert boolean values to datetime. This can be seen in the error message and is also described in the GitHub issue. The result is inconsistent with the expected behavior and leads to unexpected errors.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle boolean input values and ensure that it distinguishes between datetime and boolean conversions. An if-else statement can be used to check the type of input values and perform the appropriate conversion.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range and handle boolean values
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False
    elif new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version of the function, a check has been added to handle boolean input values separately from datetime values. If the input data is of type bool, it returns the data as is with a parsing success of False. This will ensure that boolean values are not incorrectly converted to datetime, resolving the TypeError and addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
