The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date`, which is attempting to parse a list of boolean values into a date column, causing an error due to the logical mismatch between the data type (bool) and the function's intention to convert it to a date.

The failing test is `test_readjson_bool_series`, which attempts to parse a JSON list of boolean values into a pandas series using the `read_json` method. However, due to the bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, the parsing fails and an error is raised.

The error message states that the class `bool` is not convertible to datetime, which is expected because the `_try_convert_to_date` function incorrectly attempts to parse the input data into a date column.

The GitHub issue confirms that this is a bug and reports that the expected output of parsing a JSON list of boolean values should be a pandas series of bools, but this is not the case due to the bug.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function should be modified to handle bool values as a special case and return the data as is without attempting to parse it into a date.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return data, False  # Return the boolean data as is
    
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By adding a condition to check for boolean data type and returning it as is, the corrected function is now able to handle JSON lists of boolean values correctly.

With this fix in place, the `test_readjson_bool_series` test should pass, and the issue reported in GitHub will also be resolved.
