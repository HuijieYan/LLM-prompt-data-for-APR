## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("bool")  # Changed "int64" to "bool" here
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # validate boolean values
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, True
    else:
        return data, False
```

The correction involves converting the `new_data` to `bool` instead of `int64` when its dtype is "object". Then, it checks if the data is of type "bool" and returns it as is with a success flag. Otherwise, it returns the original data with a failure flag. This correction ensures that the function correctly handles boolean data and does not attempt to convert it to a datetime. This resolves the issue and aligns with the expected behavior.
