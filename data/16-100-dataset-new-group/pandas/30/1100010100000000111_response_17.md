Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the `read_json` method with `typ="series"` resulting in a Series of timestamps or an exception instead of a Series of bools. This issue is inconsistent with the behavior of `typ="frame"` and is causing unexpected output for users.

The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is likely causing this issue because it tries to parse an ndarray into a date column, leading to the unexpected behavior observed in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle the case of boolean arrays and return a Series of bools instead of attempting to parse them as dates. We can do this by adding a check for boolean arrays and returning the input data as-is if it is a boolean array.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this modification, when the input data is of type `bool`, the function will return the input data as-is, preventing it from being parsed as dates and resolving the issue described in the GitHub thread.
