The issue seems to be related to the `read_json` function not properly handling boolean series when `typ="series"` is specified. The expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, but it results in a series of timestamps or raises a TypeError in newer versions of pandas. 

The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` incorrectly handles the input data and does not properly check for boolean values and convert them into a proper date format. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values properly and not attempt to convert them into a date format. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        except AttributeError:  # Check if the data is already boolean
            if issubclass(data.dtype.type, bool):
                return data.astype(bool), True

    return new_data, False
```

With this corrected function, the `read_json` function should now properly handle boolean series when `typ="series"` is specified and return a Pandas Series of bools as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
