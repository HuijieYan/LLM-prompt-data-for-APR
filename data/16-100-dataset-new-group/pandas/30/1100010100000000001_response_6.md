## Explanation:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert a data array into a date column. The bug in this function lies in the handling of the `new_data` variable and the `date_units` variable. The function is not properly dealing with the conversion of `new_data` to datetime and the iteration over `date_units` is not working as expected.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Mishandling of the `new_data` variable and its conversion to datetime.
2. Iteration over the `date_units` variable and the handling of exceptions in the loop.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the mishandling of the `new_data` variable and the improper iteration over the `date_units`. This results in incorrect conversion or parsing of the data, leading to the function not returning the expected results.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `new_data` variable is properly converted to datetime in the loop over `date_units`.
2. Handle exceptions properly within the loop to ensure that any errors do not stop the entire process if there are more `date_units` to try.
3. Return the correct result based on the success of the parsing in the loop.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    success = False
    for date_unit in [self.date_unit] if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            success = True
            break
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
            
    if success:
        return new_data, True
    else:
        return data, False
``` 

In the corrected version, the function iterates over the `date_units` properly and handles exceptions within the loop. It returns the correct result based on the success of the parsing in the loop.
