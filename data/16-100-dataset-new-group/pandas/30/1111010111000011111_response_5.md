The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is causing it to incorrectly parse a series of booleans, resulting in a series of timestamps instead of a series of boolean values.

The bug is occurring because the function is attempting to convert the data to an integer using `new_data.astype("int64")`, which is causing the booleans to be represented as 0 and 1 as integers. Then, when the function attempts to parse the data as datetime, it interprets those integers as epoch time and converts them to timestamps.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean data correctly and avoid the unnecessary integer conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="coerce", unit=self.date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return new_data, False
```

With this fix, the function now correctly handles boolean data and returns a series of boolean values instead of converting them to timestamps. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
