## Analysis
The `_try_convert_to_date` function is designed to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column. However, the function does not appear to be effectively converting values to date format and might be returning incorrect output, as indicated by the GitHub issue. The issue specifies that it should output a pandas Series of bools but instead outputs a Series of timestamps or raises a TypeError in newer versions of Pandas. 

### Error Locations
- The variable `new_data` is being assigned the input data, but it should be performing a conversion to int64 if the original dtype is "object".
- The in_range array may not be correctly evaluating whether the data is in range, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Cause of the Bug
The main cause of the bug seems to be the improper handling of the data type conversion to int64 and the incorrect evaluation of whether the data is in range, leading to the unexpected output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Convert data to int64 if the original dtype is "object".
2. Evaluate whether the data is in range correctly and handle the date parsing accordingly.
3. Ensure that the function returns a pandas Series of bools as expected.

### Bug-Fixed Version
```python
class Parser():

  def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)  # fix here
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)  # fix here
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False  # fix here so that it returns the new_data

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return new_data, False  # fix here
```
I have added comments next to the lines that needed fixing. This corrected version should handle the date parsing correctly and return a pandas Series of bools as expected.
