The `read_json` method from the pandas library is being called with an input string containing boolean values, which should be properly parsed and converted into a pandas Series containing boolean values. However, the `read_json` method internally calls the `_try_convert_to_date` method to try and parse the input string as dates, even if the input contains non-date values like booleans. This is why the error message indicates that `<class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime`.

The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is the culprit here. It is trying to convert boolean values to dates, which is incorrect. The function should first check the data type and ensure that it is in a format that can be converted to a date, without attempting to convert non-date values such as booleans.

The strategy for fixing the bug is as follows:
1. Add a check at the beginning of the `_try_convert_to_date` function to verify the data type and handle non-date types appropriately.
2. If the data type is not convertible to a date, return the original data along with `False` to indicate that conversion was not successful.
3. Handle other data types such as integers and floats appropriately based on the requirements.

The corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function is provided below:

```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

            Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
            formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == bool:
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype('int64')
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        else:
            new_data = data

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors='raise', unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
``` 

After making these changes, the `_try_convert_to_date` function should now properly handle different data types and specifically address boolean values during the date conversion process. This should enable the `read_json` method to correctly handle boolean values and produce the expected pandas Series without raising a `TypeError` related to date conversion for boolean values.
