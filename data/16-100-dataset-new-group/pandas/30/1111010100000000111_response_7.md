Based on the GitHub issue and the provided function, it seems that the bug is related to the conversion of boolean values to timestamps when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"`. The issue is that the function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to coerce boolean values into timestamps, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix this bug, the strategy would be to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values properly and return a Series of boolean values instead of attempting to convert them to dates. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.bool_):
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, when the input data is of boolean type, the function immediately returns the data as is, indicating that the conversion was not successful. This should ensure that boolean series are not converted to timestamps and the function behaves as expected.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
