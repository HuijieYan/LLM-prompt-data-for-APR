## Analysis:
The `_try_convert_to_date` function is intended to parse a ndarray-like data into a date column. It first checks if the data is empty and returns the data and False if it is. Then, it attempts to coerce the data into "int64" dtype if the original dtype is "object". Next, it ignores numbers that are out of range and converts the data into datetime using the specified date units. However, the bug seems to be in the logic of coercing the data into "int64" dtype and checking for numbers out of range.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for coercing the data into "int64" dtype for objects.
2. The logic for ignoring numbers that are out of range.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the function to fail in cases where the data involves boolean values.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for coercing the data into "int64" dtype to handle boolean values as well.
2. Check for numbers out of range in a way that includes boolean values as well.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors="coerce")
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            pass

    # coerce bool into numeric
    if new_data.dtype == 'bool':
        new_data = new_data.astype('int64')

    # convert to datetime
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", utc=True)
        valid_date = new_data.notnull().all()
        return new_data, valid_date
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```
In the corrected version, the logic for coercing the data into "int64" dtype for objects has been updated to use `pd.to_numeric` with `errors="coerce"` to handle boolean values as well. The logic for checking numbers out of range has been removed and the conversion to datetime has been simplified with a single `to_datetime` call and validity check for the dates.
