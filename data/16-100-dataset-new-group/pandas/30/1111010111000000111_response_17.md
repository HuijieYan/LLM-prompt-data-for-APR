## Analysis
The `_try_convert_to_date` function is designed to parse a pandas DataFrame column into a date column. However, the current implementation is causing issues when parsing a JSON array of booleans into a pandas Series, as indicated by the failing test and the related GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the `_try_convert_to_date` function are:
1. Handling of boolean data type within the function.
2. The logic of parsing the data into date units.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of the boolean data type within the function. The function is trying to convert boolean values into date units due to a faulty conditional check, causing the conversion to fail and producing unexpected results (timestamps or exceptions). This behavior is inconsistent with the expected output; a pandas Series of booleans is desired, not timestamps or exceptions.

To fix the bug, the boolean data type should be handled separately and returned as is, instead of trying to parse it into date units. 

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the data type of the input and handle the boolean data type separately.
2. If the input data type is boolean, return the data as is without any further conversion.
3. If the input data type is not boolean, proceed with the existing logic for other data types.
4. Remove the faulty conditional check causing the improper conversion of boolean values.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. 
    Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # handle boolean data type separately
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By handling the boolean data type separately and avoiding the faulty conditional check, the corrected version of the function should now be able to parse the JSON array of booleans into a pandas Series without producing timestamps or exceptions. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
