The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that there is no actual conversion of the data to date happening. Instead, it checks if the data is already in range and if its dtype is 'object' and, if so, attempts to convert it to int64. However, this does not address the main goal of converting the data to a date column.

To fix this bug, we need to include the actual conversion of the data to a date column. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the data is already in a date format, and there is no need for conversion.

Below is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == "datetime64":
            return data, True

        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
            return new_data, True
        except:
            return data, False
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly convert the input to a date column and return a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful.

This should address the issue identified in the failing test cases. However, it's important to note that the input types and values for the failing test are not provided and they are crucial for confirming that the correction works as expected.
