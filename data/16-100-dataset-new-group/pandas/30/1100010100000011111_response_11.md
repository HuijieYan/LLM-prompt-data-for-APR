There is a GitHub issue related to the read_json function with typ="series" of a JSON list of bools resulting in timestamps or an exception instead of a Pandas Series of bools. The issue appears to be caused by inconsistent behavior and the lack of expected output.

The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` in the pandas/io/json/_json.py file attempts to parse a ndarray into a date column using various coercions and checks. However, the issue described in GitHub suggests that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of a list of bools into a Pandas Series of bools, resulting in either timestamps or an exception when it should return a Series of bools.

To fix the bug, the function `_try_convert_to_date` needs to be modified to handle the conversion of a list of bools into a Pandas Series of bools, consistent with the behavior when `typ="frame"` is used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False
    
    # Additional handling for bool data type
    if new_data.dtype == 'bool':
        return new_data, True
    
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected function now includes an additional check for the bool data type and returns the new_data as-is with a boolean flag if the input data is of type bool. This ensures that the function correctly handles the conversion of a list of bools into a Pandas Series of bools.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the function meets the expected input/output values for this specific case.
