The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is causing the `read_json` function to raise a TypeError when attempting to parse a list of boolean values as a Series. This issue is described in detail on the GitHub page under the title "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception." The expected output should be a Pandas Series of boolean values, but instead, it raises a TypeError.

The bug is likely located in the block where the function attempts to convert the input data to datetime formats. The TypeError is raised at the part of the code where it tries to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not the intended behavior for this function.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve adding a check to validate the data type of the input. If the input data is of boolean type, it should be returned directly without attempting to convert it to datetime.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function that addresses the bug:

```python
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        # Check if the data is a boolean type, return the original data if it is
        if data.dtype == bool:
            return data, True
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check for boolean data types and returns the original data with a success flag, bypassing the unnecessary conversion to datetime. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
