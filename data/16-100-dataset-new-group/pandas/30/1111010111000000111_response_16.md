## Steps:
1. Analyzing the buggy function: The `_try_convert_to_date` function is part of the Parser class in the `_json.py` file. It seems to be responsible for converting input data to a date format, but it is failing in some cases, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue.
2. Potential error locations: The error might be occurring when converting data of type "object" to "int64", and it might not be handling boolean values appropriately.
3. Cause of the bug: The failing test and the GitHub issue both indicate that when using `read_json` with `typ="series"`, input data that consists of boolean values results in timestamps or exceptions instead of the expected Pandas Series of boolean values. This behavior is caused by a bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function.
4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by handling boolean values in the `_try_convert_to_date` function. Additionally, the function should be modified to correctly handle the conversion of boolean values to the appropriate date format.
5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                if new_data.dtype == "bool":
                    return new_data, True
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
This corrected version includes a fix to handle boolean values correctly and ensure that the function returns a boolean if the parsing was successful. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
