The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date` which is used to coerce a column of data into a date column. The GitHub issue mentions that the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools results in timestamps/exceptions instead of a Series of bools. This indicates that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is incorrectly coercing the data into timestamps instead of preserving the bool data type.

The cause of the bug is that the function erroneously attempts to parse the bool data as timestamps, leading to the unexpected behavior and the raising of a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to correctly handle the coercion of bool data and avoid attempting to convert it into timestamps. We should also ensure that the function returns the expected values and types of variables as defined in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    
    # ensure that bool data type is preserved
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected function, if the input data is of type "bool", the function will simply return the original data and a boolean `True`, signifying that the parsing was successful. For other data types, the function will proceed with the necessary coercion and datetime parsing as before. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub while also correctly handling the expected input/output values.
