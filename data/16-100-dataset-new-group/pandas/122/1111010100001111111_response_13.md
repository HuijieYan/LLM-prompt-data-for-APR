The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly considering the order of the blocks when comparing two BlockManagers.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also include the block's position in the sorting. This will ensure that the blocks are compared correctly based on both their data type and their position.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.mgr_locs.indexer,
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the BlockManagers and return the expected output.
