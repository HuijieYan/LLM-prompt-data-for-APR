## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. The `canonicalize` function is defined in the class but not used within the `equals` method. It seems there's an intent to use it to sort the blocks for comparison. 
2. The comparison logic at the end, using the `equals` method between corresponding blocks, seems to have a faulty implementation.

## The source code of the corrected function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Use the canonicalize function to sort the blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
   
    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function now uses the `canonicalize` method directly for sorting the blocks. It then compares the sorted blocks using the `equals` method, which should resolve the issue.
