The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class incorrectly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations, contrary to the expected behavior of returning False. The cause of this bug is in the comparison of the `block` and `oblock` within the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The bug is due to the inconsistent order of the blocks, even if their contents are identical.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to use the block values instead of the `mgr_locs`. Then, we need to update the comparison in the return statement to compare the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the modified `canonicalize` function. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account the values of the blocks rather than their order, resulting in the correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method will now properly compare the block values and their data types, ensuring that the comparison is consistent and returns the correct result. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
