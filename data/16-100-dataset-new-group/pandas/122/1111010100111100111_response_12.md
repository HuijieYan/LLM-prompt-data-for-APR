The bug in the `equals` function appears to be causing it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames that should be considered not equal. This is evident from the failing test message, as well as the provided runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue. 

The key issue appears to be in the block comparison within the `equals` function. It is not properly handling the comparison of blocks from different dataframes with different locations. This results in the incorrect return of `True` when the two dataframes are not actually equal.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the block comparison logic within the `equals` function to account for different block positions when comparing dataframes.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then block items
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the canonicalized blocks
    for i, block in enumerate(self_blocks):
        if not block.equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the `canonicalize` function to include the block items (locations) as part of the canonicalization process. Additionally, we are iterating through the canonicalized blocks and comparing each pair, returning `False` if any pair is not equal.

This correction should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, ensuring that the `equals` function returns the correct result when comparing two DataFrames.
