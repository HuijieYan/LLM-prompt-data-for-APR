The bug in the buggy function is causing the test to fail with the error message "assert True is False." This means that the buggy function is returning True instead of False when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method. 

The potential cause of the bug is that the comparison is not handling the block order properly, leading to incorrect results. This is evident from the sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the canonicalized block order. 

To fix the bug, the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` needs to be modified to correctly handle the block order.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function will handle the block order correctly, ensuring that the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` produces the expected result based on the block order.
