The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the comparison of BlockManager objects properly, leading to incorrect results. The function compares the axes, number of blocks, and block contents between two BlockManager objects for equality. In the provided case, the function fails to return the expected result due to issues with comparing the blocks.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately compare the block contents between the two BlockManager objects. This includes properly sorting the blocks and comparing their contents.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # comparing the blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```
