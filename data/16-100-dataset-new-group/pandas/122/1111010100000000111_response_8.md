The issue with the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is that it returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is not the expected behavior. This issue occurs when comparing two DataFrames with different column orders.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on their content, regardless of their order. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare blocks based on their content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tobytes())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

The modification involves sorting the blocks using the `values` attribute, which contains the actual content of the block. This ensures that the blocks are compared based on their content rather than their order.

By implementing this change, the `equals` function will correctly return `False` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks and different locations.
