Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function and the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution, it can be identified that the bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is called from the wrong part of the code, which causes incorrect block order canonicalization. 

The incorrect block order canonicalization leads to the `equals` function returning True when it should return False, as identified in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be moved inside the `BlockManager` class so that it can be called as a method on the `BlockManager` objects properly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    # this is the corrected function
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # this is the corrected buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With the corrected version of the function, the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
