The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` method. This method is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The function currently fails to correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects and is causing a failure in the test.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not correctly comparing the two `BlockManager` instances. In the given function, it compares the axes of the two objects and also sorts the blocks within the objects to determine equality. However, the comparison logic does not correctly capture the actual data comparison and is leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to correctly compare the contents of the two `BlockManager` objects, not just the axes and blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False
    
    if not self.shape == other.shape:
        return False
    
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    
    # Compare the values of the two BlockManager objects
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the equality check is based on the equality of the values within the `BlockManager` objects, ensuring that the actual data is being compared. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
