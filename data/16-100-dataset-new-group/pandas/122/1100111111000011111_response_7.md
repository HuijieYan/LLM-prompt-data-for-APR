The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The `equals` method is used to check if two BlockManager objects are equal. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file checks if two DataFrames are equal, and it expects them to be False. However, the `equals` method mistakenly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations, leading to the failing test case.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect comparison of blocks and their locations within the `equals` method. When comparing the blocks, the method does not consider the locations of the blocks. As a result, even if the blocks have the same data but different locations, the method incorrectly returns True.

To fix the bug, the comparison within the `equals` method should take into account the locations of the blocks. Specifically, the canonicalize function needs to correctly differentiate blocks based on their type, name, and locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
# Your corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function now considers the block's values and its locations when sorting the blocks. This ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations will be correctly distinguished.

With this correction, the `equals` method should now properly compare the blocks and their locations, resolving the bug and causing the failing test case to pass.
