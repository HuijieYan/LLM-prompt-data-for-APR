The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the difference in the order of the blocks when comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. This difference in block order causes the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the ordering of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is consistent. We can achieve this by using a unique identifier for each block when sorting them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_identifier(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.__hash__())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_identifier)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_identifier)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a `block_identifier` function is defined to provide a unique identifier for each block based on type and location hash. This ensures that blocks are sorted consistently when comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, fixing the bug.
