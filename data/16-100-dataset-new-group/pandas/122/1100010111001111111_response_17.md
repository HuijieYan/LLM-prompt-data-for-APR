Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, it seems the issue lies in the canonicalization of block order in the `equals` function. It sorts the blocks based on the block type and locations, which causes identical blocks with different locations to be considered as different, leading to the function returning False when it should return True. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the canonicalization process to consider only the block type for sorting, rather than including block locations. This change will allow identical blocks with different locations to be considered as equal, resolving the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modify the canonicalization process to consider only the block type for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now correctly handle identical blocks with different locations and return the expected result, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
