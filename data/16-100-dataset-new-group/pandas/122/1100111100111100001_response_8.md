The bug in the given function is likely due to the incorrect comparison of DataFrame objects.

The buggy function compares two BlockManager instances representing DataFrames by comparing their axes and blocks attributes. However, it does not handle the comparison correctly, leading to the failing test "assert df1.equals(df2) is False".

To fix this bug, we need to modify the equals function to properly compare the two DataFrames. We should first compare the index and column names of the DataFrames, followed by comparing the values in the DataFrames directly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected version first checks if the axes are equal. If they are not, it returns False. Then, it iterates through each block in the DataFrames and compares them. If any block is not equal, it returns False. If all checks pass, it returns True.

This corrected version should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
