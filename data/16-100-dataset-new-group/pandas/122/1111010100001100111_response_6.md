The buggy function `equals` of the class `BlockManager` is causing issues with returning the correct comparison between two block managers. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of the expected `False` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

The potential bug locations within the `equals` function arise from the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, as well as the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the sorting of the blocks and the comparison of their equality. The sorting is performed using the `canonicalize` function, which orders the blocks based on their data type and manager locations. If two block managers have identical blocks with different locations, the sorting process will not distinguish between them, leading to a false positive result in the `equals` comparison.

To fix the bug, the sorting and comparison process based on the block locations should be re-evaluated. The equality comparison should not solely rely on the order and locations of the blocks, especially if the actual data within the blocks is identical.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare individual blocks for equality
    for block in self.blocks:
        if block not in other.blocks:
            return False
    for block in other.blocks:
        if block not in self.blocks:
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through each block in `self.blocks` and checks if it exists in `other.blocks`, and vice versa. If a block in one set is not found in the other, the function returns `False`. This approach ensures that the equality comparison includes the actual content of the blocks, not just their locations.
