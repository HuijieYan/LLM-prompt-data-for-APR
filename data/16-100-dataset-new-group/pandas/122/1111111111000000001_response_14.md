#### Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. It first checks if the axes of the two instances are equal, then consolidates them in place, compares the number of blocks they contain, and finally compares the blocks for equality.
- The bug seems to be in the sorting of the self_blocks and other_blocks based on the canonicalize function.

#### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the `canonicalize` function not being defined correctly and causing the sorting of blocks to fail.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Redefine the `canonicalize` function in the `BlockManager` class, as it seems to be related to the `Block` class and should be defined within the `BlockManager` class.

#### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # redefine the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
