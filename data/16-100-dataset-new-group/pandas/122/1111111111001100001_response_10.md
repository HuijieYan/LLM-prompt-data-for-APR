The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal. The function fails to compare the block data correctly due to a misguided attempt to canonicalize the block order.

The buggy function's approach to canonicalizing the block order is causing the failure. The function first sorts the blocks for each `BlockManager` instance based on a canonicalization function that takes the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. However, the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is not a valid attribute or method of the `mgr_locs` object. This results in an error that prevents the comparison logic from executing correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the canonicalization function to generate a tuple using the dtype name and the index of the block. Then, we can continue with the comparison as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on dtype and index
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, other.blocks.index(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should pass the failing test.
