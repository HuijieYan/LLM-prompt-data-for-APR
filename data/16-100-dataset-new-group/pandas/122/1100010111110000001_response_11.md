The buggy function is the equals method in the managers.py file of the pandas library. The method is used to compare two dataframes for equality.

The potential error in the buggy function is in the canonicalize function, which sorts the blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs. This sorting can lead to incorrect comparison results when the dataframes have different types or unconsolidated blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the canonicalize function does not handle the case where the datatype of the two dataframes is different, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to account for different datatypes in the dataframes. We can also add a check in the equals method to compare the datatypes of the two dataframes before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, type(other.blocks[0])):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        else:
            return (None, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the equals method should now correctly handle dataframes with different datatypes and produce the expected comparison results.
