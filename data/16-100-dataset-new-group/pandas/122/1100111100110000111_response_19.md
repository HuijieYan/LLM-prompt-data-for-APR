### Analysis:
The issue is related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method in Pandas, where it wrongly returns True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, which means the `DataFrame.equals()` method is returning True when it should be False.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely to be in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, where the comparison of blocks is occurring.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks. The method `equals` is erroneously returning True even when the blocks have different locations within the DataFrame.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should be revised to consider the identical blocks with different locations as not equal. The comparison logic should be updated to account for block locations as well.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        # Check for identical blocks with different locations
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        block_equality = []
        for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
            block1 = self.blocks[i]
            block2 = other.blocks[i]
            if not block1.equals(block2):
                block_equality.append(False)
            else:
                # Compare block locations
                if (block1.mgr_locs.as_array != block2.mgr_locs.as_array).any():
                    block_equality.append(False)
                else:
                    block_equality.append(True)

        # Return True only if all blocks are equal including their locations
        return all(block_equality)
```

The corrected version takes into account the comparison of block locations in addition to the equality of the blocks themselves. This should ensure that the `DataFrame.equals()` method returns the correct result for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
