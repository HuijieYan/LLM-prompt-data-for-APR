The bug in the provided function `equals` is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion to fail in the test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The function is failing to correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrame objects and returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion error.

The cause of the bug is in the logic for comparing blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The function is not properly canonicalizing block order to compare blocks with different locations. This is leading to an incorrect comparison and the function returning `True` even when the DataFrames are not equal in terms of block values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for canonicalizing block order appropriately and then compare the blocks between the two DataFrames in a consistent manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs
        return (block.values, mgr_locs.block, mgr_locs.bstart, mgr_locs.blen)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a proper method for canonicalizing block order, ensuring that blocks with different locations are compared correctly, leading to a correct output in the `equals` function. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
