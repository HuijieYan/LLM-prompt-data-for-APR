The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.

The potential error in the function is that it is not correctly comparing the data values of the two `BlockManager` objects. This can lead to the function returning incorrect results when comparing two different DataFrames.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not properly comparing the data blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. This results in the test case `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failing with the error message `assert True is False`.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be modified to correctly compare the data values of the two `BlockManager` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Sort and compare the data values of the blocks
        self_blocks = set(
            (blk._get_values().data.tobytes(), blk.dtype, blk.mgr_locs)
            for blk in self.blocks
        )
        other_blocks = set(
            (blk._get_values().data.tobytes(), blk.dtype, blk.mgr_locs)
            for blk in other.blocks
        )
        
        return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function now correctly compares the data values of the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects, ensuring that the equality check behaves as expected. This should resolve the failing test case.
