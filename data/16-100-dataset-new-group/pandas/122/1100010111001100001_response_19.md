It appears that the `canonicalize` function is failing to correctly compare the blocks of the two dataframes, causing the `equals` function to return an incorrect result.

The `canonicalize` function is being used to sort the blocks of the dataframes by their dtype name and manager locations. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block is not being properly processed, leading to an incorrect ordering and comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks. We can convert the `mgr_locs` object to a list so that it can be sorted correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, when the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is run, it should pass as the bug has been fixed.
