To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are consistent. The bug in the function is that `block.mgr_locs` is being accessed without belonging to a block object, and also the order of the blocks is not being consistently handled between `self` and `other`.

We can resolve this issue by modifying the `canonicalize` helper function to receive the block as a parameter and to access `mgr_locs` from there. Then, we need to update the sorting method calls for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to use the modified `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to handle mgr_locs from the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)  # Using the modified canonicalize function
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)  # Using the modified canonicalize function
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now compare the blocks consistently, which will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub. The corrected function should now return the expected output of `False` for the failing test case provided.
