## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function compares the axes of two different DataFrame objects, but it doesn't handle cases where the axes might be in different orders.
2. The sorting of blocks based on the canonicalization function might not always result in the correct comparison.

## Cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the failing test, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information:
The bug arises because the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class does not handle cases where the axes of two DataFrame objects are in different orders. The failing test tries to compare two DataFrames and expects the result to be `False`. However, the comparison fails, and the assertion error occurs because the comparison method does not consider the order of the axes.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the `equals` method is not returning the expected result in cases where the blocks have different locations.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by:
1. Sorting the axes of both DataFrame objects before comparison to ensure that the comparison considers axis order.
2. Improving the canonicalization logic to handle various data types and block structures.

## The corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    self_axes_sorted = sorted(self_axes, key=lambda x: x.name)
    other_axes_sorted = sorted(other_axes, key=lambda x: x.name)
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes_sorted, other_axes_sorted)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This corrected version of the `equals` function:
1. Sorts the axes of both DataFrame objects before comparison to ensure that the comparison considers axis order.
2. Improves the canonicalization logic to consider data types, shapes, and block locations for comparison.

With these changes, the `equals` method should now handle cases where the blocks have different locations and return the correct result.
