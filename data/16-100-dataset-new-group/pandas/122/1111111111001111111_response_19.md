## Correction of the buggy function

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside of the `BlockManager` class and once inside it. This causes the function to be overridden and leads to incorrect block canonicalization, resulting in the `equals` function wrongly returning `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `canonicalize` function from outside the `BlockManager` class and ensure that the `canonicalize` function inside the class is used when comparing blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring that the correct `canonicalize` function inside the `BlockManager` class is used, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now return the expected result for the failing test case.
