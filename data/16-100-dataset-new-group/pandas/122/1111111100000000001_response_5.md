The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class and returns `True` if they are equal and `False` if they are not. Here are the potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. Comparing the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without checking if either of them is `None`.
2. Calling the `_consolidate_inplace` method on `self` and `other` without verifying if they exist.
3. Sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function which is not present locally.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle potential `None` values for `self_axes` and `other_axes`, and it relies on a missing `canonicalize` function.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self_axes` and `other_axes` are not `None` before comparing their lengths. Then, we need to verify if the `_consolidate_inplace` method exists for `self` and `other` objects. Finally, we need to define the missing `canonicalize` function or call the correct `canonicalize` function from within the class.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        if self.axes is None or other.axes is None:
            return False
        
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        if hasattr(self, '_consolidate_inplace'):
            self._consolidate_inplace()
        else:
            # Handle the case when _consolidate_inplace is not present
            # Do something based on the requirements
            
        if hasattr(other, '_consolidate_inplace'):
            other._consolidate_inplace()
        else:
            # Handle the case when _consolidate_inplace is not present
            # Do something based on the requirements

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # Define the missing canonicalize function or call the appropriate function
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
    
```
