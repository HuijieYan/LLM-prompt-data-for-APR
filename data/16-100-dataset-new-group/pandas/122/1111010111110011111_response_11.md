To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the sorting of the blocks and the comparison logic. The sorted blocks should be compared based on their dtype and locations to ensure the correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort and compare blocks based on dtype and locations
    def key(block):
        return block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
