The cause of the bug is that the function `equals` is not properly comparing the `blocks` within the `BlockManager` object. This can lead to the function wrongfully returning `True` in cases where the blocks have different locations, as demonstrated in the GitHub issue and the runtime values provided.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects in the `equals` function, ensuring that their content and location are both taken into consideration.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    for i, block in enumerate(self_blocks):
        if not block.equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through each block in `self_blocks` and compare it with the corresponding block in `other_blocks`. If any pair of blocks are not equal, the function returns `False`. If all blocks are equal, the function returns `True`. This approach considers both the content and the location of the blocks when performing the comparison, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub post.
