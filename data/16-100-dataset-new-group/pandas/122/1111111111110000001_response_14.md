The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class. The function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances and determine if they are equal. It uses the `axes` and `blocks` attributes of the `BlockManager` instances to perform the comparison.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. Comparing the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without handling potential `None` values.
2. Calling the `_consolidate_inplace` method on `self` and `other` without checking for existing blocks.
3. Sorting and comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` without ensuring that they contain the same types of blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not handle potential `None` values for `self_axes` and `other_axes`, leading to a comparison error. Additionally, the function calls `_consolidate_inplace` without first checking if there are any blocks, leading to an error when trying to access the `blocks` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to add checks for potential `None` values in the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, as well as for the existence of blocks before calling `_consolidate_inplace`. Additionally, we should ensure that the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` contain the same types of blocks before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if self_axes is None or other_axes is None or len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if self.blocks is not None and other.blocks is not None:
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
    else:
        return False
```

With these changes, the `equals` function should now handle potential `None` values, check for the existence of blocks, and ensure that the blocks being compared are of the same type. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
