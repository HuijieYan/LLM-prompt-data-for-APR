The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates that the `equals` function is not correctly identifying two different DataFrames as unequal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Comparison of the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`
2. Comparison of individual axes using the `equals` method
3. Sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using a custom `canonicalize` key function

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. It does not account for the DataFrames being in different order, which should be identified as unequal.

To fix the bug, the comparison process should be updated to consider the actual content of the DataFrames, rather than just their structure.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        # Compare each element of the axes, return False if any do not match
        if not all(isinstance(ax1, ax2.__class__) and ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
            return False
        
        # Consolidate both BlockManager instances
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        # Check if consolidated blocks are of different length, return False if they are
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Loop over corresponding blocks and compare them
        for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
            block1 = self.blocks[i]
            block2 = other.blocks[i]
            if not block1.equals(block2):
                return False

        # If all comparisons pass, return True
        return True
```

By implementing these changes, we ensure that the function will properly compare the content of the two DataFrames, rather than just their structure. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
