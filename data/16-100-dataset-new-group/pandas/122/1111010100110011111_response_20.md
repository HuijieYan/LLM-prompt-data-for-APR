The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas` does not return the correct boolean value when comparing two DataFrames. This issue has been reported on GitHub as "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations." The failing test is comparing two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, using the `equals` method, and expects it to return `False`. However, the function incorrectly returns `True`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Comparing the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without checking if they have the same elements.
2. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which might not take into account all relevant components.


The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class does not handle the comparison of blocks with different locations correctly. It fails to account for differences in block locations, leading to incorrect equality comparison results.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison logic to consider block locations when comparing blocks. This may involve redefining the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the comparison process.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize_with_locs(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_with_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_with_locs)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a new `canonicalize_with_locs` function is defined to include block locations in the comparison. This function considers the block's dtype, mgr_locs, and values when sorting the blocks for comparison.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return the correct boolean value when comparing two DataFrames.
