The buggy function is attempting to compare two BlockManager objects `self` and `other` for equality. It appears that the comparison is failing due to the different ordering of the blocks within the BlockManager objects.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not take into account the ordering of blocks within the BlockManager objects, resulting in false negatives when comparing equality.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to account for the block ordering before performing the comparison for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on mgr_locs before comparison
    def get_mgr_locs(block):
        return block.mgr_locs.indexer

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_mgr_locs)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks before comparison based on their `mgr_locs`, we ensure that the equality comparison is performed in a consistent order, addressing the issue of false negatives in the test cases.
