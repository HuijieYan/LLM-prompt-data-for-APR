To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue described in the GitHub report. The problem arises from the fact that when comparing two dataframes with identical blocks but different locations, the `equals` function wrongly returns True. 

The issue is with the sorting of blocks based on their data type and location using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting leads to incorrect comparison results due to the potential for unconsolidated blocks, such as Categorical data, which can only be distinguished by the iteration order.

To correct the bug, we should consider the equality of these unconsolidated blocks and their locations. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

The corrected function addresses the bug by considering the equality of unconsolidated blocks and their locations. With this fix, the `equals` function should now return the correct comparison result and pass the failing test.
