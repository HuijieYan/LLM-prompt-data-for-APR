The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that it is not properly comparing the blocks of data within the DataFrames. The function first compares the axes of the DataFrames, and if they match, it proceeds to compare the blocks. However, when comparing the blocks, it fails to consider different block locations, which leads to incorrect equality results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to take into account the block locations when comparing the blocks between two DataFrames. We should sort the blocks based on their type and locations and then compare them for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort the blocks based on type and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly compare the blocks of data in the DataFrames, considering their type and locations. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and also satisfy the expected input/output values.
