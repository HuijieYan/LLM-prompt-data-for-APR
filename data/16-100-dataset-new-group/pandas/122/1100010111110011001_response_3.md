The bug in the `equals` function is likely causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. The error message indicates that the `assert` statement is comparing `True` to `False`, which is unexpected.

The bug is likely related to how the `equals` function is comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. It seems that the comparison is not producing the expected result, causing the assertion to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the DataFrames based on their axes and blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks using equals method
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and satisfy the expected input/output values.
