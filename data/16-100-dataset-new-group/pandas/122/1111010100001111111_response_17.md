The bug in the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class causes the function to return `True` incorrectly. The issue is related to incorrectly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. the comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. the comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
3. the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect return of `True` when comparing identical blocks.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization of blocks should be adjusted to handle the different block locations during comparison. Additionally, the comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` and `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` needs to be verified to ensure it accurately reflects the equality of the blocks. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if any(not ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the check for equality of axes has been updated to return `False` if any of the axes are not equal. The canonicalization of the blocks has also been adjusted to handle different block locations in the comparison. Additionally, the comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` has been kept, as it accurately reflects the equality of the blocks. These changes should rectify the bug and ensure that the function returns the correct result.
