The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is likely causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations. This is evident from the GitHub issue where a simple test case failed to return the expected `False` value.

The issue within the buggy function lies in the comparison of blocks and the order in which they are sorted. When comparing the blocks, the function should consider the content of the blocks and not just their order or location.

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks needs to be modified to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just their order. Additionally, the sorting mechanism should prioritize the content of the blocks when determining their equality.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and the actual content of the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, id(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now generates a tuple that includes the values of the block and an identifier (e.g. the memory address) to ensure uniqueness. This ensures that the block comparison considers the actual content of the blocks and doesn't rely solely on their order or location.

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will now properly compare the blocks based on their content, providing the expected output as described in the GitHub issue.
