## Correction:

The issue seems to stem from the way the blocks are being sorted and compared in the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type names and manager locations, but it seems to be causing issues when comparing the blocks.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to get a unique value for each block before sorting. We can achieve this by combining the hash values of the block dtype and the array representation of the manager locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        unique_value = hash(block.dtype) + hash(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
        return unique_value

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function generates a unique value for each block, ensuring proper sorting and comparison. This should address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and make the failing test pass.
