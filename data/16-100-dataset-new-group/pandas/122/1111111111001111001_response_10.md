The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class seems to be related to the comparison of the `mgr_locs` attribute of `block` when canonicalizing the blocks. Instead of accessing `mgr_locs` as an attribute, the bug causes it to be accessed as a method when comparing different blocks. 

To fix this bug, you need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly access `mgr_locs`. Furthermore, the differentiation between blocks based on their dtype is also likely incorrect and needs to be revisited.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.items, block._get_dtype_counts()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.items, block._get_dtype_counts()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction uses a lambda function to sort the blocks based on their items and dtype counts, addressing the issue with the original `canonicalize` function. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
