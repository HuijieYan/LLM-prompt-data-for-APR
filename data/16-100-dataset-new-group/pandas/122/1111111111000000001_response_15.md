The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is that it is not correctly comparing the dataframes. The bug causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail because the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be `False` for the given input dataframes.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the comparison of the dataframes is done correctly. This can be achieved by comparing the values of the dataframes directly instead of sorting and comparing blocks as the current implementation does.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False
    return (self.values == other.values).all()
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the shapes of the dataframes are the same. If they are not, we return `False`. If the shapes are the same, we compare the values of the dataframes directly using the `==` operator and then applying `.all()` to check if all values are equal. This ensures that the comparison is done on the actual data in the dataframes.
