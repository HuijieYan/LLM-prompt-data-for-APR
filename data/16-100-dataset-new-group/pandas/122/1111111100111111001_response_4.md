The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison of two BlockManagers (`self` and `other`), where the `equals` method does not produce the expected result.

The comparison first checks if the number of axes in both BlockManagers is the same, which is a valid check. Then, it iterates over each axis to compare them. After that, it consolidates both BlockManagers in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method. Finally, it compares the number of blocks in both BlockManagers and then sorts the blocks and compares each of them individually.

The bug might be related to the sorting and comparison of the blocks, as the error message indicates that the comparison is yielding a `True` result when it should be `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to closely examine the sorting and comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function, as that is where the unexpected behavior is occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare the BlockManagers' blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values._data, block.values._typ))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values._data, block.values._typ))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the sorting and comparison of the blocks is done based on their values and types, which should produce the expected result when comparing the two BlockManagers.
