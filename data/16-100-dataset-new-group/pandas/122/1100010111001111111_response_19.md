The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function fails to correctly identify when two DataFrames are not equal due to differences in block locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic for the blocks within the `BlockManager` and ensure that block locations are taken into account during the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The crucial change is in the `canonicalize` function, where we convert the `mgr_locs` to a string representation to ensure that it is included in the comparison. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and correctly handle cases where block locations differ between DataFrames.
