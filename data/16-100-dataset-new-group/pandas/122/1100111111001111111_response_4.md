The buggy function is `equals(self, other)`. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances, and it fails to return the correct result when the blocks have identical content but different locations.

Based on the failing test case and the runtime input/output values, the bug appears to be caused by the method used to compare the blocks and not taking into account the possible different locations of the identical blocks.

To fix the bug, the sorting of blocks and comparison needs to consider the block locations and type names. Additionally, the canonicalization function needs to take into account the block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_tuples())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison of blocks takes into account their locations and type names, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
