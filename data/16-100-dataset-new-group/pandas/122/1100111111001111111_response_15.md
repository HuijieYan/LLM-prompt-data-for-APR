To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function and ensure that the blocks are sorted based on the correct canonicalization. In the buggy function, the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the `BlockManager` class and once inside. The one inside the `BlockManager` class is not being used where it is supposed to be used.

We need to remove the `canonicalize` function from the `BlockManager` class and ensure that it is called from within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... other methods

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Define the canonicalize function outside the equals function
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)  # Use the correct canonicalize function here
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)  # Use the correct canonicalize function here
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager` and return the expected results, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
