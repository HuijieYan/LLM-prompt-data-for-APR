### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` and determining if they are equal. The bug causes it to return True in cases where the blocks are identical but located in different positions, which is incorrect behavior.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Sorting and comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on block type and locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function without taking into account the locations of the blocks. In scenarios where identical blocks exist in different locations within `BlockManager`, the function incorrectly identifies them as unequal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to consider the locations of the blocks when checking for equality.
2. Modify the logic for sorting and comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to include the block locations in addition to the block type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def get_block_key(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block._loc)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_key)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `get_block_key` function is added to generate a unique key for each block based on its type and location. This key is then used for sorting and comparing the blocks when checking for equality. This modification ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are not incorrectly identified as unequal.
