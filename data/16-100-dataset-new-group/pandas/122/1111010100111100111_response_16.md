### Bugs and Issues Analysis
- The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances to check for equality.
- The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is failing, as it is returning `True` instead of `False`.
- The failing test provides runtime input/output values for the function.
- The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals` method is not returning the expected result when comparing the two DataFrames.

### Potential Error Locations
- The comparison logic inside the `equals` function.
- The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The comparison logic in the `equals` function is not correctly identifying the inequality between the two BlockManagers.
2. The sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function might not be capturing the correct order for comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Review the comparison logic to ensure it correctly identifies the inequality between the two BlockManagers.
2. Examine the `canonicalize` function to verify if it captures the correct block order for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Check for block-wise equality
        for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
            if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
                return False
            
        return True
```

### Explanation of the Correction
1. The updated `equals` function iterates through each block in `self.blocks` and compares the corresponding block from `other.blocks`.
2. If any pair of blocks are not equal, it returns `False`, indicating that the BlockManagers are not equal.
3. If all block comparisons are successful, it returns `True`, indicating that the BlockManagers are equal.

By implementing this corrected version of the function, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
