The buggy function `equals` is a method within the pandas library's `managers.py` file. This function is designed to compare two pandas data structures to check for equality. 

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` within the `test_internals.py` file is comparing two dataframes that have different values but the same column names. It is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False` but is failing to do so.

The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` statement is failing because it is returning `True` instead of `False`. 

The bug in the `equals` function is likely occurring in the comparison of the dataframe blocks. When comparing the blocks for equality, the function is not properly handling the scenario where the column values are different but the column names are the same.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the comparison of dataframes where the column names are the same but the values are different.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on column names to ensure proper comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: list(x.items()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: list(x.items()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should handle the comparison of dataframes with the same column names but different values correctly, and the failing test should now pass.
