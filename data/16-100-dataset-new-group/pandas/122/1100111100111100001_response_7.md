The bug in the provided function `equals` is causing the test to fail with the error message `assert True is False`. This indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. 

The bug is likely in the way the function is comparing the self.blocks and other.blocks. The function tries to order the blocks based on their data type and manager locations, but it is not handling the case where the blocks have different data types in an appropriate manner.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of block data types is done correctly and consistently. We also need to handle the case where the blocks have a different number of entries. 

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we convert the data type of the block to a string when comparing and sorting the blocks. This ensures a consistent comparison regardless of the specific data type. Additionally, we now handle the case where the blocks have different numbers of entries, which was previously causing the comparison to fail. This should fix the bug and make the function work as intended.
