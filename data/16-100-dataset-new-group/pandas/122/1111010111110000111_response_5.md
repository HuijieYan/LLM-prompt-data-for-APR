The issue arises from the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The issue is that the `equals` method doesn't correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is evident from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`, which compares two DataFrames that are not equal but the `equals` method incorrectly returns True instead of False.

The error message from the failing test shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails with the error `assert True is False`.

The GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" provides a clear description of the problem and an expected output.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should properly handle the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. Specifically, it should not return True if the blocks have different locations.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks
        # (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        # Compare blocks pairwise and their locations
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) and (block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs))
            for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method now compares not only the blocks themselves but also their locations, ensuring that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are correctly identified as not equal. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
