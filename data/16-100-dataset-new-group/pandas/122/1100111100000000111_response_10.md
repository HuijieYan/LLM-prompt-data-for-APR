The bug in the provided function is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to return True even when the blocks in the dataframe have different locations. This is leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect output for the users.

The cause of this bug lies in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function. This function is intended to provide a key for sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. However, due to the presence of a similarly named function outside the class, the intended `canonicalize` function from the class is not being used, leading to incorrect comparison and sorting of blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the `canonicalize` function that is defined outside the class and ensure that the `canonicalize` function defined within the `BlockManager` class is being used for sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other class methods...

    # this is the fixed version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):  # defining the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By making sure that the `canonicalize` function is defined within the `BlockManager` class and removing any similar functions with the same name outside the class, we can ensure that the correct function is being used for sorting the blocks. This should resolve the bug and make the `DataFrame.equals()` method behave as expected.
