After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code, and the GitHub issue, we can identify the potential error location in the `equals` function. The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the dataframe blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now correctly generates a tuple using block `dtype` and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, the `as_array` method is called correctly to convert the `mgr_locs` to an array.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
