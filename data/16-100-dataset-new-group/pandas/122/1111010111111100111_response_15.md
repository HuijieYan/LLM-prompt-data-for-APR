The issue seems to be caused by the `equals` method returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The potential error locations within the `equals` method are:
1. The comparison of block locations without considering whether the blocks are consolidated or not.
2. The sorting of blocks based on a canonical form without considering the block's actual values.

The buggy function is comparing the blocks of the `self` and `other` BlockManager objects without considering the possibility of unconsolidated blocks, which results in an incorrect comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to account for potential unconsolidated blocks. We can achieve this by ensuring that the blocks are consolidated before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    self_blocks = [b.consolidate() for b in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [b.consolidate() for b in other.blocks]
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` function first consolidates the blocks before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the actual values of the blocks rather than their locations.

By making this change, the `equals` method should now return the correct result and pass the failing test.
