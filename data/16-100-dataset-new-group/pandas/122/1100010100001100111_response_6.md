The issue is related to the `DataFrame.equals()` function returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The buggy function `equals()` compares two BlockManager objects. The bug seems to be related to not properly handling the comparison of blocks with different locations.

The function compares the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, and if they are not equal, it returns False. Then it compares the elements of `self_axes` and `other_axes` using the `.equals()` method, and if any of them are not equal, it returns False. Then it consolidates the blocks of `self` and `other` inplace, and if their lengths are not equal, it returns False. Finally, it sorts the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using a custom `canonicalize()` function and compares each pair of blocks, returning False if any pair is not equal.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison process to properly handle the case of identical blocks with different locations. We can modify the `canonicalize()` function to include more information about the block locations to ensure that identical blocks are not wrongly considered as different due to their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we modify the `canonicalize()` function to include the block values along with the block type and mgr_locs. This ensures that blocks with identical values and different locations are not considered different.

This change should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue, ensuring that the `equals()` function returns the expected result for identical blocks with different locations.
