The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class does not properly compare the dataframes `df1` and `df2`. The issue stems from the fact that when comparing the blocks of the two dataframes, the comparison fails to account for different block locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to properly compare the blocks of the dataframes, accounting for potential differences in block locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_frame().to_numpy().tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations and converting block locations to bytes, we ensure that block locations are accounted for in the comparison. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test.
