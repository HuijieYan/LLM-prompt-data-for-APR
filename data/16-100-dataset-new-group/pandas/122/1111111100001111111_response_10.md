To fix the bug in the 'equals' function, we need to correct the canonicalization of block order and comparison between the blocks. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are sorted using a canonicalization function that combines the type name and the location of the blocks. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not erroneously considered equal. The comparison between the blocks has also been updated to compare their equality using the 'equals' method.

By making these corrections, we ensure that the 'equals' function behaves as expected and returns the correct result, resolving the issue reported on GitHub regarding the wrong return value of the `equals` function for identical blocks with different locations.
