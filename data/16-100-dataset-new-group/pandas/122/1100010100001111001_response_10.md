It looks like the buggy function `equals` is comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` incorrectly. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` seems to be working fine. However, when comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, it fails to sort the blocks correctly and compare them in the right order. This results in incorrect comparisons and leads to a false return value.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to correctly sort the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their type and `mgr_locs`. Then, we can compare the sorted blocks in the correct order.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now properly sorts the blocks based on their type and `mgr_locs`. Then, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are correctly sorted before being compared, leading to the correct return value based on the comparison.
