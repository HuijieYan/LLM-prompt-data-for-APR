### Explanation
The bug occurs when the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` for two DataFrames that are not equal. This is due to the comparison of the block locations, which are not properly handled by the `equals` function. 

The function first checks the length of the axes of the two DataFrames, and if they are not equal, it returns `False`. Then, it checks if all the axes elements are equal, and if not, it also returns `False`. After that, it consolidates the DataFrames and compares the length of the blocks. If the length of the blocks is not equal, it returns `False`. 

However, the bug occurs when it sorts the blocks based on their data type name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting operation does not properly handle the comparison of block locations, which causes the incorrect result.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of block locations is handled correctly. One possible way to achieve this is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations in a way that accurately represents their equality. Additionally, we should ensure that the sorting operation considers the block locations to avoid the incorrect comparison.

### The corrected version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the block data to ensure accurate comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block._get_values().tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function includes the block data along with the type name to ensure accurate comparison. This should address the issue where the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` for two DataFrames that are not equal.
