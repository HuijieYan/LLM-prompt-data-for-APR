The bug in the `BlockManager` class's `equals` method causes it to wrongly return `True` when comparing two dataframes with identical blocks but different locations. This can be seen from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`, which compares two dataframes `df1` and `df2` and expects the result of `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False` due to the dataframes having different values in the same locations. However, the test fails with the error `assert True is False`.

The cause of the bug is in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. It does not properly handle the comparison of blocks with identical data but different locations, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method can be updated by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's data, rather than just the type name and locations, in order to properly compare the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method should now correctly handle the comparison of blocks with identical data but different locations, and the failing test should pass, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
