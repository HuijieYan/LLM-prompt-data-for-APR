The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return False for two DataFrame objects that are actually equal. The bug seems to be in the sorting of the blocks before the final comparison. 

The bug happens because the `canonicalize` function is returning a tuple with a list inside, and then that list is being transformed into a numpy array. This causes the comparison to fail even if the underlying data is the same. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to return the `mgr_locs` list directly, without converting it to a numpy array. This will allow for a proper comparison of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return True for the failing test case.
