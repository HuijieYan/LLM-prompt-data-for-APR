The issue stated that the DataFrame.equals() method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. The expected output for the provided test is False, but the actual output is likely True, indicating a bug in the equals() method.

Looking at the code, the bug may be related to the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks. It seems that the sorting logic might not be correctly handling blocks with different locations but identical content.

To fix the bug, we can revise the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks to consider both block content and locations. This can be achieved by creating a tuple of (block content, block location) and using it as the key for sorting.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the canonicalize function now creates a tuple of (block content, block location) to be used as keys for sorting self_blocks and other_blocks. This modification should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
