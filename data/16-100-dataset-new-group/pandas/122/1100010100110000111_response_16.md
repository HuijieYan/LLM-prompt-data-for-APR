## Analysis
The error message indicates that the equals method of the DataFrame is returning True when it should be returning False.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the equals method is not working as expected and should return False.

The buggy function is comparing the blocks of two DataFrames to check for equality, but it is improperly returning True instead of False when the blocks are not equal.

## Identification of potential error locations
- The issue might arise from the sorting of blocks and comparing the sorted blocks to see if they are equal. 

## Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function, used for sorting the blocks, is not effective in distinguishing between identical blocks with different locations. This leads to the comparison returning True when it should actually be False.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Implement a better way to compare the blocks of the two DataFrames, taking into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.
2. Use a different approach for sorting or comparing the blocks to ensure that the equality comparison returns the correct result.

## Implementation of the corrected function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks.flatten()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.flatten()
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function no longer utilizes the sorting and canonicalization of blocks, which caused the incorrect behavior. Instead, it directly flattens the blocks and compares them. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are properly compared and the correct result is returned.
