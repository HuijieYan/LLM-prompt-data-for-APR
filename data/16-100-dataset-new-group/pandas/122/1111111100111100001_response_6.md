The bug in the given function is likely caused by a problem with the block sorting logic. It seems that the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks is not working correctly, causing the equality check to fail.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks is done correctly so that the equality check can produce the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks is explicitly defined using a custom sorting key, ensuring that the comparison is done in the expected order and the equality check should now produce the correct result.
