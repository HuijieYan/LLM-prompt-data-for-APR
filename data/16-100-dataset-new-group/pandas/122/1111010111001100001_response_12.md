The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the `self` and `other` objects. The comparison is based on the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs` (manager locations) of each block, but the current implementation is not producing the expected results.

The bug is likely in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to create a canonicalized representation of the block for comparison. The bug could be due to the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function or how it is being used to compare blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function produces a correct and consistent representation of the blocks, and use it properly in the comparison of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, the `canonicalize` function converts the block's dtype to a string and uses `mgr_locs` directly. This should produce a more accurate and consistent representation for comparison.

This corrected version addresses the issue of block comparison in the `equals` function and should now pass the failing test.
