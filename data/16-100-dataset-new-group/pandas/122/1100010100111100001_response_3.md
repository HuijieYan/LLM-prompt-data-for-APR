The bug in the provided function `equals` is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail, as indicated by the error message. The error message is `E assert True is False`, which means that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The potential error locations within the function are the conditionals and the sorting and comparing of blocks.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly comparing the self and other dataframes. It is returning `True` when the dataframes are not equal.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly compare the dataframes by their axes and blocks, and return `False` if they are not equal.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the failing test should pass, as the function now properly compares the dataframes and returns the correct result.
