## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals()` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the bug occurs because the function incorrectly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This happens because the function fails to properly sort and compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects are properly canonicalized and sorted before comparison. This involves adjusting the `canonicalize` function to properly define block order based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, the function needs to re-sort both sets of blocks before comparing them. 

## Code Fix
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    # Sort both sets of blocks using the canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
