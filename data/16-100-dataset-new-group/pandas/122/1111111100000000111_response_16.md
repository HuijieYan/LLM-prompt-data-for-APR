To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue described in the GitHub problem description. The problem is that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. 

The cause of the bug lies within the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The function compares blocks using the `canonicalize` method to sort the blocks and then compare them using the `equals` method. However, if identical blocks are located in different positions, the comparison would fail. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison process in a way that it takes into account both the values and the positions of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks using both values and positions
    for i, (block1, block2) in enumerate(zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        if not block1.equals(block2) or block1.mgr_locs.tolist() != block2.mgr_locs.tolist():
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of blocks now includes checking both the values and the positions (mgr_locs) of the blocks. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations will not wrongly return True when using the `equals` function.
