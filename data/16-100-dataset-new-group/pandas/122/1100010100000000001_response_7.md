### Analyzing the buggy function:

The function `equals()` is comparing two objects (`self` and `other`) and returning `False` if they are not equal. It compares the axes, consolidates the objects, and then compares the blocks in a sorted order.

### Potential error locations:

1. The comparison of axes may not be accurate.
2. The consolidation process may not be working as intended.
3. Sorting and comparing the blocks may not be correct.
4. There might be issues with the way the `equals()` method is being used for the blocks.

### Explanation of the bug:

The bug may occur due to incorrect comparison of axes, flawed consolidation, improper sorting of blocks, or incorrect usage of the `equals()` method for blocks. These potential errors can lead to the function returning `False` even when the objects should be considered equal.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the comparison of axes is accurate and considers all relevant attributes of the axes.
2. Verify that the consolidation process is correctly working for both `self` and `other` objects.
3. Double-check the sorting of blocks to ensure it is consistent and based on the correct criteria.
4. Validate the usage of the `equals()` method for comparing the blocks.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values.strides, block._values.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```
In the corrected version, the comparison of axes is done using a loop to check each pair of axes. The consolidation process, sorting of blocks, and the usage of `equals()` for comparisons have also been adjusted. These changes should help to fix the bug in the `equals()` function.
