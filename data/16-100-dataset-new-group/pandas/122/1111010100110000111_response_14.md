### Error Analysis and Bug Explanation:

The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not handling the comparison of the dataframe blocks correctly, leading to incorrect results when calling `DataFrame.equals()` method. This causes the test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` to fail and return `True` instead of `False`.

The main problem arises when sorting and comparing the block arrays. It appears that the bug stems from the comparison of the blocks in a way that does not account for their correct order or location.

The error message provided by the failing test shows that the `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True` instead of `False`, which is not the expected behavior. This highlights the issue with the comparison logic in the `equals` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks needs to be corrected in the `equals` function. Additionally, proper handling of the block order and location should be implemented to ensure the correct comparison and equality check.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on index labels and check for equality
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x.items())))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x.items())))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The modified version of the function now properly sorts the block arrays based on their index labels using the `hash(tuple(x.items()))` function. This ensures that the comparison of the blocks is done in a consistent and correct order.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should address the bug and ensure that the failing test passes, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
