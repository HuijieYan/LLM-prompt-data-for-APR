The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class to check if they are equal. 

The bug in the function is likely occurring in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparison. The sorting logic might not be correct, leading to the wrong comparison results.

The failing test is `test_dataframe_not_equal`, which compares two dataframes `df1` and `df2`. The expected outcome in the failing test is that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it returns `True`, which causes the assertion error.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect sorting logic within the `equals` function, leading to the wrong comparison results.

To fix the bug, the sorting logic within the `canonicalize` function needs to be corrected to ensure that blocks are sorted in a way that guarantees the correct comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().tostring(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The sorting logic within the `canonicalize` function has been updated to ensure correct sorting based on the block values and locations. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
