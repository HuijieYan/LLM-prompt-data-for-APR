The bug in the provided function `equals` appears to be caused by an issue with comparing the DataFrame objects `self` and `other`. The error message indicates that it is failing to correctly compare the two dataframes.

The `equals` function first compares the lengths of the index axes of both dataframes. Then it proceeds to compare the axes using the `equals` method, followed by some operations on the data blocks. The error message indicates that the actual comparison is resulting in `True` instead of `False`, which is incorrect.

The bug might be caused by incorrect comparison of the axes or issues with the data blocks comparison.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the dataframes should be adjusted, ensuring that both the index axes and the data blocks are compared correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for s_block, o_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not s_block.equals(o_block):
            return False
            
    return True
```

This corrected version first checks the axes for equality, then consolidates the dataframes, and finally compares the data blocks individually to ensure correct comparison of the dataframes. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as expected.
