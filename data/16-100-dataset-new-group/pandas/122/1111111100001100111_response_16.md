The bug in the equals() function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with different locations but identical content. When comparing the blocks, the equals() function does not consider the block locations, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can modify the canonicalize() function to include the block locations when sorting the blocks. Additionally, we need to account for the block locations when comparing the blocks in the final return statement.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and block content including locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the equals() function should now correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations but identical content, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
