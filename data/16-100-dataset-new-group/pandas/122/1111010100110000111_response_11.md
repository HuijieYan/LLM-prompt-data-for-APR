The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is causing an issue when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This results in the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail, even though it is expected to return `False`. 

The issue arises because the function is using `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to compare the blocks in the DataFrames, but when the blocks are identical, and only their location is different, the comparison incorrectly returns `True`. This is due to the block order not being canonicalized when comparing the DataFrames.

To fix this issue, a strategy would be to introduce canonicalization of block order when comparing the DataFrames. This could involve sorting the blocks based on their type name and their manager locations before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # compare the canonicalized block order
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the comparison of `df1.equals(df2)` will now return `False` as expected, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
