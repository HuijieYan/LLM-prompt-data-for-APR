### Bug Explanation

The `equals` function is intended to compare two BlockManager instances and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` if they are not. However, the current implementation of the function is leading to unexpected behavior, as seen in the failing test case.

The failing test case involves comparing two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`. The expected result is that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal. However, the test is currently failing with the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` returning `assert True is False`, which signifies that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should not be.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The comparison method is not handling the blocks' order and locations correctly, leading to incorrect results being returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` needs to be revised so that it accounts for the blocks' order and locations. Additionally, any sorting or canonicalizing of the blocks should also consider their types and locations to ensure that the comparison is accurate.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    # also consider the block locations in the canonicalization
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` function now sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and locations when performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
