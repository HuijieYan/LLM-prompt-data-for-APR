The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the function to return `True` incorrectly when it should be returning `False`. This is leading to failing tests, as demonstrated by the provided error message and runtime input/output variable values.

The cause of the bug is related to the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. Due to incorrect comparison logic, the function is incorrectly identifying the DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` as equal, when in fact they are not. This is leading to a failed assertion and incorrect behavior.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the comparison logic for the blocks is correct, such that the `equals` function correctly identifies when two DataFrames are unequal and returns `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    
    # Sort the blocks based on their content, and compare the sorted lists
    return sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda x: x.values).equals(sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda x: x.values))
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content and then comparing the sorted lists, this corrected version of the function should now correctly identify when two DataFrames are equal or not equal. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test passes.
