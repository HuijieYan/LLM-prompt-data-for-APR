The `equals` function contains a bug due to the incorrect comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function tries to canonicalize the block order, but the order of the blocks themselves is not being compared correctly.

The blocks need to be sorted based on their type and manager locations, so a `canonicalize` function was used to correctly compare and sort the blocks. The bug is likely due to the sorting process in the `canonicalize` function not considering the block manager locations.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to return a tuple that includes both the block type and its manager locations for comparison and sorting.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name)  # Include mgr_locs in the comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple with the manager locations and the block type, which ensures that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected output for the given test cases.
