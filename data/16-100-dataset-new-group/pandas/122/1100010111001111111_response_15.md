The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is a problem identified in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The bug occurs due to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on block type and locations (mgr_locs). However, if the blocks have the same type and content but different locations, they should not be considered equal, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the sorting process should be updated to include a method of differentiating blocks based on their locations, ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are not considered equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Update canonicalize function to also consider block locations
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare DataFrames based on block content and locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
