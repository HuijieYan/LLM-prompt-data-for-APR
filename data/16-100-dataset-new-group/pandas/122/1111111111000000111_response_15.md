### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class has an issue with comparing the equality of two DataFrames. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates the problem where two DataFrames with the same data but different locations for the same values are erroneously considered equal by the `equals` function.

The GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" further highlights the problem and provides a code sample that fails the test case.

The buggy function attempts to compare blocks of the DataFrame for equality, and it uses the `equals` method to do so. However, due to the different locations of the blocks, the comparison incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located within the `equals` function where the block comparison is being performed. The comparison logic does not account for the different block locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `equals` function not properly considering the block locations and assuming that identical blocks are in the same order in both DataFrames.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be modified to properly handle the comparison of block locations. The comparison logic should treat identical blocks with different locations as unequal.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values._data, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a new `canonicalize` function is used that considers both the values and the data location of the blocks. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case while addressing the GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".
