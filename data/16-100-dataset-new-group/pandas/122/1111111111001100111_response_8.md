The issue with the buggy function is that it is mistakenly returning True for `df3.equals(df4)` when it should actually return False. This is because the canonicalization of block order is not consistent and causes the comparison to be incorrect.

To resolve this issue, the canonicalization of block order should be updated to ensure consistency when comparing blocks. Additionally, the comparison logic could be improved to handle different block orders correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# imports
import pandas as pd

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other class methods and attributes
    
    # corrected equals function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize the blocks
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.to_numpy().tolist())
        
        # sort the blocks based on canonicalization
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # compare sorted blocks
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By updating the canonicalization of blocks and their comparison logic, the corrected function should now return False for `df3.equals(df4)`, as expected. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
