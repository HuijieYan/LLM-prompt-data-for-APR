The bug in the `equals` function is caused by sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, but the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, in the class and outside the class. This causes ambiguity and potentially leads to the wrong function being referenced. 

To fix the bug, remove the `canonicalize` function from the class and ensure that the correct `canonicalize` function is being referenced when sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Only one canonicalize function is defined outside the class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # Fixed the function call here

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By addressing the issue of ambiguous function calls, this corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
