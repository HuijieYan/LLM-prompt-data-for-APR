## The corrected version of the function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.mgr_locs.as_array.equals(oblock.mgr_locs.as_array)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
1. The corrected version addresses the issue with incorrectly returning True when comparing identical blocks with different locations by modifying the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple including both the block values and the manager locations.
2. Then, in the return statement, we compare the block values and manager locations separately using the `values` attribute and the `mgr_locs.as_array` attribute to ensure both the values and locations are identical.
3. This updated approach ensures that the equality check accounts for both the block values and their locations, resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case and return the expected value (`False`) for the provided test, as well as resolving the issue presented on GitHub.
