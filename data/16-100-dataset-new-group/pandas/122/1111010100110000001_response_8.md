The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances and determine if they are equal. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it is expected to be `False`.

An analysis of the `equals` function shows that it is attempting to compare the internal blocks of the two instances. The bug might be arising from the comparison of the blocks, specifically the order of the blocks being compared.

The cause of the bug is likely that the comparison is not properly accounting for the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The function sorts the blocks using a custom function `canonicalize`, but it is not guaranteed that this sorting will result in a correct comparison between the two instances.

To fix the bug, the comparison must also take into account the order or position of the blocks within each instance. Sorting the blocks alone may not be sufficient, so it may be necessary to use a different method to compare the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, the comparison now directly iterates through the blocks of each instance and compares them individually, ensuring that the order and content of the blocks are considered when determining equality.
