The bug in the equals function is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of the axes of two dataframes. It seems that the comparison between the axes of self and other dataframes is failing, which then leads to the function returning incorrectly. The comparison between the blocks of the two dataframes is also incorrect.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the axes of the two dataframes should be fixed, and the sorting and comparison of the blocks should also be corrected. Additionally, it is noted that there is a nested function `canonicalize` defined twice in the BlockManager class, but it is not being used properly.

The corrected version of the equals function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    for axis in [0, 1]:
        self_blocks = self.get_axis(axis)
        other_blocks = other.get_axis(axis)
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        self.blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values._typ, block.mgr_locs))
        other.blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values._typ, block.mgr_locs))
        if not all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
            return False
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly compare the axes and blocks of the two dataframes and return the expected result.
