The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal. The function first checks if the axes of the two objects are equal in length and have the same labels. Then it consolidates the block manager inplace and compares the blocks within the two managers to check for equality.

The problem in the buggy function lies in the comparison of the block managers' blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations. However, the comparison is incorrect as it compares the sorted self blocks with the sorted other blocks without considering the block type and content, resulting in a false comparison.

To fix the bug, instead of sorting and comparing the block managers based on the type name and locations, we should compare the blocks directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the comparison of the blocks directly ensures that the equality check is performed accurately.

After applying this fix, the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without raising an AssertionError.
