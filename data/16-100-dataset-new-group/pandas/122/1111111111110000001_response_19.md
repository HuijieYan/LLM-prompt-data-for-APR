The bug in the code is that the `equals` method is not implemented correctly in the `BlockManager` class. The method should check the equality of two `BlockManager` objects, but the comparison logic is flawed.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not checking for the equality of the actual data within the `BlockManager` objects. Instead, it is using a sorting mechanism to compare the internal blocks of the objects, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to directly compare the data within the `BlockManager` objects using the `values` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False
    
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
        
    return (self.values == other.values).all()
```

By directly comparing the `values` attribute of the `BlockManager` objects, we ensure that the actual data within the objects is being compared for equality.

This corrected version of the `equals` method should pass the failing test.
