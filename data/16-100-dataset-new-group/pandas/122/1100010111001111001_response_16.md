The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is not reliable due to the sorting by `canonicalize` function. The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the sorting process in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that the correct comparison is made between the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_slice(), block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `type(block)`, `block.mgr_locs.as_slice()`, and `block.values.tobytes()` as the keys in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their type, location, and values, which provides a more robust comparison. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
