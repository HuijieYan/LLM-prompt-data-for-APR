The buggy function "equals" compares two BlockManager objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. It then attempts to canonicalize the order of the blocks using a sorting mechanism before finally comparing the blocks for equality.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of axes' lengths might be incorrect.
2. The call to `_consolidate_inplace()` may not be working as intended.
3. The sorting and canonicalization of blocks may not be accurate.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison and sorting of the blocks, which is not producing the correct result when checking for equality between two BlockManager objects.

To fix the bug, we can take the following approach:
1. Validate the comparison of the axes' lengths to ensure it accurately represents the equality of the BlockManager objects.
2. Verify that the call to `_consolidate_inplace()` performs the necessary consolidation as intended.
3. Review the sorting and canonicalization of blocks to ensure that it reflects the equality comparison accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version provided above, the failing test should pass now.

```python
def test_dataframe_not_equal():
    # see GH28839
    df1 = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"]})
    df2 = pd.DataFrame({"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]})
    assert df1.equals(df2) is False
```
