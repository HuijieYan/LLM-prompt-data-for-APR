The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This bug has been reported in a GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The issue arises from the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The function attempts to canonicalize block order using a combination of the dtype name and mgr_locs, which might not be unique for blocks with the same data in different locations. This causes the comparison to fail and leads to an incorrect return value.

To fix this bug, the canonicalization strategy needs to be improved to account for identical blocks in different locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, data, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function considers the block values in addition to dtype and mgr_locs when canonicalizing block order. This ensures that identical blocks in different locations will be correctly distinguished and compared, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
