The bug in the given function is likely in the 'canonicalize' function, where the 'block.dtype.name' attribute may not be correctly identifying the data types. This could cause the 'canonicalize' function to incorrectly sort the blocks, leading to a false comparison in the return statement.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'canonicalize' function to ensure it correctly identifies the data types of the blocks. We can achieve this by accessing the 'dtype' attribute of the blocks and then converting it to a string to match the expected type for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the 'canonicalize' function to use 'str(block.dtype)' instead of 'block.dtype.name', we ensure that the data types of the blocks are correctly identified for comparison. This should fix the bug and allow the function to return the correct comparison result for the given input variables and values.
