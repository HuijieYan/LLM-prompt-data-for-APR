## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without handling the case where they might be of different lengths.
2. The sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which may not giving the expected result.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not handle the case where `self_axes` and `other_axes` might be of different lengths. Additionally, the sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function may not correctly distinguish between identical blocks with different locations.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Handle the case where `self_axes` and `other_axes` might be of different lengths in the comparison.
2. Improve the `canonicalize` function to correctly distinguish between blocks with different locations.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(blocks):
        result = {}
        for block in blocks:
            dtype_name = block.dtype.name
            mgr_locs = tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
            result[(dtype_name, mgr_locs)] = block
        return result

    self_canonicalized = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_canonicalized = canonicalize(other.blocks)

    return self_canonicalized == other_canonicalized
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function now correctly handles the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` as well as the sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the improved `canonicalize` function.

With this corrected version, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
