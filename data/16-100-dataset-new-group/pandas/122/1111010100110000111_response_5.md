The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not handling the comparison of DataFrame blocks correctly. This is leading to the method returning True even when the blocks have different locations but identical values. This behavior is not as expected, and it is causing a failing test case.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be updated to handle the comparison of DataFrame blocks based on their values and locations accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # compare blocks based on values and locations
        for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
            if not block.index.equals(other.blocks[i].index):
                return False
            if not block.columns.equals(other.blocks[i].columns):
                return False
            if not block.values.equals(other.blocks[i].values):
                return False

        return True
```

In the corrected version, we are explicitly comparing the index, columns, and values of the blocks to ensure that they are truly equal. This updated version should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and pass the failing test.
