## Correction:

The bug in the function `equals` is causing it to return `True` when it should be returning `False` for the specific case provided in the failing test.

The issue arises from the comparison being made using the `equals` method between `df1` and `df2` in the failing test. The `equals` method is wrongly returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the test failure.

The cause of the bug lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function. The function does not properly compare the dataframes when they have identical blocks with different locations. This results in an incorrect `True` value being returned when it should be `False`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to account for the different block locations.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.to_int_indexer().tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
Please note the modifications made to the `canonicalize` function and the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. These changes account for the different block locations and enable a proper comparison.

After applying these changes, the `equals` function should return the correct result for the failing test case, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
