The buggy function `equals` in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is not correctly comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. This is evident from the error message stating `assert True is False`, which indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two different DataFrames. Additionally, the GitHub issue further confirms that the function is returning an incorrect result.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the block comparison and canonicalization process using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is using a canonicalization process for block order, but this process is not accurately identifying different blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects when they have different locations. As a result, the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` for DataFrames that should be considered unequal.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization process should be improved to properly sort and compare the blocks based on their content, including handling cases where the block locations are different.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Compare the length of blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order and compare based on content
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been removed, and the comparison of blocks has been improved to directly compare the content of the blocks for equality.

By using the corrected version of the `equals` function, the bug should be resolved as it now properly compares the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects and returns the correct result for DataFrame equality. This should also address the issue reported on GitHub.
