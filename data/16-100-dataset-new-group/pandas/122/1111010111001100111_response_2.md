The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. However, it fails to do so when the blocks have identical content but different locations. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`, as demonstrated by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The bug occurs because the function sorts the blocks using a custom key function `canonicalize`, which combines the block's data type name and the block's manager locations. In cases where the block content is identical but the manager locations differ, the function incorrectly considers them equal.

To fix the bug, the custom key function `canonicalize` needs to be modified to consider only the block's content for comparison, ignoring the manager locations. Once this change is made, the function will correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances based solely on their contents.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, considering only the block's content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function will accurately determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances by comparing the content of their blocks, resolving the issue posted on GitHub and ensuring that the provided failing test now passes.
