## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code, and the GitHub issue:
The buggy function is the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The buggy function is called when trying to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The issue reported on GitHub is that the `equals` method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is not the expected behavior.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The canonicalization of block order using the `canonicalize` function could be causing the comparison to fail.
2. The comparison of the blocks might not be taking into account the block locations.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort and compare the blocks may not be accurately capturing the differences in block locations, leading to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` method properly accounts for the block locations when comparing two DataFrames.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if self.blocks.keys() != other.blocks.keys():
        return False

    for block_loc in self.blocks:
        if not self.blocks[block_loc].equals(other.blocks.get(block_loc, None)):
            return False

    return True
```
In the corrected version of the `equals` method, we compare the block locations directly and ensure that the equality check is performed on each block individually.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
