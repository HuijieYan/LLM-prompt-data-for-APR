The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` method used for sorting the blocks is not correctly comparing the blocks' values, leading to an incorrect comparison result. This causes the `equals` method to return `True` instead of `False`, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to accurately compare the blocks based on their values, ensuring that blocks with different locations but identical values are recognized as not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass, and the bug described in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
