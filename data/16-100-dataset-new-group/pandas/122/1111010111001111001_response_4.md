Based on the runtime and expected variable values, it appears that the `equals` function is not properly handling the comparison of blocks within a `BlockManager`. 

The bug seems to be related to the way in which the block order is being canonicalized, which affects the equality comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. 

Furthermore, the expected values and types indicate that the `block.mgr_locs` is an important part of the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be adjusted to include `mgr_locs` in a format that can be compared and that correctly reflects the expected values and types. Additionally, the block equality comparison should be further investigated to ensure it properly compares the blocks.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes `block.mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function and uses `as_slice()` and `mgr_locs` to properly compare the block order, aligning it with the expected values and types.
