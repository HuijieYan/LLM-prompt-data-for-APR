The issue with the `equals` function is that it incorrectly compares two DataFrames for equality. The function fails to properly compare the values within the DataFrames, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `equals` function to compare the values within the DataFrames instead of simply comparing the axes and blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        return False
    
    # Check if the axes are equal
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    
    # Check if the shape of the blocks is the same
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if the values within the blocks are equal
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly compares the values within the DataFrames for equality. It first checks if the axes are equal, then checks the shape of the blocks, and finally compares the values within the blocks to determine equality.

This should address the bug and fix the failing test case.
