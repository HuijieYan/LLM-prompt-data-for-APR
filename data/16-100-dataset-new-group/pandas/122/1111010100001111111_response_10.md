def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype.name), str(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

## Justification for the corrected version
The bug in the original equals() function arises from the comparison of block locations in the self and other BlockManager objects. The original function fails to properly compare the block locations, resulting in incorrect equality checks for DataFrames, as observed in the GitHub issue.

The corrected version addresses this issue by explicitly converting the dtype.name and block.mgr_locs.as_array to strings within the canonicalize function. This ensures consistent string representations for comparing block locations. By sorting and comparing the self and other blocks using canonicalize, the corrected function accurately checks for the equality of block locations, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
