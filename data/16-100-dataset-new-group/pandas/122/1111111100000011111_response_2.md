The potential error in the buggy function is the comparison logic for the blocks. It seems that the buggy function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This is confirmed by the GitHub issue, where the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returns `True` in this specific case.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the blocks should be updated to consider the identical blocks with different locations as unequal, which should return `False` as the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and its `mgr_locs` as a tuple, to correctly distinguish between blocks with identical content but different locations. Additionally, the len() comparison is used to check if the number of blocks in the self and other objects are different, and if so, it returns `False`.

With this correction, the function should now correctly return `False` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
