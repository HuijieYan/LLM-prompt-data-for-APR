The buggy function fails to sort the blocks in the correct order before comparing them. This causes the failing test case because the order of the blocks is not taken into consideration when comparing the dataframes.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a consistent order before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions)

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # ensure consistent ordering before comparison
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs))

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the function will sort the blocks based on their type and `mgr_locs` before comparing them, ensuring a consistent comparison of the dataframes.
