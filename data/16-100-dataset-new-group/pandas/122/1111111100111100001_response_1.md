The bug in the provided function `equals` is likely related to the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. It is causing the comparison to fail, resulting in the assertion error shown in the failing test message.

The buggy function attempts to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class by sorting their blocks and then comparing each block for equality. However, the sorting logic using the `canonicalize` function is flawed, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, it is essential to correct the sorting logic and the comparison of the blocks to ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances is performed correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# Import the necessary package
import pandas as pd

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks based on their dmgr_locs properties
    def sort_blocks_by_mgr_locs(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks_by_mgr_locs(self.blocks)
    other_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks_by_mgr_locs(other.blocks)
    
    # Compare each block for equality
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted))
```

With the corrected logic, the function should now properly compare the two `BlockManager` instances and return the correct result, resolving the failing test.
