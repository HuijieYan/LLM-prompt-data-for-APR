To fix the bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, we need to ensure that the comparison logic correctly identifies whether two BlockManagers are equal. Based on the provided input/output values, we can see that the comparison logic is flawed because it's not properly comparing the contents of the blocks within the BlockManager.

The issue mentioned in the GitHub post states that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This reflects the incorrect behavior of the comparison logic.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` method to compare the contents of the blocks within the BlockManager. To achieve this, we can iterate through each block in both self.blocks and other.blocks and compare their contents to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the contents of each block
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should now accurately compare the BlockManagers and return the correct result based on the content of their blocks. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the method passes the failing test.
