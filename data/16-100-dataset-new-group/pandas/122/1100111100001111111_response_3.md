Based on the provided information and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `equals` function arises from incorrect comparison of blocks with different locations. The `equals` function assumes that blocks with the same content in different locations are not equal, leading to incorrect results. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to account for the possibility of blocks with the same content in different locations being equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # adjust canonicalize to consider block values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)  # compare block values instead of block itself
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` function now compares the values of blocks using the `equals` method, rather than directly comparing the blocks. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function has been adjusted to consider block values when determining equivalence.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected, returning `False` for the given test case.
