The buggy function fails to correctly identify when two DataFrames are not equal. This is due to the incorrect comparison logic within the `equals` function. The comparison logic currently fails to handle the comparison of the data within the DataFrames correctly, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for comparing the content of the DataFrames when the `equals` method is called. We should also ensure that the comparison handles different data types appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the comparison of the content within the DataFrames will be handled correctly, ensuring that the method returns the correct result for the given test cases.
