To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue with sorting and comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
1. The `canonicalize` function is used to create a unique identifier for each block based on its dtype and mgr_locs.
2. We then sort the blocks of both DataFrames using this unique identifier.
3. Finally, we compare the sorted blocks to check for equality.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug by correctly sorting and comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output.
