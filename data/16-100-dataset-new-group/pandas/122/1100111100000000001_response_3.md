The buggy function appears to be trying to compare two BlockManager objects to see if they are equal. The function seems to have several issues that could result in unexpected behavior.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The comparison of the length of the axes of the two BlockManager objects.
2. The comparison of each axis using the `equals` method.
3. The call to `_consolidate_inplace` on both `self` and `other`.
4. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function and then comparing the sorted blocks.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the way the blocks are being compared and sorted. Additionally, the use of the `_consolidate_inplace` method without proper context may be causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check if the axes of both BlockManager objects are equal in length before comparing each axis.
2. Use the `equals` method to compare the blocks instead of directly comparing them.
3. Ensure that the call to `_consolidate_inplace` is necessary and used in the correct context.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):  # Check if the lengths of the axes are equal
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):  # Compare each axis
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks using the equals method
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added comments to explain each step of the comparison process and used the `equals` method to compare the blocks. Additionally, we have kept the call to `_consolidate_inplace` as it seems necessary for the comparison.
