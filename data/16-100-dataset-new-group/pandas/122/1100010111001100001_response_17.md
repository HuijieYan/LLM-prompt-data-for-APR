The bug in the equals function is causing it to return False when it should actually return True. The bug is likely occurring in the `canonicalize` function, as it is used to sort the blocks before comparing them. 

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect sorting of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function, leading to a false comparison between the blocks. This is evident from the runtime values and types of variables, specifically the sorted self_blocks and other_blocks.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to appropriately sort the blocks based on their attributes so that the comparison between self_blocks and other_blocks returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
With this correction, the equals function should now return the correct result, passing the failing test.
