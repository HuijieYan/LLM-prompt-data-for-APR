The bug in the equals function is that it is not properly handling the comparison of blocks between two BlockManager objects. This is causing the failing test to return False when it should return True, indicating that the two DataFrames are equal.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the comparison of blocks between two BlockManager objects is done correctly. This may involve sorting the blocks and comparing them in a way that accounts for potential differences in block order and type.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks by type and mgr_locs to ensure a consistent comparison
    def sort_key(block):
        return (f"{type(block).__name__}:{block.dtype}", block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks using the `sort_key` function, we ensure that the comparison is done consistently, taking into account the block type and mgr_locs. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
