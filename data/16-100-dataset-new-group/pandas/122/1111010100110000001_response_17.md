The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality, but it has several bugs that need to be fixed.

Bug 1: The function is not properly comparing the content of the blocks or axes, leading to incorrect results and the AssertionError.

Bug 2: When the comparison fails, the function is not returning `False` as expected.

To fix these bugs, we need to:
1. Correctly compare the content of the blocks and axes.
2. Return `False` when the comparison fails.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, including the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying these changes, the function should now properly compare the content of the `BlockManager` instances and return `False` when the comparison fails. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
