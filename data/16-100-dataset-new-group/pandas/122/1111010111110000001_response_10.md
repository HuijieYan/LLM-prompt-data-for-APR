The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class. It is used to check if two instances of the `BlockManager` class are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two DataFrame instances (`df1` and `df2`) and checks if they are not equal using the `equals()` method. However, the test fails with an assertion error.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. The comparison of axes lengths may be incorrect.
2. The sorting and comparison of blocks might not be working as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals()` function for `BlockManager` does not compare the actual data within the blocks, but rather it compares the internal representation of the blocks. This leads to the incorrect comparison of the two DataFrames, resulting in a failing test.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the `equals()` method to compare the actual data within the blocks of `BlockManager` instances. This can be done by adding a step to compare the data within the blocks after sorting them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the data within the blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.values.equals(oblock.values):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now compares the actual block values and returns `True` if the values are equal, and `False` otherwise. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
