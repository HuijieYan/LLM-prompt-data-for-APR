The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in pandas/core/internals/managers.py. 

The error message from the failing test indicates that `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is evaluating to `True` instead of `False`. This indicates that the `equals` method is not working as expected.

Based on the runtime values provided, it seems that the core issue lies in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` method. The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks is not correctly identifying the differences between the blocks, leading to an incorrect comparison result.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly identifies the distinctions between the blocks, allowing for an accurate comparison.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the `type(block).__name__` to identify the type of each block, and includes the mgr_locs.as_array in the tuple to ensure unconsolidated blocks are distinguished correctly. This should result in an accurate comparison of the blocks and a successful execution of the failing test.
