The bug in the equals function is likely caused by an incorrect comparison of DataFrame objects. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two DataFrame objects to check for equality, but it does not account for the possibility of different data types in the columns. This is evident in the failing test function test_dataframe_not_equal, where two DataFrames with different column data types are mistakenly determined to be equal.

To fix the bug, the equals function should consider the data types of the columns in addition to the axes and blocks when comparing two DataFrame objects. This can be achieved by comparing the data types of the columns before comparing the values of the blocks.

Here's a corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    for col1, col2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if self[col1].dtype != other[col2].dtype:
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, before comparing the values of the blocks, the function iterates through the columns of the DataFrames and checks if the data types are equal. If any data types are not equal, the function returns False, indicating that the DataFrames are not equal. This additional check ensures that the function accurately determines the equality of the two DataFrames taking into account their data types.
