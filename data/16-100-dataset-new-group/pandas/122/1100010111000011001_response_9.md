The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two objects for equality. However, it contains potential error locations that may cause it to fail. The function starts by comparing the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`. If they are not of the same length, the function returns False. Then, it proceeds to compare each element of `self_axes` with the corresponding element of `other_axes`. If any of the comparisons returns False, the function also returns False. Next, the function consolidates the internal data structures of `self` and `other` in place. It then compares the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks of `self` and `other` based on their types and locations.

The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2`, which are not equal, and checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns False.

The potential cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are different but the corresponding elements are equal. This could lead to an incorrect comparison result.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle this case and return False if the lengths are different. Additionally, the comparison logic should be adjusted to account for potential differences in the internal data structures of `self` and `other`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
