The buggy function has an issue with comparing the blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. It sorts the blocks using a `canonicalize` function that depends on the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which might not be able to differentiate the blocks correctly in some cases.

To fix the bug, we can enhance the comparison logic for the blocks by directly comparing the blocks based on their dtype and values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly based on dtype and values
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    return True
```

By directly comparing the blocks based on their dtype and values, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies whether the `self` and `other` objects are equal.
