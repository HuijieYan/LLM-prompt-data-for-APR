The issue arises from the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class, which incorrectly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations. This is indicated by the failing test case provided in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` after consolidating them may not properly handle blocks with different locations.
2. The `canonicalize` function may not properly differentiate blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug is the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` after consolidating them, which may incorrectly return `True` for identical blocks with different locations. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function may not properly differentiate blocks with different locations, leading to the incorrect comparison result.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be modified to handle blocks with different locations properly. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to ensure it accurately differentiates blocks with different locations.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.size, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been modified to include the size of the block's values, ensuring that blocks with different locations are properly differentiated. Additionally, the comparison logic now considers both the block values' size and their locations, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
