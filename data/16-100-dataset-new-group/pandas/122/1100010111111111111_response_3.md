The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing the block locations of the two DataFrames, leading to a wrong comparison result. This is evident from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and the corresponding error message, which shows that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The bug occurs because the `equals` function is not properly considering block locations in its comparison. Consequently, DataFrames with identical blocks but different block locations are erroneously considered equal, as evidenced by the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method should also incorporate block locations in the comparison of blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers block location by converting the `mgr_locs` array to bytes for comparison. This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations are treated as unequal, and the `equals` function returns the expected result.

After applying this fix, the `equals` method should correctly compare DataFrames and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue on GitHub.
