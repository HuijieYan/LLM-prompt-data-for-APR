The bug in the `equals()` function seems to be related to comparing blocks with different locations but identical content. This is leading to a false positive where the function wrongly returns True when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks in different positions.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks is accurate and takes into account their positions.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort by labels
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x.index))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x.index))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, after ensuring the axes are of the same length and are equal, we then sort the blocks by their labels before performing the comparison. Sorting the blocks by labels ensures that identical blocks in different positions will still be correctly compared.

With this correction, the `equals()` function should now accurately handle the comparison of DataFrames with blocks in different positions.

Please note that the correction assumes that the `index` attribute of each block represents its label. If this is not the case, appropriate changes should be made to ensure proper comparison by labels.
