The bug in the `equals` function seems to be caused by the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which is defined inside the `equals` function. This sorting uses `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object, which may lead to inconsistency issues and incorrect comparison results. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting inside the `equals` function is based on a stable attribute that doesn't change state during comparison. We can use the `dtype` attribute of the block as a stable sorting key.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their `dtype` attribute, we ensure a stable comparison order for the blocks, preventing inconsistency issues.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
