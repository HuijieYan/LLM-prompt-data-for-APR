To correct the buggy function `equals`, we need to address the issue with sorting and comparing block values in the DataFrames. It seems the bug is in the `canonicalize` function and the comparison of block values.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the `canonicalize` function to handle categorical data correctly.
- Compare block values while considering the different block types and their methods for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if block._is_categorical:
            return (block._type, block.get_values())
        else:
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function updates the `canonicalize` function to handle categorical data correctly. Additionally, it includes the block type when sorting the blocks to ensure proper comparison.

This version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
