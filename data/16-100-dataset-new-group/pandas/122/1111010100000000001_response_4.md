The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. This function is used to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The potential error locations in this function could be the comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, the comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, and the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug could be due to the inconsistency in the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` in the `canonicalize` function. If the blocks are not sorted in the same order in both BlockManager objects, the equality check will fail even if the blocks themselves are equivalent.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to standardize the sorting order of the blocks in both the `self` and `other` BlockManager objects before performing the equality check.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort blocks based on dtype and manager locations
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks(other.blocks)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the blocks in both `self` and `other` BlockManager objects are sorted in the same order before performing the equality check, addressing the potential inconsistency in block ordering that may have caused the bug.
