### Analysis:
The `equals` function seems to be comparing different indices and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equivalent. This function uses a sorting mechanism to compare the blocks, but the comparison may be affected by differences in block locations, especially when the blocks are unconsolidated.

The error message indicates that the function returns `True` when it should actually return `False`. This suggests that the comparison logic is flawed.

The input parameter values provided in the failing test indicate that there are differences between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, particularly in the order of the blocks, which might explain the unexpected return value.

The GitHub issue further confirms the inconsistency in the return value of the `equals` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `equals` function failing to properly handle the block locations and their order when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. This results in incorrect comparison results and the function returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix this bug, it's necessary to modify the comparison logic to consider the blocks' content as well as their locations and order when determining if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. Sorting the blocks' content and location-based properties before the comparison would likely address the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: (b.values, b.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: (b.values, b.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is replaced with a lambda function to sort the blocks based on their values and locations. This ensures that the comparison considers both the content and the locations of the blocks, resolving the bug.
