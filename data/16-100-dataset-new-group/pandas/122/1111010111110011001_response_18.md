To fix the buggy function, we need to make sure that the comparison between DataFrame objects in the equals method considers the values and not just the column names. Currently, the buggy function compares the axes and blocks of the DataFrame objects without considering the actual values.

The bug occurs because the equals method of the DataFrame class compares the data based on the order of columns and their types, rather than the actual values in the columns. This causes the test_dataframe_not_equal test to fail, as it expects the DataFrame objects with different values to be considered as not equal.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the equals method to compare the actual values within the DataFrame objects, rather than just their axes and block structures.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return False
    
    # Compare the shape of the dataframes
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False
    
    # Compare the column names
    if list(self.columns) != list(other.columns):
        return False
    
    # Sort the dataframes by a column to ensure consistent comparison
    self_sorted = self.sort_values(by=self.columns[0])
    other_sorted = other.sort_values(by=other.columns[0])
    
    # Compare the values of the dataframes
    return self_sorted.to_numpy().tolist() == other_sorted.to_numpy().tolist()
```

This corrected version of the equals method compares the actual values within the DataFrame objects by sorting both dataframes and comparing their values. It checks if the shape and column names are the same before comparing the values. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the dataframes rather than just their structures.
