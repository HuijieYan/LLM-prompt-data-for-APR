The bug in the `equals` function that wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations is likely due to the sorting of the blocks in different orders. The `canonicalize` function, which is called to sort the blocks, appears to return a tuple that combines the type name and the locations of the blocks, such that unconsolidated blocks (e.g. Categorical) can only be distinguished by the iteration order. This may lead to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to use a more robust method of distinguishing blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Use block values in the comparison instead of sorting based on type name and locations
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the sorting of the blocks based on type name and locations, and instead directly compares the block values to determine equality. This should address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
