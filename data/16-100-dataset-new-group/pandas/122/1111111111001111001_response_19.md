To fix the bug in the "equals" function, we need to correct the comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager. It seems that the issue is related to the ordering and comparison of the blocks. 

Here's the corrected version of the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
- The "equals" method first checks the axes for equality and then consolidates the blocks using the "_consolidate_inplace" method.
- It then compares the blocks by first sorting them using a new function `canonicalize_block` that combines the block values and `mgr_locs`.
- Finally, it compares each block in the sorted lists and returns the result.

With this correction, the "equals" function should now pass the failing test case.
