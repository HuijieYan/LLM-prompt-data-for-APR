To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` accounts for the fact that the blocks may not be ordered in the same way in the two `BlockManager` objects.

The bug in the current implementation is that when comparing the blocks, it assumes that the blocks are in the same order in both `BlockManager` objects, which may not be true. To fix this, we should first sort the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, and then compare them.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects based on a tuple combining the block's type name and `mgr_locs`, which ensures that the comparison is done in a consistent order.

This should resolve the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
