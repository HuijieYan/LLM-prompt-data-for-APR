The issue is due to the `equals` function not properly comparing the content of the DataFrames. The runtime values show that the function does not correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames, leading to incorrect output and test failures.

The `canonicalize` function uses `block.dtype.name` to compare the blocks, which may not accurately represent the content of the blocks. This causes the incorrect comparison of blocks within the DataFrames, resulting in the `equals` function returning `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly compare the content of the blocks within the DataFrames. We should consider using a more robust method to compare the blocks, ensuring that the comparison accurately reflects the content of the DataFrames.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `block.values` to compare the content of the blocks instead of `block.dtype.name`. This ensures that the comparison accurately reflects the content of the DataFrames.

This fix should address the bug and resolve the issue posted on GitHub. After implementing this fix, the `equals` function should correctly compare the DataFrames and return the expected output, passing the failing test.
