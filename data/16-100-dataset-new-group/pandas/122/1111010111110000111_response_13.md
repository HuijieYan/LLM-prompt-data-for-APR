## Corrections

The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, where it is incorrectly identifying dataframes with different block order as equal. This causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to give an assertion error.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not properly handle the case where identical blocks have different locations. This causes the function to falsely return `True` when comparing dataframes like `df1` and `df2` in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function should be modified to properly compare the sorted blocks of each `BlockManager` instance, taking into account the order of the blocks.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `tobytes()` to handle block locations, the `equals` function will properly compare the sorted blocks of each `BlockManager` instance and return the correct result.

With these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly identify dataframes with different block orders as not equal, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.

I've implemented the suggested fix in the `equals` function. After you incorporate these changes, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
