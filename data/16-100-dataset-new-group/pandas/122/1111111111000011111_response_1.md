The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class has a logical flaw in the `equals` method. The function is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to determine if they are equal based on their axes, blocks, and data types. However, the function currently has a flawed logic for comparing the blocks in the `BlockManager`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not compare the blocks properly. It incorrectly compares the blocks' dtype and `mgr_locs` attributes using the `canonicalize` function. This can lead to the function wrongly returning `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should compare the blocks directly without using the `canonicalize` function, which is causing the incorrect comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of blocks has been simplified to directly compare the equality of each block in `self_blocks` with the corresponding block in `other_blocks`. This change will ensure that the comparison is done correctly and the function will now return the expected results.

This correction will resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class.
