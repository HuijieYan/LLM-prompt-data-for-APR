Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function seems to be in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The blocks are being sorted based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, but the sorting approach might not be correctly implemented. This leads to incorrect comparisons and the failing of the equality check.

To fix the bug, the approach to sorting the blocks needs to be revisited. Once that is corrected, the equality check needs to be re-implemented to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on type name and mgr_locs
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks(other.blocks)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the equality check should function as expected and pass the failing test.
