To fix this bug, we need to address the issue where the `equals` function returns True in cases where the blocks have identical values but different locations. The cause of this bug is due to the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations and may not consider the actual values within the blocks. To address this, we need to compare the block values directly rather than relying solely on sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    # Compare blocks directly by values
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the block values directly using the `equals` function, ensuring that we are comparing the actual values within the blocks rather than just the block types and locations.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly return False in cases where the blocks have identical values but different locations, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
