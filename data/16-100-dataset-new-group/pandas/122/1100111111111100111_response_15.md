The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when comparing two dataframes with identical blocks but different locations. This is contrary to the expected behavior and is the reason for the failing test.

The root cause of the bug lies in the way the `canonicalize` function is being used to sort the blocks for comparison. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple combination of the block's type name and the location, which is used to sort the blocks. However, the bug occurs because the block's location is not being correctly formatted into a list, causing the comparison to fail when it should succeed.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to correctly format the block's location into a list for proper comparison. Additionally, the implementation of the sorting logic needs to be revised to ensure it accurately compares the blocks based on their type and location.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Correctly format block location into a list for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_slice().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
