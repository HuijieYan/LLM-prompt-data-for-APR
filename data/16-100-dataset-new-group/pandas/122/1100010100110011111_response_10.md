The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should return `False`. This issue is identified in a GitHub post titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations." The function is incorrectly comparing the blocks using the `equals` method, leading to the wrong result.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly, taking into account the block type and manager locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's type and manager locations when comparing blocks. This change ensures that blocks with identical values but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

With this corrected function, the failing test case should now pass and the function should return the expected value of `False` when comparing the provided DataFrames.
