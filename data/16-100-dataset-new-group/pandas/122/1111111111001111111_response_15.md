### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the class and once inside the class. When the `equals` method calls `canonicalize`, it uses the wrong implementation, leading to incorrect results. This causes the `equals` method to return True when it should return False.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the duplicate `canonicalize` function from inside the class and ensure that the `equals` method calls the correct `canonicalize` function. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function properly orders and uniquely identifies the blocks based on their type name and location.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the type name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using a single `canonicalize` function and correctly ordering and uniquely identifying the blocks, the corrected function now properly compares the blocks for equality and returns the expected result. This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
