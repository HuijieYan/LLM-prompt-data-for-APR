The bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class seems to be causing the failing test. The error message indicates that the method is returning True instead of False when comparing two dataframes that are not equal.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic within the equals method. When comparing the self_axes and other_axes, the method is not checking if the lengths of the axes are equal before proceeding with the comparison. This can lead to a false positive result if the lengths are not the same.

To fix the bug, the code should first check if the lengths of self_axes and other_axes are equal. If they are not, the method should immediately return False. This will ensure that the comparison continues only when the lengths are the same.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False  # Added this line to handle unequal lengths
        
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the equals method should now return the correct result when comparing two dataframes, and the failing test should pass.
