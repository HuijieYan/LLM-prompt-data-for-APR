# The buggy function compares two objects using multiple conditions, but it appears to be missing important checks and error handling. The potential error locations include:
1. If the length of self_axes is not equal to the length of other_axes, the function returns False without further checks.
2. After consolidating the objects in place, the function does not handle any potential errors due to the consolidation process.
3. The function does not check for potential errors when sorting the blocks using the sorted() function.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle potential errors that may arise from the comparisons and sorting process. 

To fix the bug, the function should include error handling for the consolidation process and the sorting process. Additionally, it should also check for any potential edge cases or unexpected behaviors during comparisons.

        self._consolidate_inplace()

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        print(f"Error during sorting: {e}")
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
