The bug in the provided code is likely due to the sorting and comparison of blocks, which is causing the `equals` function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's shape in addition to the dtype name and mgr_locs. This will ensure that blocks with the same shape and dtype are correctly compared.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype name, mgr_locs, and block shape
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.shape, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function includes the block's shape in the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that blocks with the same shape, dtype, and mgr_locs are correctly compared.
