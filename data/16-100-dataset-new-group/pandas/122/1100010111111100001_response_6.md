The buggy function 'equals' seems to compare two BlockManager objects, 'self' and 'other'. It checks if their axes have the same length, then consolidates them, and sorts their blocks based on type and location. It then checks if all the blocks in 'self' are equal to the corresponding blocks in 'other'.

The failing test 'test_dataframe_not_equal' creates two DataFrames, df1 and df2, with different column types and values. It then asserts that df1.equals(df2) is False, indicating that they are not equal. However, the buggy function returns True instead of False, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location lies in the comparison of the blocks in 'self' and 'other' near the end of the 'equals' function. It seems that the comparison logic is incorrect and leads to a wrong result.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to correctly compare the blocks in 'self' and 'other' to determine if they are equal. This may involve inspecting the type and values of the blocks in each BlockManager and checking for equivalence.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.block_type, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the 'canonicalize' function now uses 'block.block_type' and 'block.values' to determine the key for sorting the blocks, providing a more meaningful comparison. Additionally, the comparison logic for the blocks has been updated to properly compare the blocks for equality.

This corrected version should pass the failing test 'test_dataframe_not_equal' and return the expected result, indicating that the DataFrames are not equal.
