## Corrections:

The bug in the equals function is causing it to return True incorrectly, leading to failing test cases.

The bug is likely in the canonicalize function, which is used to order and compare the blocks in the BlockManager. This is evident from the failing test case where comparing two DataFrames with the same data but different column orders incorrectly returns True.

The cause of the bug is that the equals function does not consider the order of the columns. When comparing the DataFrames, it does not account for differences in column order, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the equals function should take into account the order of the blocks and their contents. We also need to consider the column labels when comparing the DataFrames.

Here, I provide a corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.to_tuple())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version of the equals function, I modified the canonicalize function to consider both the block locations and their content when ordering and comparing the blocks. This ensures that differences in column order are correctly handled.

The corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
