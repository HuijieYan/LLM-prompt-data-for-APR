The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is trying to compare two BlockManager objects, but it has a few issues:
1. The function is trying to call `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` which seems to be intended to consolidate the data, but the function `_consolidate_inplace` is defined in the `BlockManager` class, not at the top level of the file.
2. The function also uses a nested function `canonicalize(block)` which is redefined within the function, causing confusion and potential errors.
3. The comparison logic at the end appears to be correct, but the issues mentioned above need to be fixed first.

To fix the bug, the nested function `canonicalize` and the call to `_consolidate_inplace` should be removed, and the correct version of `_consolidate_inplace` should be called from the `BlockManager` class. 

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With these changes, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
