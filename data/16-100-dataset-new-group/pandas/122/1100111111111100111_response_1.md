The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` incorrectly in the test case. The issue is that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects. The comparison logic is incorrect, leading to a false positive in the test case. This bug has been reported in a GitHub issue with the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be corrected to accurately compare the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue in the comparison logic and should accurately compare the `BlockManager` objects, resolving the problem reported in the GitHub issue.

After applying this fix, the failing test case should pass, and the behavior will align with the expected output.
