Based on the provided details, it appears that the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas` is encountering an issue when sorting and comparing blocks. The issue seems to be related to the way blocks are being sorted before the equality check, leading to failing test cases.

The problem with the existing code is likely due to the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function and how the blocks are sorted before the equality checks. To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting process using the `canonicalize` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Import the required libraries at the beginning of the file
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.internals import BlockPlacement

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other class methods and attributes remain unchanged

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Define a new canonicalize function
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.mgr_locs, str(block.dtype))

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple of `(block.mgr_locs, str(block.dtype))`, which should help identify and sort the blocks properly. This should fix the issue with the failing test case.

Please note that if additional properties or methods are required for comparison within the `canonicalize` function, they should be included to ensure proper sorting and comparison of blocks.

After applying this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly sort and compare blocks, resolving the failing test case.
