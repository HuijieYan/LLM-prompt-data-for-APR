The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two instances of the BlockManager class to check if they are equal. However, the bug occurs when comparing the blocks. The function calls the `canonicalize` function but there are two different implementations of the `canonicalize` function in the same class, which likely causes confusion and the bug.

To fix the bug, we can remove the duplicate `canonicalize` function and use the single version defined in the class. Also, we need to update the function to correctly compare the data in the blocks instead of using the `equals` method directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) and
        np.array_equal(block.mgr_locs, oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected `equals` function, it should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
