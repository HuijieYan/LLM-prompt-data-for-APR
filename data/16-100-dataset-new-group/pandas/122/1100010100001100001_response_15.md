The bug in the given function appears to be in the canonicalize function, specifically with the line "block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()". This seems to be causing the issue as it is not handling the values correctly.

To fix this bug, we can modify the canonicalize function to properly handle the values in the mgr_locs attribute. We can also check if the lengths of the blocks and axes are equal before the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs
        locations = []
        for loc in mgr_locs:
            locations.append(loc.start)
        
        return (block.ftype, tuple(locations))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these modifications, the function should now handle the block locations properly and provide the correct comparison results.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions or issues!
