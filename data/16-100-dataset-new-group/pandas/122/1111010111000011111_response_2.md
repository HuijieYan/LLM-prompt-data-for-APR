## Correction:

### Bug Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The bug occurs when the function fails to correctly compare the underlying `blocks` within the `BlockManager`. The issue on GitHub provides a clear example of the problem with the `equals` function, where it wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely to be located within the comparison logic for the `blocks` of the `BlockManager`. The comparison may not be correctly accounting for the order and location of the blocks, leading to incorrect equality results.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` even when the underlying blocks of two BlockManagers have different locations. This is due to the comparison not considering block locations and order, resulting in false positives for equality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the `blocks` needs to be revised to account for the location and order of the blocks. By ensuring that the comparison takes into account the unique identifiers of the blocks (such as type name and location), the function can accurately determine the equality of two `BlockManagers`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # revised canonicalize function to consider block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers both the type name, values, and block locations to create a unique identifier for comparison. This ensures that the equality check accounts for the actual content and location of the blocks, resolving the bug and aligning with the expected behavior.
