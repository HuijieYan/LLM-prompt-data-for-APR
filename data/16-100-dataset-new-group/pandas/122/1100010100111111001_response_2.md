The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects and return True if they are equal and False if they are not. The failing test is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` and expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return False, but it is returning True. This indicates that the comparison logic inside the `equals` function is not working as expected.

Analysis of the buggy function:
1. The function first compares the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`. If they are not equal, it returns False.
2. Then, it checks if all elements in `self_axes` are equal to the corresponding elements in `other_axes`.
3. It then consolidates and compares the lengths of the blocks in `self` and `other`.
4. Finally, it compares the blocks in `self` and `other` after sorting them based on type name and `mgr_locs`.

The potential error locations are the comparison of axes and the comparison of blocks after sorting.

Cause of the bug:
The comparison of axes and blocks after sorting might not be handling the comparison of different data types correctly. This could be causing the function to return True when it should be returning False.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the comparison logic for axes to handle different data types and ensure a strict comparison of their elements.
2. Update the comparison logic for blocks after sorting to ensure it considers the type and mgr_locs accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]) for i in range(len(self_axes))):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should handle different data types in axes and blocks, ensuring a proper comparison and returning the correct result for the failing test.
