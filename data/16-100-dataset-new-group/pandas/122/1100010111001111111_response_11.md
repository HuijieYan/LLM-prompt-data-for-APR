The bug in the `equals` function causes it to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is evident from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, where the expected output is `False`, but the actual output is not as expected.

The cause of the bug is identified in the function's implementation, particularly in the logic for comparing the blocks. The function compares the blocks using a canonicalization process that does not take into account the block locations, leading to incorrect comparisons and erroneous results.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization process needs to be revised to incorporate the block locations. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block locations in the tuple used for comparison. This will ensure that the blocks are correctly distinguished based on their locations, addressing the bug and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
