The bug in the equals function occurs when comparing the blocks of self and other. The function attempts to sort and compare the blocks, but it doesn't consider the actual data within the blocks, leading to incorrect results. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the canonicalize function to also include the block.values to ensure that the comparison between blocks is accurate. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and values to ensure accurate comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block values in the canonicalize function, we ensure that the comparison between blocks is accurate, which should fix the bug.
