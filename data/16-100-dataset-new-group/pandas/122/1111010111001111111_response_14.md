Based on the analysis, the buggy function `equals` fails to return the expected results. The issue arises from the way the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock`. This leads to the function returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. To fix this bug, the sorting logic in the `equals` function needs to be adjusted.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_slice(), block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is modified to use the `as_slice` method and the block itself in the tuple, ensuring that unconsolidated blocks can be properly distinguished. This modification should address the bug and make the `equals` function return the expected result, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
