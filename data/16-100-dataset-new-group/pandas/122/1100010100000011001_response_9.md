The buggy function is designed to check for the equality of two objects based on their axes and blocks. The function compares the axes and blocks of 'self' and 'other' objects and returns False if any differences are found. 

The potential error locations in the buggy function include the comparisons of 'self_axes' and 'other_axes', the sorting of 'self_blocks' and 'other_blocks' based on canonicalization, and the comparison of individual blocks using the 'equals' method.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle all possible cases and may not compare the objects properly, leading to incorrect equality checks.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the comparisons of 'self_axes' and 'other_axes' are accurate, the sorting of 'self_blocks' and 'other_blocks' is done correctly, and the comparison of individual blocks using the 'equals' method is performed accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through the axes to compare them individually, ensures that the blocks are consolidated before comparison, and compares the blocks based on their type and location to determine equality. This approach addresses the potential errors and ensures accurate equality checks.
