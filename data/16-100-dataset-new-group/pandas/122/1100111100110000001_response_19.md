The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two DataFrames `self` and `other` by using the `equals` method and then checking for equality of their axes, blocks, and values. However, the error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`, leading to the failing test.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the logic for comparing the axes, the consolidation of the DataFrames using `_consolidate_inplace`, and the comparison of the blocks after canonicalizing them.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic is not correctly handling the case when the DataFrames are not equal. This could be due to incorrect ordering of blocks or the comparison of the axes.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to revisit the comparison logic and ensure that it correctly handles cases where the DataFrames are not equal. Additionally, the ordering of blocks and axes should be carefully handled to ensure that the comparison is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the DataFrames
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Create a function to compare and sort the blocks
    def compare_and_sort(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.shape, block.dtypes)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=compare_and_sort)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=compare_and_sort)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version ensures that the axes are compared correctly, the DataFrames are consolidated before comparison, and the blocks are sorted and then compared. This should address the issues with the buggy function and pass the failing test.
