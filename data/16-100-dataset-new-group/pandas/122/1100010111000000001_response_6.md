## Fixing the buggy function

### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method, which is used to compare two data structures. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two dataframes are not equal, and it is expected to return `True`. However, the buggy function may not be handling the comparison correctly, resulting in a failing test.

### Identified potential error locations:
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the axes of the dataframes may not be correct.
2. The sorting and comparison of the blocks within the dataframes may not be done accurately.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug could be caused by incorrect comparison of the axes and the blocks within the dataframes in the `equals` method.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the comparison of the axes is accurate and appropriately handles the different data types in the dataframes.
2. Verify that the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the dataframes are done correctly.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The comparison of the axes is done using the `equals` method, which compares the values of the axes directly.
- The sorting and comparison of the blocks are based on the `_values` attribute of the blocks, ensuring a more accurate comparison of the data.

### Expected outcome:
The corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and accurately compare the dataframes.
