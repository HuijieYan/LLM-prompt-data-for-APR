The issue is with the `equals` method in the `Block` class. The failing test is trying to verify that two DataFrames are not equal, and it raises an AssertionError indicating that True is returned instead of False.

The problem lies in the `canonicalize` function and the sorting of blocks. The `canonicalize` function is creating a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`, but it does not take into account the fact that the columns of the DataFrame might be in a different order, which results in incorrectly sorted blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function and the sorting of blocks to consider the order of columns within the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, combining the type name and column values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.items))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass.
