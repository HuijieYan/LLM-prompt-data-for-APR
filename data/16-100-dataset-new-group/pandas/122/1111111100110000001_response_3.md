The buggy function `equals` is comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2` to check if they are equal. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing, as the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is resulting in `assert True is False`.

Potential error locations:
1. The comparison may be failing due to issues with the logic in the `equals` function.
2. There could be a problem with how the `as_array` and `_consolidate_inplace` methods are being called within the `equals` function, leading to incorrect comparison results.

Cause of the bug:
The bug could be due to discrepancies in the data types or order of the data within the `df1` and `df2` dataframes. This is resulting in the comparison returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the failing assertion.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the two dataframes is performed correctly, accounting for differences in data types and order.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected function above, the comparison should now handle discrepancies in data types and order, accurately determining if the two dataframes are equal. This should resolve the failing test scenario.
