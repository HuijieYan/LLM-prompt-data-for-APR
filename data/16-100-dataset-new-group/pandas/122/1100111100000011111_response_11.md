## Correction:

The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The issue happens when the `canonicalize` function is called with `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, but `mgr_locs` is not directly accessible from the `block` object.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `canonicalize` function receives the correct input and returns the expected output. We also need to ensure that the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is correct.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.index))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.index))
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.index.equals(oblock.index)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the corrected `equals` function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
