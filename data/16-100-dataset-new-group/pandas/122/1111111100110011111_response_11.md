The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should be returning `False`. The issue is related to identifying the block order in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The `canonicalize` function is being used to sort the blocks, but it is not implemented correctly.

The cause of the bug lies in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method. It is not returning the correct values to properly compare the blocks. This causes misordering, leading to the incorrect comparison result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly computes and returns the tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs to accurately represent the order of the blocks. Then, use this ordering to correctly compare the blocks and return the appropriate result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This version of the function correctly implements the `canonicalize` function to properly sort the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs. This ensures that the comparison between the blocks is done accurately, resolving the bug. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the GitHub issue.
