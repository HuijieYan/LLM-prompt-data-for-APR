## Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison of axes may not be handling the dataframe comparison correctly.
2. The comparison of blocks may not be correctly identifying the differences.

## Bug Cause
The `equals` function is not correctly identifying whether two dataframes are equal. This is due to issues with the comparisons of axes and blocks. The failing test is expecting the comparison of two unequal dataframes to return False, but the buggy function is not returning False in this case.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the comparison of axes to correctly identify differences between the two dataframes.
2. Update the comparison of blocks to handle different locations while considering the dataframe's equality.

## Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    for axis1, axis2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes):
        if not axis1.equals(axis2):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues with comparing axes and blocks. It should now correctly identify differences between two dataframes and return the expected results for the failing test case.
