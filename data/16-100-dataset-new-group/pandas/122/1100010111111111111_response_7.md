### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing the DataFrame blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but the buggy function is returning `True` in this case.

The buggy function first compares the axes of the two DataFrames, which is correct. Then, it compares the blocks of the two DataFrames. However, the buggy function erroneously sorts the blocks based on their types and locations before performing the comparison. This sorting process causes the blocks to be compared incorrectly, leading to the wrong result.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the sorting based on block type and location needs to be removed. Instead, the function should directly compare the blocks without reordering them. This will ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the DataFrames.

### Corrected Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and correctly compare the DataFrame blocks without sorting.
