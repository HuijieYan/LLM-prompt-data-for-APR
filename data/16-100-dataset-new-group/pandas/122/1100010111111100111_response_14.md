The issue is caused by the `equals` method not correctly identifying when two DataFrames should be considered equal. It fails to compare the content of the DataFrames correctly. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects the call `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it is returning `True`, leading to the assertion error.

The specific problem is within the `equals` method in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The method compares the axes of the two DataFrames and the blocks within them. The comparison seems to be going wrong when sorting and comparing the blocks.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing and potentially rewriting the logic for comparing the blocks. It may involve changes to the `canonicalize` function or the comparison logic itself. The goal would be to accurately identify when two DataFrames should be considered equal and return the appropriate boolean value.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function uses both `block.mgr_locs` and `block.values` to create a unique representation for sorting and comparing the blocks. This should ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the content of the DataFrames.
