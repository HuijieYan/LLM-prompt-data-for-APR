To fix the buggy function, we need to update the `equals` method in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The bug causes the method to incorrectly return True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The buggy code fails the given test case, specifically when comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. The expected result is `False`, but the method incorrectly returns `True`.

The bug is due to the incorrect handling of the block locations during comparison. When sorting the blocks, the `canonicalize` function should also include block locations to ensure identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to include block locations in the comparison. Additionally, the comparison logic should be updated to consider both block type and location.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these updates, the corrected `equals` method should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values. This will also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
