The buggy function `equals` is not behaving as expected, causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to return True in a case where it should return False. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with different locations.

After analyzing the runtime values, the actual return values, and the expected return values, it appears that the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function is producing an incorrect result. The `canonicalize` function is currently creating a tuple with `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, but this is not effectively capturing the block characteristics for proper comparison.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to construct a tuple that accurately represents the block characteristics for comparison. We can achieve this by including more comprehensive block information, such as the block-type-specific data, as part of the tuple for sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Modified canonicalize function to construct a better tuple for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        block_info = [block.shape, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()]
        return tuple(block_info)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The modification to the `canonicalize` function aims to create a more comprehensive representation of the block characteristics, including shape, dtype, and location information, to ensure a proper comparison.

Once this corrected version is implemented, it should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and produce the expected output.
