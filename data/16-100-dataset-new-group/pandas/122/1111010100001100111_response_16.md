## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The comparison of the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`. This may not accurately reflect the equality of the axes.
2. The sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`.

## Cause of the bug
The bug may be caused by the faulty comparison of the axes and the sorting of blocks.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of axes and the way blocks are sorted for comparison.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]) for i in range(len(self_axes))):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on their actual values and not just dtype names
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, we are directly comparing each axis using the `equals` method and comparing the blocks based on their actual values using the `equals` method as well.
