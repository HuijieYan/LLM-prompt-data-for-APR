Given the provided information, the buggy function "equals" is incorrectly returning True when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The bug is causing the failing test to assert that `df1.equals(df2)` is False, but the actual result is True.

Based on the information provided, the root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the "equals" function should be modified to properly handle identical blocks with different locations. One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the comparison logic within the "equals" function to account for differences in block locations when comparing DataFrames. This might involve checking the block locations as part of the comparison process to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not erroneously deemed equal.

Here's a corrected version of the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare block lengths and locations
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        block1, block2 = self_blocks[i], other_blocks[i]
        if block1.shape != block2.shape:
            return False
        if not block1.mgr_locs.equals(block2.mgr_locs):
            return False
        
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This modified version of the "equals" function includes additional logic to compare block lengths and locations when comparing DataFrames. By ensuring that the block lengths and locations are considered in the comparison process, the function should now correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
