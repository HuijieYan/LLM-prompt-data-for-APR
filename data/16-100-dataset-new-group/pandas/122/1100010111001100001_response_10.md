The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the incorrect comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function would show the behavior from the test code, where `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False` indicating that the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal. The issue arises because the function fails to compare the content inside the blocks correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the content inside the blocks is compared correctly. One way to do this is to include logic to compare the content within the blocks after sorting them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
