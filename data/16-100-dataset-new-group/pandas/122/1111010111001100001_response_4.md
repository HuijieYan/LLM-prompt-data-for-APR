The bug in the buggy function `equals` lies in the logic that compares the blocks of data between two `BlockManager` instances. 

The issue arises due to the comparison of `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` in a specific order for both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances. This results in the comparison of the blocks in a non-canonical order, leading to incorrect results.

A strategy to fix this bug would be to sort the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances based on their type and then compare them. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # sort and compare blocks
    def block_sort_key(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_sort_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass successfully.
