The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect comparison of DataFrame 'df1' with 'df2' using the .equals() method, resulting in the failure of the test. The expected output is False, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal.

The bug occurs in the equals() function, specifically in the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks. The bug causes the function to erroneously return True instead of False.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the sorting of the blocks is done correctly to accurately compare the DataFrames.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the sorting of blocks is performed using the type name and mgr_locs to ensure that they are compared accurately.

After applying the correction, the failing test case will now pass, and the function will return the expected output.
