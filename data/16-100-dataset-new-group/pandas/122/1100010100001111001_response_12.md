Error:
The buggy function is not handling the comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks correctly, resulting in false comparison results.

The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the sorting of self.blocks and other.blocks being based on the canonicalize function, which uses block.dtype.name and block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(). This can lead to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks, leading to a false comparison result.

Strategy to fix the bug:
Instead of sorting and comparing self.blocks and other.blocks using the canonicalize function, it would be better to directly compare the blocks based on their content and order.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
