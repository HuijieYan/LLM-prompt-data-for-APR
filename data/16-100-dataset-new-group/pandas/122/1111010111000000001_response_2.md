The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. Mismatched lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` may cause a false positive for equality.
2. Unconsolidated blocks may not be properly accounted for in the comparison.
3. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` may not be performing as expected due to the comparison of unconsolidated blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not account for unconsolidated blocks, resulting in a false positive for equality. This is reflected in the failing test where `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` should pass, but does not due to the unaccounted unconsolidated blocks.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should first check for the same number of axes, then consolidate both `self` and `other` BlockManagers before comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` should now pass.
