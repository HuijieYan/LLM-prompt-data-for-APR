The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects and their attributes such as `axes` and `blocks`. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, which results in `df1.equals(df2)` returning `True` incorrectly in certain scenarios.

The problem lies in the way the blocks are being compared. Specifically, the `canonicalize` function is meant to determine the order and the characteristics of the blocks, but there seems to be an error in its implementation that causes the comparison to fail in some cases.

To address this issue, we should ensure that the blocks are properly ordered and compared based on their characteristics. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks in a consistent manner that accurately reflects their contents and characteristics before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on their characteristics for accurate comparison
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the blocks are properly ordered and can be accurately compared, addressing the underlying issue and resolving the GitHub bug.
