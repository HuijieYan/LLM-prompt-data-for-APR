## Analysis:
The buggy function is meant to compare two objects and return True if they are equal, and False if they are not. The function compares the axes, consolidates the objects, checks the length of blocks, and then compares the blocks for equality. 

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function may have an error in comparing the axes.
2. The function might not be consolidating the objects properly.
3. There could be an issue with the comparison of blocks.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug may occur due to inconsistent comparison of axes, improper consolidation of objects, or a flawed comparison of blocks.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of axes is accurate.
2. Properly consolidate the objects before comparison.
3. Check the comparison of blocks to make sure it is valid.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
