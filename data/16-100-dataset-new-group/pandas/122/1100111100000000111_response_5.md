The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is sorting the blocks and comparing them using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and `mgr_locs` to distinguish unconsolidated blocks. However, the bug occurs when the same blocks are located differently in the two DataFrames, leading to incorrect `equals` comparison results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's data content as well. This way, the comparison will also take into account the actual content of the blocks, in addition to their type and location.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using both type name, data, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison takes into account the actual data content of the blocks in addition to their type and location. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
