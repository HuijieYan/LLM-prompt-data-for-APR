The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class appears to be related to the sorting and comparison of block objects. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects and determine if they are equal. However, the comparison process is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

The bug could be occurring in the sorting of blocks and comparison of individual blocks for equality. Additionally, the strategy for sorting and comparing blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` could be problematic.

Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test to return `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix this bug, the sorting and comparison of blocks need to be revisited. Additionally, it might be necessary to further investigate how specific block attributes are being utilized in the comparison process.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using block index for sorting
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: self.blocks.index(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: other.blocks.index(block))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on their original index positions rather than using `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This should ensure that the blocks are properly ordered for comparison.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
