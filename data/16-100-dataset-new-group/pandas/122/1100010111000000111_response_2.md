To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks in both dataframes before the comparison. This should ensure that the blocks are sorted in a consistent manner before the `equals` comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The changes made to the `canonicalize` function include using `str(block.dtype)` to convert the dtype name to a string, and using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring()` to convert the `mgr_locs` to a string representation. This ensures a consistent and deterministic sorting order for the blocks.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
