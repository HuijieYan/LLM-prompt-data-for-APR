The buggy function is the `equals` method. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing. This means that the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. 

From the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it seems that the bug is likely located in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The method compares the blocks in `self` and `other` by their type names and `mgr_locs`. It then sorts the blocks based on this comparison and checks if they are equal.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the sorting and comparison of blocks based on their type names and locations. It seems that the comparison logic is not correctly identifying the differences between the blocks in `self` and `other` when the DataFrames are not equal.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the blocks needs to be revised to correctly identify the differences between the blocks in `self` and `other` when determining equality.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.to_list()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.to_list()
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are converted to lists using the `to_list` method. This change ensures that the blocks are compared correctly for equality and should fix the bug.
