The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method returns `True` instead of `False`, causing the assertion to fail. This points to a bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class.

The bug in the `equals` method seems to be related to the comparison of the data blocks. The method sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, and then compares each block in `self` with the corresponding block in `other`. The bug likely lies in the comparison logic that is used to compare the sorted blocks.

A potential strategy to fix the bug in the `equals` method is to revisit the logic for comparing the sorted data blocks. It may involve making modifications to the `canonicalize` function or the comparison process for the sorted blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a modified `canonicalize` function and a revised comparison process for the sorted blocks. The comparison now checks for equality of values and manager locations within each block. This should address the bug and ensure that the corrected version passes the failing test.
