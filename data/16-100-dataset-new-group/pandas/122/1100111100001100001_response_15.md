The buggy function is the equals method within the BlockManager class in the pandas core internals. The function compares two BlockManager objects for equality by checking if their axes are equal and if their blocks are equal. If either of these conditions fails, the function returns False.

The bug in the function arises from the sorting of the blocks. The canonicalize function is incorrectly defined within the equals method instead of as a separate function. This causes the sorting to malfunction and leads to incorrect equality comparisons.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be defined as a separate function outside of the equals method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other methods...
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By defining the canonicalize function outside the equals method, the sorting of blocks will function correctly, and the function will compare two BlockManager objects for equality as intended.
