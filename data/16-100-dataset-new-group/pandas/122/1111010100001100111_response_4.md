## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class seems to be related to the sorting of the blocks. The bug causes the function to return `True` when it should return `False` in the case where identical blocks have different locations. To fix this, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a way that takes into account their content and location simultaneously, so that blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.

## The corrected version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block_list):
        canonicalized = []
        for block in block_list:
            canonicalized.append((block.values._scalar_data, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        return tuple(canonicalized)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
