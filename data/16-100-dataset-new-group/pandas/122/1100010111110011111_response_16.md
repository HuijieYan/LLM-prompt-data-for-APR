In the given buggy function, the issue seems to be with the sorting of the blocks using the canonicalize function. This is causing the function `equals` to return True even when the dataframes are not equal, as observed in the failing test.

The buggy function fails for the given test case because it returns True instead of False, resulting in an assertion error. This happens because the sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function is not correctly identifying the differences in the dataframes.

To fix the bug, we need to update the canonicalize function to properly differentiate between the blocks in the dataframes. We can achieve this by using the block values directly in the canonicalize function, ensuring that it accurately represents the contents of each block and thus allows for correct comparison and sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `block.values` directly in the canonicalize function, we can ensure that the sorting is based on the actual data within the blocks, leading to a correct comparison between the dataframes. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test case.
