To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison is made correctly and returns the expected output. Based on the provided test function and the GitHub issue, the bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations.

The root cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks of the two DataFrames, taking into account their locations. One potential solution is to update the `canonicalize` function to account for the locations of the blocks in addition to their data type names. Then, use the updated `canonicalize` function when sorting and comparing the blocks in the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making this change, the `equals` function should correctly compare the DataFrames and return the expected output. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes.
