The issue in the `equals` function occurs because the comparison of axes and blocks is not being performed correctly.

Specifically, the bug causes the `equals` function to wrongly return True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is done accurately to reflect the expected behavior during the test.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(), block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
