The buggy function is intended to compare two BlockManager objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks.

The bug occurs due to the way block objects are sorted and compared. The current implementation compares the blocks directly, but the comparison should consider the block type (dtype.name) and the block's location (mgr_locs).

To fix the bug, we should modify the canonicalize function to return a tuple that combines the type name and the mgr_locs, and then use this tuple to sort the blocks for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function returns a tuple of the dtype name and mgr_locs. This allows for proper sorting and comparison of the blocks.
