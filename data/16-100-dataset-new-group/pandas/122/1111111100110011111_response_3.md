## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. It appears that the method `canonicalize` is being redefined inside the `equals` method, which may cause a conflict with the outer `canonicalize` method.

## Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the redefinition of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method. This redefinition may be causing unexpected behavior when sorting the blocks.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the redefined `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method should be renamed to avoid conflicts with the outer `canonicalize` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Renamed the inner canonicalize function to avoid conflicts
    def _inner_canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=_inner_canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=_inner_canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
