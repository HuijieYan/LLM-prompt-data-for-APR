### Analysis
The function `equals` is supposed to compare two DataFrames and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise. The failing test shows that the function is returning `True` when the DataFrames are not equal, causing an Assertion Error.

### Identified Potential Error Locations
1. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` function.
2. The comparison of individual blocks for equality.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from how the function `equals` handles the comparison of individual blocks within the DataFrames. It fails to handle the scenario where identical blocks with different locations are present in the DataFrames, leading to an incorrect result being returned.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function `equals` should be modified to also consider the location of the blocks when comparing them. This will ensure that identical blocks at different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Ensure mgr_locs are included in the comparison
    def canonicalize_with_locs(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_with_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_with_locs)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, a new `canonicalize_with_locs` function is introduced to include the block values and locations in the comparison. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.
