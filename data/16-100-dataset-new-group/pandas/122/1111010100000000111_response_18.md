The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class has the issue of wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, as identified in the GitHub issue. The problem arises due to the comparison of internal blocks with different locations but identical content, causing the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `equals` function to compare the content of internal blocks regardless of their locations, ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual data rather than their positions in memory. This will align with the expected behavior and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare block content regardless of their locations
    self_blocks_content = [block.get_values() for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [block.get_values() for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_block_content, other_block_content) 
        for self_block_content, other_block_content in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
- We compare the content of internal blocks using the `get_values` method to retrieve the actual data from the blocks.
- We use `np.array_equal` to compare the content of each pair of blocks.
- By comparing the block content regardless of their locations, we ensure that the `equals` function returns the expected result in scenarios where identical blocks with different locations are present.
