Based on the information provided, the bug in the `equals` function is caused by the fact that it does not correctly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager`. When comparing blocks, it incorrectly sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which doesn't properly account for the block's manager locations, resulting in a false positive in the `equals` comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the manager locations of the blocks in the sorting key.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the updated `canonicalize` function that includes the block's manager locations, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager` and return the expected output, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
