The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This results in failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and an assertion error.

The issue appears to be related to the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The sorting is based on the block's type name and manager locations, but because the different DataFrame objects have blocks with different locations, the comparison returns `True` erroneously.

To fix this bug, the sorting for the blocks needs to be adjusted in a way that properly handles identical blocks with different locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on dtype and content to handle identical blocks with different locations
    def block_sort_key(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtypes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_sort_key)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been replaced with `block_sort_key` to sort the blocks based on their values and data types, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are handled properly.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes.
