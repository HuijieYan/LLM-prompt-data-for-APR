Based on the error message and the provided runtime input/output values, it seems that the `BlockManager.equals` function is not correctly comparing the blocks. The issue reported on GitHub also confirms this problem, where the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks. 

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False
    
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(
        [(blk.get_values(), blk.mgr_locs) for blk in self.blocks],
        key=lambda x: (x[0].dtype.name, x[1].as_array.tolist())
    )
    
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(
        [(blk.get_values(), blk.mgr_locs) for blk in other.blocks],
        key=lambda x: (x[0].dtype.name, x[1].as_array.tolist())
    )
    
    return all(
        (sblk_values == oblks_values) and (sblk_locs == oblks_locs)
        for (sblk_values, sblk_locs), (oblks_values, oblks_locs)
        in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly get the values and manager locations for each block, and then compare them. This ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations will not wrongly return `True` when checked for equality.

By applying this fix, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
