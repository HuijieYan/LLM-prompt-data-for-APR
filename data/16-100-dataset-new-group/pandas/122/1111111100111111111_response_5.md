Based on the error message and the provided runtime and expected values, it seems that the issue lies in the comparison of block equality within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue description in the GitHub issue suggests that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the block comparison within the `equals` method, specifically within the block sorting using the `canonicalize` function. It seems that the block equality check should return `False` when comparing `df3` and `df4` based on the expected output in the GitHub issue.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the block sorting and comparison within the `equals` method to properly handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version modifies the block sorting criteria and comparison to properly identify the equality of blocks with different locations. It should satisfy the failing test and the expected input/output values.
