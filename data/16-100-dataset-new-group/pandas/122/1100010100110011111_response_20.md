The buggy function `equals` in `managers.py` is not returning the expected value for the test case provided. The test case is checking whether two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal, but the function returns `True` instead of `False`. The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function compares the DataFrames' blocks and their locations.

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made to the function:
1. Update the logic for comparing the blocks within the DataFrames.
2. Ensure that the function returns the correct boolean value based on the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks and their locations directly
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]) or self.blocks[i].mgr_locs != other.blocks[i].mgr_locs:
            return False

    return True
```
This corrected version directly compares each block in the DataFrames and their respective locations. If any block or location differs, the function returns `False`, otherwise, it returns `True`.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and return the expected boolean value based on the comparison of the DataFrames.
