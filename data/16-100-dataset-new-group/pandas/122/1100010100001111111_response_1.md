The bug in the function `equals` causes it to wrongly return True in the case of identical blocks with different locations. The bug occurs because the function does not take into account the block locations when comparing two DataFrames. To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to also include the block locations when sorting the blocks. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and block values
    def canonicalize(block, mgr_locs):
        return (block.dtype.name, mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted([(self.blocks[i], self.items[i]) for i in range(len(self.blocks))], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(other.blocks[i], other.items[i]) for i in range(len(other.blocks))], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    return all(
        block[0].equals(oblock[0]) and block[1] == oblock[1] for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
  )
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by considering the block locations and values during the sorting process, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not wrongly considered as equal.
