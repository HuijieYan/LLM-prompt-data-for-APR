The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two dataframes that have different values. This is likely due to the incorrect comparison logic in the function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not comparing the values of the dataframes correctly, leading to a false positive assertion in the test.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function properly compares the values of the dataframes, and returns `False` if any differences are found.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    for i, (block, oblock) in enumerate(zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly compares the values of the blocks in the two dataframes, returning `False` if any differences are found. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
