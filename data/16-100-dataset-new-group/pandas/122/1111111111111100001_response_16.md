The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the current implementation is failing to do so, as evidenced by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. 

On analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables within the function, it seems that the comparison logic in the function is incorrect. The `canonicalize` function uses `sorted` to sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, but the way it compares the blocks is not accurate, leading to the failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to review and update the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Additionally, the way blocks are being sorted and compared in the `canonicalize` function should be re-evaluated.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self.blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype))
    other.blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

The changes made involve sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the combination of `mgr_locs` and `dtype`, as this is a more accurate way to distinguish the blocks. After these changes, the `equals` function should pass the failing test.
