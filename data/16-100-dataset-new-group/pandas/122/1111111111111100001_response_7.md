The bug in the `equals` function causes it to incorrectly compare dataframe blocks, which leads to a failed test.

The root of the problem lies in the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function. This function is meant to return a tuple that combines the type name and the manager locations of a block. However, the code for creating this tuple is incorrect, causing the `equals` function to sort the blocks improperly and compare them incorrectly.

To fix this, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly create the tuple to be sorted. We can use the block's dtype name and the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` method to create the tuple for sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version properly creates the tuples needed to sort the blocks, ensuring that the `equals` function compares them correctly. This should make the failing test pass.
