The issue with the buggy function is that the `equals` method is not correctly comparing two BlockManager instances. 

The faulty logic seems to be with the way the `canonicalize` function is being defined and implemented, leading to unexpected block ordering when it comes to comparing the blocks within the BlockManager instances.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be moved outside of the `equals` method, and it should be defined within the `BlockManager` class. Additionally, the `equals` method should compare the `mgr_locs` and `dtype` of blocks in the BlockManager instances to ensure that they are being compared properly. 

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods)

    # Move the canonicalize function here within the BlockManager class
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected code, the `canonicalize` function is now defined correctly within the `BlockManager` class, and it will be used to properly compare the blocks within the BlockManager instances when the `equals` method is called.

This should address the bug and ensure that the provided failing test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` now passes successfully.
