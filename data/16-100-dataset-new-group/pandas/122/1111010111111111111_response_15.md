The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations. This behavior is not expected and causes a failing test.

To fix the bug, we can modify the canonicalization process for the blocks to include the block's content in addition to its type name and manager locations. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly differentiated during comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name, 
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), 
            block.values
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version of the `equals` function ensures that the comparison of blocks includes both their type name, manager locations, and block values. This fixes the bug and ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly differentiated during comparison.
