To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is accurate and takes into account the location of the blocks. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` due to the identical blocks with different locations.

The bug is likely in the implementation of the `equals()` method, where it does not consider the location of the blocks when comparing them. This causes the method to erroneously return `True` for blocks with identical content but different locations.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the `equals()` method to consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them. We can achieve this by including the location information in the comparison logic and ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals()` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check if the sorted blocks are equal, taking into account the block locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we include the `canonicalize()` function that takes into account the block's data type and location. Then, we sort the blocks based on this criterion and compare them to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

This approach addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by accurately comparing the blocks while considering their locations.
