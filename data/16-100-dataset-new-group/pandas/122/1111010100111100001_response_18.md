The issue with the `equals` function is that it is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. 
The input parameters, type and values, are consistent with the expected behavior and don't seem to be causing the problem. 
The relationship with the BlockManager class is that the function `equals` is used to compare BlockManagers for equality.

The bug is caused by the comparison logic inside the function, where it's incorrectly returning `True` when the two BlockManagers are not equal.

To fix the bug, we need to revisit the comparison logic inside the `equals` function and ensure that it correctly checks for equality between the two BlockManagers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize blocks and check for equality
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
This corrected version modifies the comparison logic to use the `equals` method directly on the blocks of the BlockManager. This should resolve the issue where the function was incorrectly returning `True` when the BlockManagers were not equal.
