The buggy function has an issue with comparing the axes and blocks of two BlockManager objects. The function is not properly handling the comparison and sorting of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not effectively comparing the axes and blocks of the two BlockManager objects, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison and sorting logic for the axes and blocks to ensure accurate comparison between the two BlockManager objects.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with the comparison and sorting of axes and blocks within the function to ensure accurate comparison between the two BlockManager objects.
