The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class. One issue with the function is that it calls the `canonicalize` function twice, one in the outer scope and once within the `sorted` function. Additionally, the return value for `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` seems to be incorrect because `mgr_locs` is an attribute and not a method. 

To fix the bug, remove the inner `canonicalize` function as it is unnecessary, and access `mgr_locs` directly without the `tolist()` method. Also, ensure that the function is consistently called from the class, and access any attributes or methods within the block properly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
