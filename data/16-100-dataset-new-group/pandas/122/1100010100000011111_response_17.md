To address the issue in the buggy function, we need to ensure that identical blocks with different locations do not incorrectly return True when calling the `equals` method. 

In the provided case, the expected output is supposed to return False when calling `df3.equals(df4)`, but the buggy function does not handle this correctly. The cause of this bug lies in the sorting and comparison of the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. It does not take into account the actual values of the blocks, leading to potential misidentification of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block values in addition to their dtype name and manager locations.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the `block.values` in addition to `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not wrongly identified as equal, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
