## Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
- This method compares two block managers and returns `False` if they are not equal, based on their axes, blocks, and block locations.
- The GitHub issue states that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The comparison logic within the `equals` method may be flawed, leading to incorrect results.
- The canonicalization of blocks using the `canonicalize` function may not be accurately capturing the equality of blocks with different locations.
- Usage of `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` could potentially alter the block locations and affect the equality comparison.

## Bug Cause:
- The cause of the bug is two-fold. First, the comparison logic within the `equals` method is not accurately capturing the equality of blocks with different locations. Second, the canonicalization of blocks using the `canonicalize` function is not effectively handling the comparison of blocks with different locations.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method needs to be revised to accurately handle the equality of blocks with different locations. Additionally, the canonicalization of blocks using the `canonicalize` function should be modified to ensure that it correctly captures the equality of blocks with different locations.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the blocks without altering their location
    self_consolidated = self.apply('consolidate')
    other_consolidated = other.apply('consolidate')

    if len(self_consolidated.blocks) != len(other_consolidated.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_consolidated.blocks, key=lambda block: repr(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other_consolidated.blocks, key=lambda block: repr(block))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` method has been modified to first consolidate the blocks without altering their location using the `apply('consolidate')` method. Then, the blocks are sorted based on their representation using `repr()` to ensure consistent comparison, and equality is checked for each pair of blocks. This approach accurately captures the equality of blocks with different locations.
