### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py`, which handles a lightweight blocked set of labeled data to be manipulated by the DataFrame public API class.
2. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking if they have the same axes and blocks in the same order. It uses the `_consolidate_inplace` method to ensure that both instances are consolidated before comparison.
3. The error message suggests that the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that should not be equal.
4. The GitHub issue confirms the problem, stating that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
5. The issue is caused by the comparison not taking into account the order of blocks and their locations, leading to incorrect equality checks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `equals` method to consider the order and location of blocks when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
2. Implement a sorting mechanism for the blocks before the comparison to ensure that identical blocks in different locations are not considered equal.

### Corrected version:
```python
# Fixing the buggy equals method in the BlockManager class
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Sort the blocks by type name and location to ensure proper comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By implementing the changes above, the `equals` method will now properly handle comparisons between `BlockManager` instances, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
