The buggy function `equals` is a method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. The comparison of `block.equals(oblock)` might be incorrect if the `block` and `oblock` are not equal.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function might not be properly handling unconsolidated blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the two `BlockManager` instances, resulting in a failed assertion when it is called with different DataFrames. This is evident from the error message, which shows that the assertion `assert True is False` is failing, indicating that the equality comparison is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the comparison of `block.equals(oblock)` is correct and handles different types of blocks properly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function is correctly handling unconsolidated blocks.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrections made, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.
