The bug in the `equals` function is likely related to the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The function is sorting the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs` using the `canonicalize` function and then comparing the sorted blocks using the `equals` method, but there might be an issue with the comparison logic.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the function for Case 1:
- The values and types of `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `self.blocks`, and `other.blocks` are as expected.
- Before the return, the values and types of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are as expected. There is an instance of `block` and `block_setup` which are used for the sorting process.

One potential cause of the bug could be that the `canonicalize` function is not properly defining the unique key for each block, which could lead to incorrect sorting and comparison.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to create a unique key for each block based on type and location. Additionally, the comparison logic within the `equals` function should be thoroughly tested and potentially revised to ensure that it properly compares the sorted blocks.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Create a unique key for each block

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `canonicalize` function now creates a unique key for each block based on its type and location. This should ensure that the blocks are properly sorted and compared, fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
