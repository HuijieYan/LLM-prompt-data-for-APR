The bug in the provided function is likely causing the `equals` method to return the wrong result. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects the `equals` method to return `False`, but it incorrectly returns `True`, leading to an assertion error.

The cause of the bug is that the sorting operation for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is not performed correctly, and it does not consider the block's data and locations, hence producing the wrong result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the inner function `canonicalize` to properly capture the block's type name and manager locations. Then, we need to use this modified function to sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` arrays before comparing their equality.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case and return the expected `False` value.
