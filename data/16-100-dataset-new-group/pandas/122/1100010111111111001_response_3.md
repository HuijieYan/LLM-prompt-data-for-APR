The bug in the equals method is causing the failing test to assert the incorrect value. The buggy equals method is being used to compare two DataFrames and should return False if the DataFrames are not equal. In this case, the method is returning True instead.

The bug occurs in the canonicalize function used to sort the blocks. The issue is that the block.dtype.name is being used instead of block.dtype which is incorrect and causes the sorting function to produce an unexpected result, leading to the incorrect comparison in the equals method.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be modified to use block.dtype instead of block.dtype.name when sorting the blocks. This will ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their data type, as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the equals method should now compare the DataFrames correctly and return False when they are not equal, passing the failing test.
