## Analysis

The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. The problem arises when the function returns True even when the blocks have different locations. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates this issue by creating two DataFrames with the same data but in different columns. The expected behavior is for the `equals` function to return False in this case.

The issue seems to stem from the comparison of the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances. Specifically, the function does not consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them, leading to incorrect results.

## Cause of the Bug

The bug occurs when comparing the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances. The `equals` function should account for the locations of the blocks, which is not currently being done. This leads to the function returning True even when the block locations are different.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them. One approach is to sort the blocks based on both their data type and location, ensuring that the comparison takes into account the positions of the blocks. Additionally, the comparison should return False if the lengths of the blocks are different, as this indicates a mismatch in the data structure.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.values), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
