The buggy function `equals` is contained within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers.py` file. The desired behavior is that the function should compare two `BlockManager` objects, and return `True` if they are equal and `False` if they are not.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects and asserts that their `equals` method returns `False`.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, which suggests that the `equals` method returns `True` when it should return `False`.

The buggy function `equals` compares the attributes of two `BlockManager` objects. The code first compares the axes of the two objects and returns `False` if they have different lengths or if any pair of corresponding axes are not equal. Then it calls the `_consolidate_inplace` method on both objects, compares the number of blocks they contain, sorts the blocks based on their dtype and manager locations, and then compares each pair of sorted blocks.

Based on the runtime variables and the expected values, it seems that the issue arises when comparing the blocks. The comparison should be based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their positions.

To fix the bug, modify the comparison of blocks to compare the block content directly instead of comparing their positions.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    # Compare axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the BlockManager inplace
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Compare the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Verify the equality of each block
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        # Directly compare block content
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now compare the content of blocks directly, ensuring that it returns the correct result and passes the failing test.
