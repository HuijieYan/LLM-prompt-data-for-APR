def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.index.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

## Explanation
The root cause of the bug is that the original `canonicalize` function incorrectly used `block.dtype.name` to differentiate the blocks, while it should have used `block.dtypes` and `block.mgr_locs.index.to_list()` to correctly identify the blocks. This caused the failing test, as it was trying to compare dataframes with different data types, resulting in a False assertion.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function to use `block.dtypes` and `block.mgr_locs.index.to_list()` to provide a unique identifier for each block. This will ensure that the comparison of blocks between dataframes considers the data types and locations, thus fixing the failing test.

Following the strategy, a corrected version of the `equals` function has been provided above. The correction addresses the issue in the `canonicalize` function and provides a unique identifier for each block, ensuring the correct comparison between dataframes.
