The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two DataFrames `self` and `other`. However, it appears that the current implementation of the function does not compare the DataFrames correctly, leading to failing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The potential locations of the error in the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of `self.axes` and `other.axes` might not be providing the expected result.
2. The usage of `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` might not be working as intended.
3. The sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function might not be accurate.

The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that the current implementation is not correctly comparing the two DataFrames. This could be due to issues with how the axes, block consolidation, or canonicalization is being handled.

To fix the bug, a potential strategy would involve:
1. Ensuring that the comparison of `self.axes` and `other.axes` is accurately capturing the differences between the DataFrames.
2. Reviewing the implementation of `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` to ensure that they are consolidating the DataFrames as expected.
3. Verifying that the sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function is correctly identifying differences between the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate both DataFrames
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks
    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that the comparison of the two DataFrames is accurate and should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
