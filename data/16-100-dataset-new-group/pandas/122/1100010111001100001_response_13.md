The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects and return True if they are equal, and False if they are not. However, the function contains a bug that causes it to return the wrong result when comparing two dataframes.

The bug occurs in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparison. It uses the `mgr_locs` attribute of the Block object, which is causing the incorrect sorting of blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use a unique attribute of the block that is more suitable for sorting. For example, we can use the block's index or data type to ensure consistent and correct sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the block's index
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._grouper_infos

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we use the `_grouper_infos` attribute of the block object for sorting, as it provides a unique identifier for each block. This should ensure correct block sorting and fix the bug.
