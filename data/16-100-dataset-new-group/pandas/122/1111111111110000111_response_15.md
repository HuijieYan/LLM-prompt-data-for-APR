## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (hash(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the inconsistency in identifying identical blocks with different locations. This inconsistency leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two dataframes with identical blocks in different locations.

The issue is caused by the failure to properly distinguish between identical blocks in different locations during the comparison process. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing dataframes with the same blocks but varying locations.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should implement a more robust method for identifying and comparing identical blocks within the dataframes, accounting for potential differences in block locations.

The corrected version of the `equals` function accounts for these issues by using a more thorough method for canonicalizing block order. This ensures that the comparison process correctly identifies and differentiates between blocks with identical content but different locations.
