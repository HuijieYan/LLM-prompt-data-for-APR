The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. Based on the runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the comparison of the blocks is not taking into account the order of the blocks. This means that even if the contents are the same, if the order of the blocks is different, the function will return False.

To fix this issue, we can modify the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to include a sort based on the order of the blocks as well.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    """

            return False

        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` and return the correct result for the failing test.
