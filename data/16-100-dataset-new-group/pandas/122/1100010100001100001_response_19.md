Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug is related to the sorting and comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. The function is sorting the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes, but the attribute `mgr_locs` is not being used as intended when comparing the blocks.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to revise the sorting and comparison process for the blocks in the `equals` function. Additionally, the comparison of `mgr_locs` should be handled differently to ensure accurate comparison of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_equals(block, oblock):
        return block.equals(oblock)

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not block_equals(self.blocks[i], other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are compared using a for loop that iterates through each block and checks for equality. This ensures that each block is compared accurately and avoids potential issues with incorrect comparison.
