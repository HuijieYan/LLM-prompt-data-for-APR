The buggy function `equals` is comparing two dataframes `self` and `other` by their axes and blocks. If the lengths of their axes are not equal, or if not all axes are equal, or if the blocks are not equal, the function returns False. However, the error message shows that the function is returning True when it should return False.

The cause of the bug seems to be the comparison of the blocks. The code sorts the blocks in both dataframes and then compares them. This comparison is not correctly working, resulting in the function returning True when the blocks are not equal.

To fix this bug, the comparison of the blocks needs to be revised.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x.dtype))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x.dtype))
    if self_blocks != other_blocks:
        return False
    return True
```

This correction sorts the blocks based on their data types using `str(x.dtype)` and then compares the sorted blocks directly. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the correct result.
