Based on the provided information, it seems that the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` when comparing `DataFrame` objects with identical blocks but with different locations. This behavior is incorrect and causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return `False` when it should be `True`.

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` should be updated to properly account for identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, tuple(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we modify the `canonicalize` function to use the block's `mgr_locs` and `values` to properly order and compare the blocks within the `BlockManager`. This change should address the issue and ensure that the `equals` function correctly handles comparisons of identical blocks with different locations.

After applying this fix and updating the `BlockManager` class, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now return the expected result `True`.
