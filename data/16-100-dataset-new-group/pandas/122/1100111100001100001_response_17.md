The bug in the provided code seems to be due to the comparison of blocks in the 'equals' function. The bug might be related to how the blocks are being compared, sorted and canonicalized. 

The main issues with the given code appear to be:
1. The use of the 'canonicalize' function within the 'equals' function without properly defining it or calling it from the class.
2. Incorrect comparison and sorting of blocks.

To address these issues, the 'canonicalize' function should be properly defined and called within the 'equals' function. Additionally, the comparison and sorting of blocks should be handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the code with the fixes:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other functions and class declarations here...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version:
1. The 'canonicalize' function has been declared within the 'equals' function.
2. The 'as_array' method is called on 'block.mgr_locs' to obtain a list for comparison.
3. The correct comparison and sorting of blocks are being performed.

These fixes should address the issues and ensure that the 'equals' function works as intended.
