The issue with the `equals` function seems to stem from the comparison of dataframes with different datatypes and values in the failing test. The function is returning `True` instead of `False` for the given test case, which is causing the assertion error.

The bug is likely occurring in the `canonicalize` function where it is sorting the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. In the given failing test, `df1` and `df2` have different datatypes and values, causing the `equals` function to return `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to check for both the datatype and values of the blocks to ensure that different dataframes with different datatypes and values are not considered equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Check both dtype and values to ensure comparison of dataframes with different datatypes and values
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return `False` for the failing test case, resolving the bug.
