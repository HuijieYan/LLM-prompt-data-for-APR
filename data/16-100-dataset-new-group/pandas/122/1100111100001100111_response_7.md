## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class occurs due to the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. These blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and manager locations of the block. However, the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method is flawed when the blocks have identical data but different locations. This leads to the function wrongly returning `True` in cases where the actual expected output should be `False`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the data within the block for comparison, rather than the block locations. This will ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as different, resulting in the correct `False` output.

## Corrected Function
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been replaced with lambda functions in the `sorted` method's key parameter. It now uses the `values.tostring()` attribute of the blocks for comparison.

This modification ensures that the comparison is based solely on the data within the blocks, irrespective of their locations, thus fixing the bug reported on GitHub.
