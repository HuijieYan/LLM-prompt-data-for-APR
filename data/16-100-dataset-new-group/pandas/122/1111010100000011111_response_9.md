## Correction

The issue relates to the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module. The `equals` method has a bug where it incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares the `axes`, `blocks` and their contents between two `BlockManager` instances (`self` and `other`). The bug appears to be related to the comparison of blocks, specifically when blocks have identical content but different locations.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks does not consider the location of the blocks. As a result, when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks in terms of content but different locations, the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should also consider the locations of the blocks to ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are not falsely considered equal.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), id(block)
        )  # Changed to include block location

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` method now includes the block's location (using `id(block)`) as part of the tuple passed to `canonicalize`. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations will not be falsely considered equal.
