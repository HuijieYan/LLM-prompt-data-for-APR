The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function. It appears that the sorting is not correctly taking into account the differences in the block locations of identical blocks, leading to a wrong comparison result.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations as part of the sorting tuple. Additionally, you can modify the comparison in the `equals` function to ensure that not only the block types and data but also the block locations are compared.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now behave correctly and provide the expected results for comparisons, including the case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
