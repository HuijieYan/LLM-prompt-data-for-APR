The bug in the provided code seems to be in the `canonicalize` function, where it uses the `as_array` attribute without parenthesis as if it were a method, and it's not. It should be called as an attribute, not as a method.

To fix this bug, the `as_array` attribute should be accessed directly without invoking it as a method. Also, the `canonicalize` function should be moved outside of the `BlockManager` class to avoid duplicating it within the class. Additionally, ensure that the function `canonicalize` has the correct variable scope when accessing `block`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

# BlockManager class declaration
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods in the class remain unchanged)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function is now outside the `BlockManager` class, and it correctly accesses the `as_array` attribute without invoking it as a method.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
