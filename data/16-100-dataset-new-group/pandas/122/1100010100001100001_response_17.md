The bug in the provided function "equals" seems to be due to the comparison of the "self.blocks" and "other.blocks" tuples. The comparison is being done without taking into account the order of the blocks within the tuples. This can lead to false negatives when the order of the blocks is different between the two BlockManager instances.

To fix the bug, we can sort the blocks before comparing them. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" tuples are sorted using the "canonicalize" function before being compared. This ensures that the order of the blocks does not affect the comparison, fixing the bug.

This approach should address the bug and make the function return the correct result based on the provided input parameters.
