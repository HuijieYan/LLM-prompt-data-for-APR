The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison logic and the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. It is important to ensure that the block order is properly canonicalized before performing the comparison.

The bug seems to be occurring because the `canonicalize` function is defined both within the `BlockManager` class and outside it, and the one defined outside the class is being called instead. This results in the `canonicalize` function not being able to access the necessary attributes of the `block` object.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be defined within the `BlockManager` class, and it should take the `block` object as a parameter. This will allow it to access the necessary attributes of the `block` object for proper canonicalization.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions)

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Define the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By defining the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class, we ensure that it can access the necessary attributes of the `block` object for proper canonicalization, which should fix the bug.
