Based on the provided information, the buggy function compares two BlockManager objects by checking their axes and blocks. However, the comparison of the block objects seems to be erroneous due to a faulty sorting mechanism using the canonicalize function. 

The faulty part of the code is likely within the canonicalize function and the subsequent sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function such that it returns a comparable value for each block. Additionally, the sorting mechanism should be adjusted to accommodate the sorting of the processed block values.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function now returns a tuple containing the type name and the values of the block. This will allow for a consistent and comparable way to sort the blocks.
