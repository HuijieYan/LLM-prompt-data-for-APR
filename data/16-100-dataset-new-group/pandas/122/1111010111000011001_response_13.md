The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two DataFrames. The `equals` function fails the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` by returning `True` when it should return `False` for the given input DataFrames `df1` and `df2`.

The bug occurs when the `equals` function compares the `self_axes` and `other_axes`, as well as when comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly compare the axes and blocks of the two DataFrames. This results in a false positive comparison, leading to the incorrect return value of `True` instead of the expected `False`.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to compare the values of the axes and blocks directly, rather than relying on the `equals` method. This can be achieved by comparing the values of the axes and blocks individually and returning `False` if any differences are found.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not (ax1.values == ax2.values).all():
            return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].values.equals(other_blocks[i].values):
            return False
        
    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the values of the axes and blocks to ensure an accurate comparison. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function return the expected values for the failing test case.
