### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug in the `equals` function is likely related to the way it compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The issue reported in GitHub indicates that the `equals` function returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This suggests that the function may not be correctly comparing the blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to ensure that it properly compares the blocks irrespective of their locations.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly
    for i, (block1, block2) in enumerate(zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
        # compare dtype and location of blocks
        if block1.dtype.name != block2.dtype.name or not block1.mgr_locs.equals(block2.mgr_locs):
            return False
    return True
``` 

In this corrected version of the `equals` function, we iterate through each block of `self` and `other`. For each pair of blocks, we compare their equality and also compare their dtype and location. If any of these comparisons fail, we return `False`. If all comparisons pass, then we return `True`.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
