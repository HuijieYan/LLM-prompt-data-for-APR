The bug in the `equals` method is likely caused by the `canonicalize` function not being properly defined within the `BlockManager` class. As a result, the `canonicalize` function from the file is being called instead of the one defined within the class.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly define the `canonicalize` function inside the `BlockManager` class and modify its usage within the `equals` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By incorporating the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class and using `self.canonicalize` while sorting the blocks, we ensure that the correct `canonicalize` function is called. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
