### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is expected to compare two BlockManager objects by checking their axes, blocks, and block order. However, it mistakenly returns True when the blocks have identical content but different locations. This issue is reflected in the GitHub problem description where a simple comparison of two DataFrames using the `equals` function incorrectly returned True, while the expected result was False.

The bug is likely caused by the comparison logic that does not consider the actual block locations when comparing block equality. Additionally, the code does not handle sorting and comparing block locations between the two BlockManager objects. This leads to incorrect results in scenarios where the content of the blocks is the same, but the locations are different.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function should be expanded to properly handle sorting and comparing the block locations between the two BlockManager objects. Additionally, the function should consider block locations in addition to block content when determining block equality. 

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions remain the same)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Compare block locations and contents
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.values))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.values))
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison logic now sorts the blocks based on their locations and content before performing the equality check. This ensures that the comparison considers both the block content and the block locations when determining block equality.
