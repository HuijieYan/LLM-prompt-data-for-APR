The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` file. The function is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` and their underlying data. The error message from the failing test suggests that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

Upon reviewing the function, the bug appears to be related to the comparison logic where the `canonicalize` function is being used to compare blocks. The error message specifically indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, leading to the test failure and the bug reported on GitHub.

One potential cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not correctly differentiating between the blocks when they have the same content but different locations. This could result in the comparison incorrectly identifying them as equal.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's content as well as its location in the `BlockManager`. By incorporating both factors into the comparison, we can ensure that the blocks are differentiated correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # correct implementation of canonicalize function
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.get_values().tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected logic, the `equals` function should now appropriately handle the comparison of blocks and return the expected result, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
