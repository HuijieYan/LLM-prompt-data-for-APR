The buggy function is the equals method within the BlockManager class in the pandas core internals. The function compares two BlockManager objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, it fails to account for a potential mismatch in the order of the blocks within the BlockManager objects.

The buggy code sorts the blocks within each BlockManager object using the canonicalize function and then compares the sorted lists for equality. However, the canonicalize function is missing from the BlockManager class and is defined outside of it, resulting in an error when the equals method is called.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be moved inside the BlockManager class and then called within the equals method to ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions in the BlockManager class 
    # ...
    
    # Fixed equals method
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # Define the canonicalize function inside the BlockManager class
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By moving the canonicalize function inside the BlockManager class, it is now accessible within the equals method, and the comparison of sorted blocks should work correctly. This change should fix the bug and make the failing test case pass.
