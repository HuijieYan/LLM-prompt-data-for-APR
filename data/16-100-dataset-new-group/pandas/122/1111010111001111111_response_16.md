## Bug Explanation
The buggy function "equals" is failing to identify that the DataFrame objects df1 and df2 are not equal. The issue arises because the function does not effectively compare the blocks within the BlockManager, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the "equals" function should be modified to correctly compare the blocks within the BlockManager. This may involve restructuring the logic to ensure that the blocks are compared accurately.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values._block_type, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the "equals" function should now effectively compare the blocks within the BlockManager, resolving the issue and ensuring that the failing test case passes.
