The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` incorrectly. The root cause of this bug is that the function does not handle cases where identical blocks have different locations. This causes the function to incorrectly report `True` for equality.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to handle cases where identical blocks have different locations. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations before performing the equality check.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are handled correctly, and the `equals` function should now return the correct result for the failing test case.
