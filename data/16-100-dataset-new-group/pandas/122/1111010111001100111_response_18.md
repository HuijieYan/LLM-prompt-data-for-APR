The issue with the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is that it fails to correctly compare the equality of two BlockManagers when the blocks have identical content but different locations. This leads to incorrect return values for the `equals` method, causing the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py`.

The cause of the bug is in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparison. The bug arises from the fact that the `canonicalize` function only considers the dtype name and manager locations, which may not be unique identifiers for comparing blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function considers all relevant attributes that define a block, not just dtype name and manager locations. This will provide a more accurate comparison and resolve the incorrect return values for the `equals` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    ...
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name, mgr_locs and content to ensure unique identification
        def canonicalize(block):
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
            content = block.iget(0).values
            return (block.dtype.name, locs, str(content))

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block's content in addition to dtype name and manager locations to create a unique identifier for comparison. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are correctly distinguished during comparison, leading to the expected behavior for the `equals` method.
