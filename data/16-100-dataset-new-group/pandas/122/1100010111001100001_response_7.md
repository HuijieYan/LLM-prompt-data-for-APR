The bug in the equals function is likely caused by the comparison of blocks. The function sorts the blocks by type and location, but it does not take into account the specific values within the blocks.

To fix the bug, the equals function should compare the actual values within each block, rather than just comparing the block objects.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly compares the values within each block, ensuring that the blocks are actually equal, rather than just comparing the block objects. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
