The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager objects for equality. Based on the provided code, it's difficult to identify a specific bug, as the error message does not provide enough information about the issue. However, we can examine potential error locations in the function and make assumptions based on the test case and runtime values.

Given the runtime values and types of the input parameters and relevant variables at the function's return, it seems like the comparison of block contents may not be accurate, leading to the failure of the test case.

A strategy to fix this bug could be to revise the canonicalization of block order to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before performing the comparison.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function `equals`:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is used to sort blocks based on their `mgr_locs` attribute, ensuring a consistent order for comparison. This approach should address the issue and make the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
