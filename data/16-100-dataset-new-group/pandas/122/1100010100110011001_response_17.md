The buggy function `equals` is designed to check for equality between two data structures, but it is currently failing and returning unexpected results. The error message from the failing test states that the function is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of axes lengths and elements.
2. The comparison of blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the comparison of different data types properly. This leads to the function returning unexpected results when comparing data frames with different data types.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to check for compatible data types before comparing the axes and blocks. This will ensure that the function can handle different data types without crashing or returning incorrect results.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    return True
```

In this corrected version, we use a loop to compare each pair of axes and blocks individually, ensuring that their data types are compatible before performing the comparison. This prevents the function from returning unexpected results when dealing with different data types.
