Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it appears that the issue with the buggy function lies in the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks by both their data type and manager locations. This sorting operation is causing the bug where identical blocks with different locations are not being handled correctly.

To fix this bug, a potential strategy would be to revise the `canonicalize` function to prioritize comparing the data values directly, rather than using their data type and manager locations for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # prioritize comparing the data values directly
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this revised `canonicalize` function, the bug should be resolved and the failing test should pass.
