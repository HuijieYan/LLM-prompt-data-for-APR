The cause of the bug is that the equals function is not handling the comparison of DataFrames with different data types correctly. When comparing DataFrames with different data types, the function is returning True instead of False, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the equals function to handle DataFrames with different data types. We can achieve this by adding an additional check to compare the data types of the DataFrames before executing the original comparison logic.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.dtypes.equals(other.dtypes):
        return False
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the equals function will first check if the data types of the DataFrames are equal. If they are not, it will return False, ensuring that the correct comparison logic is executed only when the data types match.
