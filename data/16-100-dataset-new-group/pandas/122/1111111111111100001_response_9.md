The bug in the provided `equals` function occurs when comparing two DataFrames. It appears the bug may lie in the way the blocks are being compared between the self and other BlockManager instances. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates this with the error message: `assert True is False`, where the expected result should be `False`.

Here is the likely cause of the bug:
1. When comparing the axes of the self and other BlockManager instances, the lengths are checked first. If they are not equal, `False` should be returned. However, if they are equal, the function should continue to compare the axes themselves.
2. The function then calls `_consolidate_inplace` on both the self and other objects to ensure that the blocks associated with each instance are consolidated.
3. The function then compares the length of the self and other blocks. If the lengths are not equal, `False` should be returned.
4. Next, the function sorts the blocks within each instance using a custom `canonicalize` function, and then iterates over each block to compare them using the `equals` method.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the number of axes are equal, and if so, continue with the comparison of each axis.
2. This logic may need to be revisited if the consolidation method is not functioning correctly.
3. Verify that the blocks within the instances are being compared correctly. It's possible that the way blocks are being sorted and compared could be causing the issue.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Ensure block is sorted by dtype

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This corrected version should ensure that all relevant comparisons are made and the blocks are sorted appropriately for comparison.
