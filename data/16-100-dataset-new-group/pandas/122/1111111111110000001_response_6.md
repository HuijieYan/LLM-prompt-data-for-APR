The buggy function is the 'equals' method within the 'BlockManager' class in the 'pandas/core/internals/managers.py' file. This method is designed to check if two 'BlockManager' objects are equal by comparing their shapes, axes, and blocks. 

The potential error locations within the 'equals' method are:
1. Incorrect comparison logic for the values of 'self_axes' and 'other_axes'.
2. Usage of 'self._consolidate_inplace()' and 'other._consolidate_inplace()' may not be appropriate or causing unintended consequences.
3. Sorting and comparison of 'self_blocks' and 'other_blocks' might be flawed. 
4. Inconsistent usage of 'canonicalize' function within the 'equals' method.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for comparing the 'BlockManager' objects is flawed, leading to the failing test. The error message indicates that the assertion 'assert df1.equals(df2) is False' is evaluating to 'True is False', which means that the 'equals' method is returning True when it should be False.

To fix the bug, the 'equals' method should be corrected to properly compare the 'BlockManager' objects based on their axes and blocks.

Below is the corrected version of the 'equals' method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # First call consolidate to make sure block shape representations are the same
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalizer(blocks):
        return {block.shape: block.values for block in blocks}

    self_canonical = canonicalizer(self.blocks)
    other_canonical = canonicalizer(other.blocks)

    return self_canonical == other_canonical
```

After the above corrections, the failing test should pass, and the comparison logic should work as intended for the 'BlockManager' objects.
