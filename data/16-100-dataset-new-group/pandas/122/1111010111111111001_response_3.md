The bug in the `equals` function seems to be on the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. The error message indicates that the comparison of the ordered blocks is not returning the expected output.

The cause of the bug may be due to the sorting of the blocks which is relying on the `canonicalize` function. This function is probably not performing the correct sorting based on the expected values of the blocks.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to review and modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it constructs the sorting key in a way that accurately captures the properties of the individual blocks for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(blocks):
            return [(block.values, block.mgr_locs) for block in blocks]

        self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
        other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)

        return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
