The bug in the `equals` function is that it is trying to call the `canonicalize` function from the same class without the `self` parameter. This is causing the `canonicalize` function to be called from the global scope instead of the class scope, resulting in an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to add `self` as a parameter to the `canonicalize` function and also ensure it's called as a method of the class. Additionally, the `_consolidate_inplace` method should be called on `self` and `other` before comparing their blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(self, block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(other, block))
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With these changes, the `canonicalize` function is now a method of the class and properly called using `self`. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
