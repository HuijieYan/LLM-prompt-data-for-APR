Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The failing test specifically checks for the case when `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it is failing and returning `True` instead.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the DataFrames. It sorts the blocks using a `canonicalize` function, and then compares sorted lists of blocks from `self` and `other` using the `equals` method. This approach is flawed, as it does not properly handle the case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be updated to handle the case of identical blocks with different locations, so that the comparison in the `equals` method is done correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to handle identical blocks with different locations
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return [tuple(block.values.tolist()) for block in blocks]

    self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now correctly compares the blocks within the DataFrames, handling the case of identical blocks with different locations. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
