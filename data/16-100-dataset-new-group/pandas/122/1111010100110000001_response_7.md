The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. However, it seems to be failing to compare the two DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` in the failing test.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison logic in the conditional statements.
2. Sorting and comparison of the block elements.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not correctly comparing the two BlockManager objects. This is evident from the error message, which shows that the comparison is resulting in `assert True is False`, indicating that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the comparison logic is correctly implemented, and the sorting and comparison of the block elements are performed accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks.tolist(), key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks.tolist(), key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values)
        and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
1. We first check for axes equality and consolidate the objects inplace.
2. Then, we check for the equality of block count and then proceed to compare the block elements using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks and compare their values and manager locations.

After applying the correction, the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test case should now pass successfully.
