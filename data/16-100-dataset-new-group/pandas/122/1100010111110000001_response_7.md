The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to raise an assertion error. The `equals` function is used to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` and check if they are equal. However, due to the bug in the function, the comparison is not providing a correct result.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function is trying to compare and sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, but it is not doing so correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks is not properly specified, leading to the wrong sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should correctly return a tuple combining the type name and manager locations so that the blocks can be properly sorted and compared.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and provide the correct comparison between the DataFrames `df1` and `df2`.
