The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to wrongly return `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations. This issue occurs due to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which leads to the wrong comparison of blocks.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to properly sort the blocks for comparison. Additionally, the comparison logic inside the `equals` function should be revised to handle the comparison of blocks with different locations correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.to_slice().start)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to sort the blocks based on both the values and the start index of the block's `mgr_locs`, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are handled correctly during comparison. The comparison logic now correctly compares the sorted blocks from `self` and `other` to determine their equality.
