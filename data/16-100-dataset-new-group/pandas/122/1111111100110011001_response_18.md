The bug in the `equals` function is likely causing the function to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two dataframes that are not equal. This is evident from the error message, which shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing and returning `True` instead of `False`.

The `equals` function starts by comparing the axes of the two dataframes, then it consolidates the dataframes in place, and finally compares the blocks. The bug could be in any of these three steps.

Upon further inspection, the bug in the function is identified in the comparison of blocks. The function is using the `sorted` function to compare the blocks, but the `sorted` function does not take into account the order of the blocks. This can result in `block.equals(oblock)` returning `True` when the blocks are not actually equal.

To fix the bug, the `sorted` function should be replaced with a different method that takes into account the order of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks by iterating over them
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    return True
```

With this correction, the function should now compare the blocks properly and return the correct result. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
