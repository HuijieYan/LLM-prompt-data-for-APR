The bug in the given function appears to be that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the `BlockManager` class and once inside it. When the buggy function `equals` is called, it attempts to use the `canonicalize` function that is defined outside the class, but the correct one it should use is the `canonicalize` function defined inside the class.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function is defined correctly within the `BlockManager` class and remove the redundant definition outside the class.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods)

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # define canonicalize function within the class
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By defining the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class, we ensure that the correct version of the function is used when calling `equals`. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test case.
