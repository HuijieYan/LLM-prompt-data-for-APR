### Analysis
The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file. The function is used to compare the equality of two `BlockManager` objects, which represent the internal data structures of pandas DataFrames. The error message in the failing test indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This discrepancy is causing the test case to fail.

The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, sorts and compares the blocks, and returns the result. The `self_axes` and `other_axes` are checked for length and equality, then the `blocks` attribute of the two objects is compared.

The runtime input/output values provided suggest that the function is failing to correctly compare the two `BlockManager` objects, leading to an incorrect result.

The GitHub issue further confirms that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should return `False` for the specific dataframes provided. The expected behavior is for the function to return `False` in this case.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by a failure in the comparison logic when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. This results in a wrong interpretation of the equality of the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects needs to be revisited, ensuring that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values._dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version above, the comparison logic for the blocks has been modified to accurately reflect their equality. This ensures that the `equals` method correctly determines the equality of the two `BlockManager` objects, addressing the bug. The corrected version should now return the expected result and pass the failing test.
