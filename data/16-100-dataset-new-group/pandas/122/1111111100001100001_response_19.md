The bug in the buggy function is likely due to a comparison error between the blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. The function first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal and if all the elements in both lists are equal. Then, it tries to canonicalize the block order and compare each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`.

The bug may be in the way the blocks are being compared. It's possible that the comparison logic is not correctly handling the block contents and their order.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples needs to be reviewed. It might be necessary to implement a custom comparison logic for the block contents, taking into account their order and types.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks the lengths and equality of the axes. Then, it consolidates the blocks and compares each block in the `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`, ensuring that the order and contents of the blocks are correctly compared. If any comparison fails, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
