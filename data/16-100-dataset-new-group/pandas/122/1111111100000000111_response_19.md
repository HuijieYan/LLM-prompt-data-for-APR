The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This bug was reported in a GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The user expected the `df3.equals(df4)` method to return False, but it incorrectly returned True.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not considering block locations when comparing DataFrames. The function only sorts the blocks based on their type name, and then compares the blocks without considering their locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to take into account the locations of the blocks when comparing two BlockManagers.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(
        zip(self.blocks, self.items), key=lambda x: (x[0].dtype.name, x[0].mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())
    )
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(
        zip(other.blocks, other.items), key=lambda x: (x[0].dtype.name, x[0].mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())
    )

    return all(
        ((block.equals(oblock)) and (item == other_item)) for (block, item), (oblock, other_item) in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we sort the blocks of each `BlockManager` based on their type name and locations using `mgr_locs.as_array.tostring()`. Then, we compare the sorted blocks and their corresponding items to ensure the equality of the two `BlockManagers`.

This correction ensures that the equality check considers both the type of the blocks and their locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
