The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks and their locations within the `BlockManager` instances. The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` in cases where two `BlockManager` instances have identical blocks with different locations. This behavior was not as expected and caused a GitHub issue. 

The bug is likely located in the comparison of block locations and types within the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks for comparison.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to include the block's location information before sorting the blocks using the `mgr_locs`. This will ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are properly distinguished.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The modification includes adding `block.mgr_locs` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to the tuple returned by the `canonicalize` function before sorting the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to properly take block locations into account during comparison. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result based on block content and location.
