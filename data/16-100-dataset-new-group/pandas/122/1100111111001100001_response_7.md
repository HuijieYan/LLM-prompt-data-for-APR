The bug in the provided function `equals` seems to be the result of incorrectly comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` objects, as well as not consolidating them properly before comparison. The `canonicalize` function is intended to order the blocks for comparison, but it may not be working correctly.

The following steps can be taken to fix the bug:
1. Consolidate the blocks in `self` and `other` before comparison.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to properly order the blocks to ensure accurate comparison.
3. Update the comparison logic of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` objects to correctly check for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function based on the above steps:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected function, the failing test should now pass.
