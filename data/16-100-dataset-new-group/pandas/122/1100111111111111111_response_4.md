The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. The bug occurs when comparing the equality of two data frames.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of the dtype and mgr_locs of the blocks in the `equals` function. The incorrect comparison leads to a `True` return value for the equality check of data frames, which should actually be `False`.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to consider the dtype and mgr_locs for comparing block equality. Additionally, there should be a comparison of the number of blocks between the two data frames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, dtype,
    # and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks which can only
    # be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above changes, the `equals` function now takes into account the dtype, mgr_locs, and the number of blocks, ensuring that the comparison between two data frames is accurate.

After making these changes, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, resolving the GitHub issue related to the bug.
