The bug in the provided function is causing the `equals` method of DataFrames to return `True` incorrectly in cases where the blocks are identical but are located in different positions.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists is not taking into account the locations of the blocks, causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered as equal.

To fix this bug, the comparison of blocks should also consider their locations. This can be achieved by extending the `canonicalize` function to include the block's locations when creating the tuple for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the comparison now includes the block's locations, resolving the issue and causing the failing test to pass.
