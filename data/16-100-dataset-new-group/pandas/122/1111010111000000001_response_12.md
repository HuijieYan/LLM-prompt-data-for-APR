The potential error in the equals function lies in the sorting of the blocks. It seems that the function is not properly handling the case where the dataframes have different dtype for the columns. This could be causing the test to fail.

The bug in the equals function seems to be related to how it compares the data blocks of the two BlockManager objects. It sorts the blocks based on their dtype.name and mgr_locs, but it does not take into consideration the case when the dtypes of the columns are different between the two BlockManager objects.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the canonicalize function to include the dtypes of the blocks as well. Then, when sorting the blocks, it should first check if the dtypes are the same, and only then proceed to sorting based on dtype.name and mgr_locs.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version, the equals function should now be able to properly compare the BlockManager objects and pass the failing test.
