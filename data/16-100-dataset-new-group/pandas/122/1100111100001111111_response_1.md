The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return incorrect results. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function is returning True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, when it should return False.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The `equals` function attempts to canonicalize the block order using a sorting method to compare the blocks. This sorting method relies on the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a tuple for comparison. However, the bug may be occurring due to the `canonicalize` function being defined twiceâ€”in the `BlockManager` class and globally.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function is correctly called and the block comparison is done based on the expected input/output values. The correct implementation of the `equals` function should compare the blocks based on their content and not their locations.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the data before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on their content
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we remove the unnecessary sorting of the blocks based on location and instead directly compare the blocks based on their content using the `equals` method.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
