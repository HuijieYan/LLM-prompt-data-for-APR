## Corrections

1. The main issue with the buggy `equals` function is that it's not checking for the equality of data within the DataFrame blocks. It only compares the number of blocks and their order, which may lead to false positives.
2. The comparison logic should be updated to ensure that the data within each block is compared to determine if the DataFrames are equal.

## Updated Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.value, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

By updating the `equals` function to compare the contents of each block in addition to their structure, the function should now be able to correctly determine if two DataFrames are equal. This should resolve the bug and address the GitHub issue.
