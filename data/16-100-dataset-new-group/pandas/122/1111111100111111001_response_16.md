The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is likely due to incorrect block comparison. The method attempts to compare blocks in a sorted order without properly defining the `canonicalize` function for block comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `canonicalize` function properly and use it for sorting the blocks before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # define the canonicalize function for block comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype)

    # sort the blocks using the canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By defining and using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks, we ensure that the comparison between `self` and `other` blocks is consistent. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` method work as expected.
