The potential error in the buggy function lies in the comparison of the blocks. It appears that the order and type of the blocks may not be consistent between the two BlockManager instances being compared.

The cause of the bug is that the sorting of the blocks with the 'canonicalize' function is not taking into account the entire block information, leading to potential mismatch during comparison.

To fix the bug, we can modify the 'canonicalize' function to include both the block type and the 'mgr_locs' information, which uniquely identify each block. Additionally, we can update the block comparison to consider the block type and 'mgr_locs' information.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the function should now compare the blocks based on both their type and the 'mgr_locs' information, ensuring a correct and consistent comparison. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
