The bug in the `equals` function arises from the operation of comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function is currently not properly comparing the blocks within each `BlockManager`. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared in a way that considers their content and location to accurately identify if two `BlockManager` objects are equal.

Based on the provided information, the corrected version of the `equals` function to handle the comparison of `BlockManager` objects would be as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes additional sorting and comparison based on the values and locations of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, ensuring a proper comparison and accurate identification of equality.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output values should now be satisfied. Additionally, the GitHub issue related to the bug should be resolved.
