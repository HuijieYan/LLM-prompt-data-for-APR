The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method compares two `BlockManager` instances and returns True if they are equal and False if they are not.

The method seems to be failing when comparing two dataframes with different values. The comparison logic includes accessing the `axes`, number of blocks, and sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. However, the error message shows that the comparison has returned True when it should have been False.

One potential cause of the bug is within the sorting logic using the `canonicalize` function. It's possible that the sorting logic is not able to correctly differentiate between the blocks in different dataframes, leading to an incorrect comparison result.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `canonicalize` function is correctly distinguishing between the blocks. One approach to achieve this is by modifying the `canonicalize` function and ensuring that it generates a unique key for each block that can be used for sorting. Additionally, we should verify that the comparison logic in the `equals` method is correctly evaluating the sorted blocks for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block._unit_tuple)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function generates a key using the `block.dtype` and `block._unit_tuple` attributes to ensure uniqueness for sorting. The comparison logic in the last line of the method remains unchanged.

With these changes, the corrected `equals` method should be able to correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.
