The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class. This function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal.

The potential error in the function is that it is not considering the value of `items` parameter in the `as_array` function, which is called internally. This could lead to incorrect comparison of the axes and blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `as_array` function is not being called with the `items` parameter when comparing `self` and `other` axes.

To fix the bug, the `as_array` function should be called with the `items` parameter in the `equals` function. This ensures that the comparison takes into account any specified items.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array(items=self.items).tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `as_array` function is called with the `items` parameter specified, ensuring that the comparison takes into account any items that are provided.
