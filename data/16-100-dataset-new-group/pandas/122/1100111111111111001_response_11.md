Based on the provided information, the issue with the `equals` function appears to be related to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which includes the sorting of `mgr_locs`. It seems that the sorting logic is not consistent with the expected behavior, which leads to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be revised to ensure that the sorting of `mgr_locs` and the handling of block types are compatible with the comparison process in the `equals` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # define a new canonicalize function to properly sort and compare blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.indexers)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a adjusted `canonicalize` function that involves sorting based on the block type and `mgr_locs.indexers` to ensure consistent comparison of blocks. This adjustment should address the failing test case and result in the expected output.
