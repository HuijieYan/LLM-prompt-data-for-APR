## Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`.
- It compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks after sorting.

## Identified potential error locations:
- Incorrect comparison logic causing `df3.equals(df4)` to return True even when the blocks have different locations.

## Cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not properly handle the case where identical blocks have different locations due to the sorting mechanism used during comparison.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the comparison logic to handle identical blocks with different locations correctly, ensuring that the comparison considers the positions of the blocks.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly, including their locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I have removed the sorting of blocks and replaced it with a direct comparison of blocks, including their locations. This modification ensures that the comparison considers the positions of the blocks, fixing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
