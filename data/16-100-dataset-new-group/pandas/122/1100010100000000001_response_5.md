## Buggy Function Analysis:
This function is designed to check if two objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The function first checks if the number of axes is equal, then it checks if each axis is equal. It then consolidates the objects in place and compares the number of blocks. Finally, it sorts the blocks and compares each block for equality.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function might not correctly compare the axes of the two objects.
2. There could be issues with consolidating the objects in place.
3. Sorting and comparing the blocks might not yield the correct result.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in this function could be caused by incorrect comparison of axes or blocks, or issues related to consolidation and sorting.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison between axes and blocks is done accurately.
2. Verify that the consolidation and sorting processes are functioning as intended.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, we have changed the canonicalize function to use 'mgr_locs' and 'values' instead of 'dtype.name' for sorting the blocks. This change should ensure that the blocks are ordered and compared correctly.
