Based on the provided information, it seems that the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not working as expected and is causing the test to fail. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, and instead, it is returning `True`.

The GitHub issue also confirms this problem, stating that when calling `df3.equals(df4)`, the expected output is `False`, but the actual output is `True`.

The potential error location within the `equals` function seems to be in the comparison of the blocks using `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. It seems that the current comparison logic is not correctly identifying the differences between the blocks.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the `equals` comparison not correctly handling cases where the blocks have identical values but different locations. This leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` even when the blocks are not equal due to their different locations.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve revising the comparison logic within the `equals` function to properly handle cases where the blocks have identical values but different locations. This might involve a more comprehensive comparison strategy that takes into account block locations when checking for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Identify different blocks based on type and location
    def block_key(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_key)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, a new `block_key` function is defined to create a unique key for each block based on its type and location. These keys are then used to sort the blocks before performing the comparison. This approach should address the bug by properly handling cases where the blocks have identical values but different locations.
