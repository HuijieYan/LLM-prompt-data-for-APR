To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that when comparing blocks, we take into account both the data type and the locations of the blocks.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function for case 1, we can see that the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their data type and location. However, the code attempts to call this `canonicalize` function without providing the correct arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly call the `canonicalize` function and pass the `block` as an argument. This will ensure that we are considering both the data type and the location when comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # Call the mgr_locs method and convert to list

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have added the `()` to `as_array` to call the method, and we pass `block` as an argument to the `canonicalize` function to consider the data type and location of the blocks when sorting and comparing them. This should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now correctly compare blocks based on both their data type and location, therefore resolving the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
