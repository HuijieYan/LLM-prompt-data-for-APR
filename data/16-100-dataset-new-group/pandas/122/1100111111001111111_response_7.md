The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks which may have different locations, resulting in the `equals` function returning True even when the blocks are not equal. This issue has been raised on GitHub as "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

To fix the bug, the comparison in the `canonicalize` function should consider both the data type and the location of the blocks to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered as equal. Additionally, the `block` and `block.mgr_locs` variables need to be sorted before the comparison to achieve the correct results.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    # to consider both the type and location of the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return the expected result for the failing test case as well as resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
