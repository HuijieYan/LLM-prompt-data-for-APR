The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` in case of identical blocks with different locations. 

The cause of the bug is due to the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The use of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is problematic because `mgr_locs` is a set of locations of each block and does not capture the order of the elements within the block, resulting in incorrect sorting and comparison.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to consider the actual values within the block for proper comparison. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    # sort blocks based on column names and values 
    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: (block.items, block.values))
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: (block.items, block.values))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will compare the blocks based on both column names and values, ensuring a proper comparison and returning the correct result.

This updated version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
