The buggy function in the pandas library is the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue reported on GitHub is that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method does not consider the uniqueness of blocks based on their location. This results in the method returning True even for data frames with the same data but different block locations.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to consider the block locations. Additionally, the comparison logic should take into account the block locations to ensure consistent results.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and self_blocks[i].mgr_locs.equals(other_blocks[i].mgr_locs)
        for i, (block, oblock) in enumerate(zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method properly uses the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on data type and manager locations, ensuring that the method correctly differentiates between blocks with the same data but different locations. The corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
