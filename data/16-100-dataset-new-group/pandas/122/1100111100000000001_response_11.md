The buggy function named `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class. This function compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The bug may be occurring due to the sorting process of blocks and the comparison of those sorted blocks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
3. Comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

The cause of the bug is identified as the incorrect sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` due to which the function is not able to properly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves:
1. Correctly comparing the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function.
3. Comparing the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to determine their equality.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparisons and sorting have been revised to ensure that the function works as intended. Also, the `canonicalize` function now properly returns the sorted values based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()`.
