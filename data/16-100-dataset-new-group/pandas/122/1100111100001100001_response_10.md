The bug in the function appears to be related to the comparison of the blocks between 'self' and 'other'. The function sorts the blocks of 'self' and 'other' based on a 'canonicalize' key before comparing them.

However, the issue is that the 'canonicalize' function used in this comparison is defined within the 'equals' function itself, which makes it inaccessible when sorting 'other_blocks'. This may cause the blocks of 'self' and 'other' to be sorted differently, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, the 'canonicalize' function should be defined outside the 'equals' function so that it can be accessed when sorting 'other_blocks' as well. Additionally, the 'canonicalize' function should take both 'block' and 'other_block' as input parameters to ensure that the sorting is consistent for both sets of blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def canonicalize(block, mgr_locs):
    return (block.dtype.name, mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block, block.mgr_locs))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block, other.blocks[self.blocks.index(block)].mgr_locs))
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version, the 'canonicalize' function has been moved outside the 'equals' function and now takes both 'block' and 'mgr_locs' as input parameters. When sorting 'other_blocks', the 'canonicalize' function is used with the corresponding 'mgr_locs' to ensure that the blocks are sorted in a consistent manner for both 'self' and 'other'.
