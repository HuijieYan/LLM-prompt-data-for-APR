To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we should address the issue with block order and the `BlockManager` class. The problem is that the function fails to compare identical blocks with different locations correctly, so we need to update the behavior of the function to account for block locations.

In the given buggy function, we can see that the issue may arise from the sorting of blocks, as well as the comparison of block equality. The sorting is based on the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but this may not account for different locations of identical blocks.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to consider a different approach for comparing blocks. Instead of just sorting the blocks and comparing them directly, we can first check if the blocks have the same type and then compare their content. Additionally, we should also consider the specific location of each block.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block._get_sorted_index(len(self.axes))))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block._get_sorted_index(len(other.axes))))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we use the `_get_sorted_index` method to get the sorted index values for each block based on the length of axes. This approach ensures that we account for the specific locations of the blocks and compare their contents appropriately.

By considering the specific block locations during the comparison, this corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case.
