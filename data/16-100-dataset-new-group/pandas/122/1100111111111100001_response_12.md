The buggy function `equals()` is not functioning as intended and is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` to fail.

The issue arises from the comparison of two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals()` method. The function is designed to compare two BlockManager objects, not DataFrame objects, resulting in the failure.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals()` function to properly compare BlockManager objects, which are the underlying data structures of the DataFrame class.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals()` function will correctly compare two BlockManager objects, resolving the issue identified in the failing test.

This correction should ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` will now pass successfully.
