The buggy function `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` if not. The issue with the current implementation is that it is not comparing the blocks properly and returning incorrect results.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `equals()` method is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with different values.

Based on the provided GitHub issue, it is clear that the bug in the `equals()` method is causing it to return an incorrect result in certain cases.

To fix the bug:
- We need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks in both instances is done correctly.
- Additionally, the canonicalization process using the `canonicalize()` function does not seem to be working as intended and may need to be revised.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other methods...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Canonicalize blocks based on their data and locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.astype(str).tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this fixed version:
- The `canonicalize()` function now generates a unique identifier for blocks based on their data and locations.
- The blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize()` function before comparison to ensure a consistent order, allowing for correct comparison between two instances of `BlockManager`.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `equals()` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
