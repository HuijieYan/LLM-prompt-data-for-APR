The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test to fail, returning `True` instead of the expected `False`. The issue on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function is wrongly returning `True` in cases where identical blocks have different locations.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue is related to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The bug causes it to incorrectly identify identical blocks with different locations as different, resulting in a `True` (equals) return when it should be `False`.

To fix this bug, the function can be modified to sort the blocks by both the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` to ensure that identical blocks are correctly identified, regardless of their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly identify identical blocks, regardless of their locations, and return the expected `False` for the failing test case.
