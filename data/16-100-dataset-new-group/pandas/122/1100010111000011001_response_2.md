The buggy function 'equals' is comparing two dataframes using their axes and blocks attributes. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks.

The issue arises due to the comparison of blocks not being handled properly. It seems that the sorting and comparison of blocks are not done correctly, leading to inconsistent results.

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks needs to be revised to ensure that it properly handles the sorting and comparison of blocks.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the 'canonicalize' function now correctly returns a tuple of the block's dtype and mgr_locs, and the 'sorted' function sorts the blocks based on this canonical representation. Then, the comparison should yield the expected result for the failing test case.
