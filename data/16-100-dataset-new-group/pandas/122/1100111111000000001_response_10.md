The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not properly comparing two dataframes and returning the correct result. This can be identified from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` where it is expected that `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`, but the buggy function is not returning the correct result.

The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not handling the comparison of dataframes correctly, which leads to the incorrect result.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not properly handling the comparison of the dataframes. It is not taking into account the content of the dataframes and only checking the length and axes, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be modified to properly compare the content of the dataframes, not just the length and axes. It should iterate through the blocks of both dataframes and compare them individually.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
            
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly compare the content of the dataframes and return the correct result. Therefore, it should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
