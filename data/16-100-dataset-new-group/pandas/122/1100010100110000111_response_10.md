The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return incorrect values for dataframes with identical blocks but different locations. This results in the function returning `True` instead of `False` as expected. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to properly handle dataframes with identical blocks but different locations. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include 'mgr_locs' in the tuple combination to distinguish unconsolidated blocks. This will ensure that the function can correctly identify and compare identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs to distinguish unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly compare dataframes with identical blocks but different locations, and the failing test case should pass.
