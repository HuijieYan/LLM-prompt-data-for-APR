The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `Pandas` library. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are where it compares blocks using the `equals` method and where it sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not take into account the block locations when comparing DataFrames. Therefore, it incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the comparison of blocks and to use this modified function for sorting the blocks. Additionally, the function should consider the block locations when comparing the blocks using the `equals` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock, self.blocks.index(block), other.blocks.index(oblock)) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `equals` function includes the block locations in the comparison by passing the indices of the blocks to the `equals` method. This modification ensures that the function correctly compares DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations and returns the expected output.
