## Analysis
The failing test case provides two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, with different data types in corresponding columns. The buggy function `equals` is called, and it wrongly returns `True` when it should have returned `False`. 

When execution reaches the buggy function's return, it seems that the `canonicalize` function is correctly determining that `df1` and `df2` are equal when, in fact, they are not.

The problem seems to be that the `canonicalize` function is incorrectly sorting the blocks within each DataFrame, causing the comparison to return `True` erroneously.

## Bug Cause
The bug's cause appears to be the incorrect sorting of blocks within the DataFrames `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` key.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the specific order of the blocks and the data type within the blocks. We also need to update the `equals` function to correctly compare the sorted block lists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, repr(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we update the `canonicalize` function to use `type(block).__name__` and `repr(block)` as the sorting key to consider data type and block order. Then, we sort the two block lists and compare them using the `equals` method for each block.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test case now passes.
