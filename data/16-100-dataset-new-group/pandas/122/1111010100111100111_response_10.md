### Bug Fix

#### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is not correctly identifying when two `BlockManager` instances are not equal. This results in the erroneous assertion failure in the failing test.

The bug is likely to be caused by the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent comparison between sorted `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The bug appears to be missing the comparison for the `mgr_locs` values, which are crucial for determining the equality of blocks.

#### Bug cause:
The bug is caused by the failure to consider `mgr_locs` in the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the `equals` function.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
Update the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` values and modify the comparison of the block instances to consider the sorted `mgr_locs` as well.

#### Updated Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the dtype, mgr_locs, and then dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name, 
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), 
            block.mgr_locs
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this updated function, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test should pass as expected.
