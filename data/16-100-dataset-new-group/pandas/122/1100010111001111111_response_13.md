The issue is caused by the `equals` function incorrectly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is due to the sorting process of the blocks in the function, which causes identical blocks with different locations to be considered equal.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function and the sorting process in the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function should consider the index information of the blocks to differentiate them. We'll update it to include both the type name and the block's index. In the `equals` function, we'll use a modified `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize block order to include index information
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.index)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the issue reported in GitHub should be resolved, and the `equals` function should now return `False` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, as expected.
