Based on the information provided, let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code, and the GitHub issue.

1. The buggy function is part of the pandas package and is meant to compare two objects for equality. The related test code tests the buggy function by creating two DataFrames with different values and asserting that the buggy function should return False. The GitHub issue reports that the buggy function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
   a. Comparing the length of 'self_axes' and 'other_axes' and returning False if they are not equal.
   b. Calling the '_consolidate_inplace' method for both self and other objects.
   c. Sorting the 'self_blocks' and 'other_blocks' and then iterating through them to check equality.

3. Cause of the bug:
   The bug in the 'equals' function arises from the fact that it fails to take into account the block locations when comparing objects. This results in incorrect equality comparison, as reported in the GitHub issue, where the two DataFrames should not be equal but erroneously return True.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   To fix the bug, the 'equals' function needs to consider the block locations when comparing objects. The equality comparison should involve checking both the length of axes and the block locations to ensure a correct comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    # Check block locations
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Consider block locations for comparison
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and np.array_equal(block.mgr_locs, oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By adding a check for block locations in the comparison, the corrected version of the 'equals' function addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should pass the failing test. This ensures that the equality comparison takes into account both the axes and block locations for a correct comparison.
