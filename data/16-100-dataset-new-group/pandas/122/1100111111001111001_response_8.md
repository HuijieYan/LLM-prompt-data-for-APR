The bug in the function "equals" lies in the canonicalization of the block. The function is attempting to sort the blocks in the "BlockManager" object by creating a tuple with the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. The problem arises when the mgr_locs value is turned into a list using the ".as_array.tolist()" method. The correct way to access the mgr_locs values is by using ".mgr_locs" directly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the "canonicalize" function within the "equals" function and update the references to "mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()" to ".mgr_locs" instead.

Here's the corrected version of the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the "equals" function should now function as expected and pass the failing test.
