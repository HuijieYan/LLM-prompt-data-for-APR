The bug in the equals function is causing it to fail. The function is intended to compare two BlockManager objects to check if they are equal, but it is not handling the comparison correctly.

The main issue in the buggy function is that it is not properly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects. The comparison logic is flawed and is not considering the actual contents of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic should be revised to compare the contents of the blocks within the BlockManager objects.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function now iterates through the blocks of both BlockManager objects and compares each individual block using the `equals` method. This provides a more accurate comparison of the contents of the BlockManager objects and should resolve the failing test case.
