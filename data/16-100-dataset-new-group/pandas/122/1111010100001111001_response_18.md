The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function is not correctly comparing the blocks between the two instances of `BlockManager`. It is likely that the sorting logic inside the `canonicalize` function is not working as expected or that the `equals` method for the `block` objects is not implemented correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly and consistently to guarantee that the `equals` function returns the expected result based on the content of the `BlockManager` objects.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # sort and compare the blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.get_values_dtype()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.get_values_dtype()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the sorting of blocks is based on the `mgr_locs` and the data type of the block. We also assume that the `get_values_dtype` method returns the data type of the block.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result based on the comparison of `BlockManager` instances.
