## Fixing the bug

The bug is likely to be located in the `equals` function, since it is the only custom function in the provided code. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects and their blocks for equality. The runtime input/output values and expected input/output values will help us trace and fix the bug.

The bug is likely causing the failing test since it expects the two `DataFrame` objects to be unequal, but the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

An issue causing the bug could be the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` objects, which might be related to the order in which the blocks are sorted and compared.

One strategy for fixing the bug could be to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared in a way that guarantees consistent behavior and comparison of the blocks. This can be achieved by using a unique identifier for each block and comparing the blocks based on these identifiers.

## Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Ensure consistent comparison of blocks
    def get_block_identifier(block):
        return (block.shape, block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_identifier)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_identifier)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared based on a unique identifier for each block, which should resolve the issue causing the failing test.
