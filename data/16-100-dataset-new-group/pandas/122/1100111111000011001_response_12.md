The bug in the 'equals' function may be due to the sorting of blocks based on 'canonicalize' function and the comparison of blocks using 'equals' method. It seems that the 'canonicalize' function is missing the 'self' parameter which should be there to take the 'self' object into account. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks using the 'equals' method should be thoroughly tested to ensure it correctly identifies differences between blocks.

To fix the bug, the 'canonicalize' function should take 'self' as a parameter and the comparison of blocks using the 'equals' method should be updated to handle any potential inconsistencies between block types. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(other, block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the canonicalization of blocks and the comparison of blocks using the 'equals' method. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
