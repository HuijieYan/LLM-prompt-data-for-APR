The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return an incorrect result when comparing two BlockManager instances. Based on the provided runtime and expected values, the issue seems to stem from the `equals` method failing to compare the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` objects.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` method properly compares the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` objects to determine if they are the same.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added the check for `block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)` within the `all` function to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is properly compared during the equals operation. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function returns the correct result when comparing BlockManager instances.
