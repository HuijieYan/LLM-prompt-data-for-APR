The provided buggy function is `equals(self, other)`. This function is designed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class and return `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise.

Upon analysis, the bug in the function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks and their locations. The function should compare the blocks and their locations in a different manner to address the reported issue on GitHub. The bug is causing the `equals` function to return incorrect results when checking the equality of identical blocks with different locations.

The buggy function fails to correct compare the blocks and their locations, resulting in an incorrect return value when comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. To fix this bug, the function should consider the block locations while comparing the blocks to ensure accurate equality comparisons.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check for equality of each block and its location
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        self_block, other_block = self.blocks[i], other.blocks[i]
        self_block_locs = self_block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        other_block_locs = other_block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        if self_block.dtype.name != other_block.dtype.name or self_block_locs != other_block_locs:
            return False

        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks for the equality of the axes. If the axes are not equal, it returns `False`. Then, it consolidates both `BlockManager` instances and compares the blocks and their locations. If any of the comparisons fail, it returns `False`. If all comparisons pass, it returns `True`, indicating that the instances are equal.

This corrected version should address the reported bug on GitHub and accurately compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
