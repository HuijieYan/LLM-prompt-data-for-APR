The issue here is that the `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations. This leads to failing test cases and an issue on GitHub. Let's analyze the potential errors in the buggy function and then provide a corrected version.

### Potential Errors in the Buggy Function
1. The function is not correctly identifying the equality of axes between the two DataFrames.
2. Calling the `_consolidate_inplace` method for both `self` and `other` before checking the equality of blocks.
3. The `canonicalize` function could be incorrectly ordering the blocks.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs when the function is comparing the `self` and `other` DataFrames. It is not properly identifying the equality of axes and is incorrectly ordering the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the equality of axes between the two DataFrames first.
2. Remove the unnecessary calls to `_consolidate_inplace` before comparing the blocks.
3. Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly order the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the block's type name and block key
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks the equality of axes and then proceeds to compare the blocks, taking into account their type and locations to correctly order them for comparison. It also removes the unnecessary calls to `_consolidate_inplace` before comparing the blocks.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
