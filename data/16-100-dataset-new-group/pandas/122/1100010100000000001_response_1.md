The buggy function "equals" is used for comparing two objects. The potential error locations within the function include:
1. The comparison of the lengths of self_axes and other_axes might not consider all cases, leading to a potential bug.
2. The comparison of the lengths of self.blocks and other.blocks might not consider all cases, leading to a potential bug.
3. The sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks might not handle all scenarios, leading to a potential bug.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle all possible scenarios for comparisons and sorting, which could result in incorrect equality checks.

To fix the bug, we can revise the function to handle all possible edge cases for comparisons and sorting.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate inplace for proper comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have addressed the potential error locations and added comments for better clarity. Additionally, we have added a consolidation step before comparison to ensure proper comparison.
