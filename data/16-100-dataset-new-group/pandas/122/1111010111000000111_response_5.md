The buggy `equals()` function is part of the `BlockManager` class within the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This function checks whether two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" indicates that the `equals()` function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, which is causing a failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparisons of axes and blocks, as well as the canonicalization of block order. It seems that the bug is occurring because the function does not account for different block locations when comparing the blocks.

To fix the bug, the `equals()` function needs to be modified to consider the block locations when comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks using the canonicalized order
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals()` function should now correctly account for different block locations when comparing `BlockManager` objects. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
