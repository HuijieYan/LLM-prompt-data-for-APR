### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is not properly handling the comparison of data frames with identical blocks but different locations, leading to a False assertion failure.
2. The failing test is checking if `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`, but the assertion fails due to discrepancies in block locations.
3. The issue is due to the `canonicalize` function not properly handling block locations in the comparison.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would involve updating the `canonicalize` function to consider only the block content and ignore the block locations.

### Corrections:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function to ignore block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block._box_item_values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above correction, the `canonicalize` function now only considers block values and item values, ignoring block locations. This will address the issue with equal comparison returning False for data frames with identical blocks but different locations.
