To correct the buggy function, we need to address the issue described. The problem is that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

In the buggy function, the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks by block type and location. However, this sorting method does not consider the actual values of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to also include the block values in the sorting criteria. This way, identical blocks with different locations will not be incorrectly marked as equal.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, when comparing blocks within the DataFrames, the function will also consider the values of the blocks in addition to their type and location. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly marked as equal.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in GitHub.
