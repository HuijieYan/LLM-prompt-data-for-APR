The bug in the equals function arises from the comparison of the two dataframes df1 and df2. The function compares the axes of the two dataframes, then calls the _consolidate_inplace function on both dataframes. It then compares the number of blocks in each dataframe and sorts the blocks to compare them.

One potential cause of the bug is that the comparison between the axes might not be sufficient to determine the equality of the dataframes. Additionally, the _consolidate_inplace function may not be properly dealing with the internal data structures. Lastly, there may be an issue with the sorting of the blocks for comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to enhance the comparison mechanism and ensure that the dataframe structures are properly dealt with.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and
        block.mgr_locs.indexer.equals(oblock.mgr_locs.indexer)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
After making this change, the corrected equals function will properly check for the equality of the two dataframes by comparing the axes and the values within the blocks.
