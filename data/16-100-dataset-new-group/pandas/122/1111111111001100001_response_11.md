The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, where the comparison between two sets of blocks is not being performed correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is not taking into consideration the actual block values, resulting in a false negative when comparing two similar DataFrames.

To fix the bug, the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` needs to be adjusted to consider the actual block values.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the block values and pass the failing test.
