The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.

The issue is caused by the `equals` method wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, when it should be returning `False`. This is due to improper comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to use block values for comparison instead of block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and block values for proper comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description by properly comparing identical blocks with different locations and returning the expected result.
