Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class. The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations, which is not the expected behavior.

Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic in the `equals` function might not be properly identifying identical blocks with different locations.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might not be handling unconsolidated blocks correctly.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the method incorrectly identifying identical blocks with different locations as equal. This leads to the `equals` method returning True when it should return False.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `equals` function to correctly handle identical blocks with different locations. Additionally, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should consider unconsolidated blocks to ensure accurate comparison.

Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array)  # Use values instead of dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` function uses values instead of dtype.name for canonicalization and also considers mgr_locs for unconsolidated blocks, ensuring a more accurate comparison and addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
