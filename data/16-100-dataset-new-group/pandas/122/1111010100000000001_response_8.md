The buggy function 'equals' compares two BlockManager instances for equality. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The function compares the number of axes and the individual axes of the BlockManagers, but it does not compare the shape of the BlockManagers.
2. The function compares the length of the blocks in the BlockManagers, but it does not compare the content of the blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the function only checks the number of axes and the length of the blocks, without ensuring that the content and shape of the BlockManagers are equal.

To fix the bug, the 'equals' function should compare the shape of the BlockManagers and the content of the blocks to ensure that both instances are identical.

Here's the corrected version of the 'equals' function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        if self.shape != other.shape:  # Compare the shape of the BlockManagers
            return False
            
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare the content of the blocks
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
            if not self_block.equals(other_block):
                return False

        return True
```
