The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames `self` and `other`. The error message indicates that the comparison results in `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparisons of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, as well as the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. Additionally, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might not be consistent.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the comparison of the DataFrames. The comparison of the DataFrames is resulting in `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function compares the DataFrames element-wise and handles the sorting consistently.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtypes.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.to_pandas().values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtypes.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.to_pandas().values))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self_axes` and `other_axes` are compared first. Then, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is done consistently by using lambda functions. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
