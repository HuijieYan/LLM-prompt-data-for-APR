The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect comparison of blocks. The comparison logic is incorrect and needs to be addressed to fix the bug.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the `BlockManager` class and again outside the class. This can lead to ambiguity and erroneous behavior when sorting the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `canonicalize` function defined outside the class and update the implementation of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on the type and manager locations
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, str(x.mgr_locs)))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, str(x.mgr_locs)))

    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This implementation addresses the bug by properly sorting the blocks based on their type and manager locations and then comparing them to determine equality.

With the above correction, the failing test should now pass.
