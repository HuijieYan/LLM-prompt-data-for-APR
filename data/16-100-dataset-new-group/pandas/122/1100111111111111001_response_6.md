The bug in the function `equals` is that it sorts `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function which is defined in both the `BlockManager` class and outside of it. This can lead to confusion and unexpected sorting. Additionally, it appears that the `canonicalize` function is not properly implemented and may not be returning the correct values.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks in a straightforward manner, rather than relying on a custom sorting mechanism.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this modification, the `equals` function compares the blocks directly without using the `canonicalize` function, ensuring a correct comparison. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
