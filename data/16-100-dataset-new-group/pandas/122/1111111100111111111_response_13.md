To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the incorrect comparison of the two dataframes.

The current implementation of the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the dataframes. It fails to acknowledge the different locations of identical blocks within the dataframes due to a bug in the way block order is canonicalized. This leads to an incorrect assertion that the two dataframes are equal, resulting in the test failure.

To resolve this issue, we need to update the `equals` function to properly compare the dataframes and account for the different block locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False

    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Ensure that blocks are consolidated before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def get_sorted_blocks(manager):
        return sorted(manager.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_sorted_blocks = get_sorted_blocks(self)
    other_sorted_blocks = get_sorted_blocks(other)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that both dataframes are consolidated before comparison using the `_consolidate_inplace` method. Then, we sort and compare the blocks based on both dtype and mgr_locs to properly account for different block locations.

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should be able to correctly identify the dataframes as unequal when the block locations are different, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
