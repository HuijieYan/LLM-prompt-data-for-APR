The buggy function is comparing two BlockManager objects to check if they are equal. It first compares the axes of the two objects, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares the blocks within the two objects.

The bug occurs in the comparison of the blocks, where the function calls the `canonicalize` function to sort and compare the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. However, there is an issue with the `canonicalize` function definition within the function, as it should be part of the `BlockManager` class but is instead defined inside the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, we need to move the `canonicalize` function outside of the `equals` function and define it as a standalone function that takes a `block` as input and returns a tuple. This will allow it to be used by the `equals` function for sorting and comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
#... (other functions from the same file)

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    #... (other functions from the same class)
    
    # Move the canonicalize function outside of the equals function and define it as a standalone function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # Sort blocks using the canonicalize function
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the function will properly compare the two BlockManager objects based on their axes and sorted blocks, resolving the failing test case.
