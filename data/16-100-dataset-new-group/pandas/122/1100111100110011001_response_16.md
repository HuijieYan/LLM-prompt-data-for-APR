The bug in the provided function is that it calls the `equals` method of the block class without passing the `other` object as an argument, which causes the comparison to be made against the wrong object.

To fix this bug, the `equals` method of the block class should explicitly take the `other` object as an argument when calling the `equals` method.

Additionally, the `canonicalize` function is defined twice for the `BlockManager` class, and the correct reference to it should be used.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions)

    # this is the buggy function fixed
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By explicitly passing `other` as an argument to the `equals` method of the block class and using the correct reference to the `canonicalize` function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now pass the failing test case.
