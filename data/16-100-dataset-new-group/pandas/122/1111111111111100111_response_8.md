## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the incorrect comparison of blocks in different locations within the `BlockManager`. The function incorrectly returns True when it should return False. This behavior is likely caused by the `canonicalize` method used to sort and compare the blocks, which does not properly account for blocks with the same type but different locations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, the `canonicalize` method should be modified to account for blocks with the same type but different locations. Additionally, the comparison logic should be updated to correctly compare the sorted blocks. 

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` method is updated to include the block locations (`block.mgr_locs`) in the sorting key. Additionally, the sorting and comparison logic is updated to correctly compare the sorted blocks.

With these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly identify when two `BlockManager` instances are not equal, resolving the bug.
