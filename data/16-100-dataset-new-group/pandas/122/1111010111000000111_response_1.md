The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not functioning as expected. It is causing the `equals` method for DataFrame to wrongly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations, when it should return False. This bug is indicated by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `test_internals.py` and is also reported on GitHub in issue #28839.

The cause of the bug lies in the comparison of blocks between two DataFrames. The comparison method is not properly handling the case when blocks have the same data but different locations. This leads to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `equals` method to properly compare the blocks, taking into account their order and location.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # comparing blocks by checking their content
    for blkno, (block, oblock) in enumerate(zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(block.mgr_locs.as_array, oblock.mgr_locs.as_array):
            return False

    return True
```

With this modification, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the blocks in the BlockManager and return the expected results for the DataFrame comparison.
