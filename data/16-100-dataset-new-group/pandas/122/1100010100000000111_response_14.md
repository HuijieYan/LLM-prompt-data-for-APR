The buggy function `equals` is part of the `pandas` package and is responsible for comparing two dataframes to check if they are equal. The issue reported in GitHub indicates that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

From the code and the issue description, it seems that the bug occurs when comparing dataframes `df3` and `df4`. The expected output is False, but the `equals` function returns True.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` function, which might change the expected order.
2. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the comparison of blocks so that it considers block locations. Additionally, sorting the blocks based on their locations may help in ensuring the correct comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and (block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple consisting of the block's type name and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, the comparison of blocks now includes a check for their locations to ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are not considered equal.
