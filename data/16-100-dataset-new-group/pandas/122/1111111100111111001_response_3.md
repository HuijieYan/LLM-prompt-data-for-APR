The bug is likely caused by the sorting of self.blocks and other.blocks, as the error message indicates that the comparison of the sorted blocks is incorrect.

In the buggy function, the sorting of self.blocks and other.blocks is done using the `canonicalize` function. However, the `canonicalize` function is not defined correctly and is not called with the correct arguments.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be defined correctly and called with the appropriate arguments to sort the blocks in a meaningful way for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is defined to take a `block` as input and create a tuple of the string representation of the block's dtype and values. This ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their data type and values, allowing for a meaningful comparison.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
