### Bug Explanation
The `equals` function is meant to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class to check if they are equal. However, the comparison logic seems to be flawed, as it is failing the test cases. 

Looking at the failing test case, it seems that the actual response is `True` instead of `False`, which is incorrect. This indicates that the comparison logic inside the `equals` function is not working as expected.

The cause of the bug could be due to the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. This might not be correctly handling the comparison of blocks and their content.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks and their content within the `equals` function is done accurately. Additionally, the comparison logic for axis and block lengths needs to be accurate to determine if the `BlockManager` instances are equal.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Ensure that blocks have been consolidated before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, I have made sure that `consolidate_inplace` is called on both `self` and `other` instances before the comparison. Additionally, I have updated the `canonicalize` function to use the block's `dtype` directly, and also added comparison for the `mgr_locs` attribute. This should ensure that the blocks are properly sorted and compared.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
