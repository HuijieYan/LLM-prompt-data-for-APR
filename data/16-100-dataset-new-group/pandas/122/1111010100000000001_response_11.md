The buggy function is `equals` and it is a method of the `BlockManager` class. The purpose of the `equals` function is to compare two `BlockManager` objects to check whether they are equal or not. 

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Missing attribute `blocks` in the `BlockManager` class, causing potential errors when accessing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not handle the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` correctly. Also, the `blocks` attribute is not defined in the `BlockManager` class, so calling `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` will lead to attribute errors.

To fix the bug, the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` should be modified to handle potential differences in the lengths of axes. Additionally, the `blocks` attribute needs to be defined in the `BlockManager` class to avoid attribute errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Check if the `blocks` attribute is available in the `BlockManager` class
    if not hasattr(self, 'blocks') or not hasattr(other, 'blocks'):
        return NotImplemented
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for the existence of the `blocks` attribute in the `BlockManager` class, and the comparison of axes has been improved to handle differences in length. Additionally, we have addressed the potential attribute access errors by including a check for the existence of the `blocks` attribute before accessing it.
