The bug in the equals function is causing it to return True instead of False when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, as reported in GitHub issue GH28839.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks based on the canonicalize function, which may not properly distinguish unconsolidated blocks with identical content but different locations.

The buggy function fails to properly handle cases where two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect True return from the equals function when it should actually return False.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be modified to account for the distinction between unconsolidated blocks with identical content but different locations. Additionally, the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks based on the canonicalize function should accurately reflect these distinctions.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining content, type names, and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the equals function should now properly handle cases where two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations and return False as expected for the failing test. This also resolves the issue reported in GitHub.
