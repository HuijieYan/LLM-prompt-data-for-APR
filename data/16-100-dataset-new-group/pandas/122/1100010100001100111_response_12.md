## Potential error locations within the buggy function

One potential error location within the buggy function is the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks. The bug may be related to how the blocks are sorted and compared for equality.

## Cause of the bug

The bug seems to be caused by the sorting and comparison of blocks within the `canonicalize` function. The current implementation may not be correctly handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

The bug can be fixed by modifying the sorting and comparison process for the blocks within the `canonicalize` function.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # create a set of canonical representation of the blocks using their contents
    self_blocks_set = {tuple(block.values) for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks_set = {tuple(block.values) for block in other.blocks}

    return self_blocks_set == other_blocks_set
```
