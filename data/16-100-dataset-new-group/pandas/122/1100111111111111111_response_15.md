The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library occurs because the blocks are being sorted based on the `canonicalize` function, which is defined twice in the class. This leads to ambiguous calls to the `canonicalize` function and incorrect block ordering, causing the `equals` function to return the wrong result.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function in the `BlockManager` class and ensure that the blocks are sorted based on a single, unambiguous definition of `canonicalize`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Single definition of canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring a single, unambiguous definition of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function, we avoid the ambiguity and incorrect block ordering that caused the bug. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
