The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in different locations within the data frames. The issue posted on GitHub describes how the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations. This means that the comparison is not correctly taking into account the block locations, resulting in incorrect equality evaluations.

The `equals` method compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. It first compares the axes of the two objects to ensure they have the same length and contents. Then it consolidates the two objects in place before comparing their blocks. However, the bug arises from the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which does not properly consider the block locations.

To fix the bug, the sorting of the blocks should take into account not just the block data, but also their location. This would ensure that the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects is considered during the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The key change in the corrected version is the modification of the `canonicalize` function. It now considers both the `mgr_locs` (block locations) and the `values` of the blocks when creating the sorting key for the blocks. This ensures that blocks with different locations will not be mistakenly considered equal.

With these changes, the `equals` method should now accurately compare `BlockManager` objects and correctly identify cases where the blocks have different locations.
