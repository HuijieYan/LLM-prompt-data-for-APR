The buggy function `equals` is not correctly identifying when two DataFrames are not equal due to identical blocks with different locations. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is failing with the error `assert True is False`, indicating that the `equals` function is returning True when it should be False.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not account for the different block locations in the DataFrames, causing it to incorrectly return True when comparing identical blocks in different locations.

To fix the bug, we should update the `equals` function to consider the different block locations when comparing the DataFrames.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version includes the `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function to consider the block values and their locations when comparing the DataFrames, ensuring that the `equals` function correctly identifies when the DataFrames are not equal due to identical blocks with different locations.
