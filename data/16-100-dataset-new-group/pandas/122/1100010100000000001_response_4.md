## Potential Error Locations and Causes:
1. The function is trying to compare two objects (self and other) for equality.
2. The function is performing several checks and comparisons.
3. There may be a potential bug in the comparison process or in the sorting and canonicalization of the blocks.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug may occur due to the canonicalization and sorting of blocks. If there are unconsolidated blocks (e.g., Categorical) that can only be distinguished by the iteration order, the sorting and canonicalization may not accurately determine the equality of the blocks.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the canonicalization process needs to be revised. Instead of relying solely on the type name and manager locations for sorting, a more comprehensive approach to differentiate between unconsolidated blocks should be implemented.


## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and other relevant properties
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values_hash(), block._can_compare_with_block(other))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
