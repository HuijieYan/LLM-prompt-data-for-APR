The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` does not hold true.

By analyzing the inputs and outputs of the buggy function, it can be identified that the issue lies in the comparison of dataframes `df1` and `df2`. The problem arises from the fact that the function compares the elements of `df1` and `df2` directly without considering the data types of the elements, leading to the incorrect assertion.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to also compare the data types of the elements of `df1` and `df2`. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account both the values and the data types.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.dtype == oblock.dtype for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now also compares the data types of the blocks in `df1` and `df2`, ensuring a more accurate comparison.

After applying this fix to the buggy function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any issues.
