Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug in the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas.core.internals.managers` file causes the test_dataframe_not_equal test to fail. The test expects the `df1.equals(df2)` expression to return `False`, but it is likely returning `True` due to the bug.

The bug appears to be in the canonicalization and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` within the `equals` function. The bug causes the function to return `True` when it should return `False` for the given test case.

The bug is related to the incorrect order of the blocks during comparison. The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted in the function based on a canonicalization mechanism to compare the blocks. However, the current canonicalization mechanism does not produce the expected results, leading to the incorrect comparison.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization mechanism needs to be adjusted to accurately compare the blocks in `self` and `other`. Specifically, the way the blocks are being sorted needs to be revised to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal. Additionally, the comparison logic itself may need to be updated to address the issue of identical blocks with different locations.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function, taking into account the adjustment to the canonicalization mechanism:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The updated `equals` function includes a revised `canonicalize` function and a different sorting mechanism for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. This should address the issue of identical blocks with different locations erroneously being considered as equal, and the corrected version is expected to resolve the problem mentioned in the GitHub issue.
