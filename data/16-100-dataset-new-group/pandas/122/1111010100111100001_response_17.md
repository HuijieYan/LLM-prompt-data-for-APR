To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. The function should compare the shape of the blocks and then check for equality of the values within the blocks.

Additionally, we should handle the case where the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are different.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for i, (block1, block2) in enumerate(zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected function ensures that the comparison of blocks is performed correctly, and handles the case where the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are different.

Upon using the corrected function, the failing test should pass.

Note: The corrected function assumes that the `Block` class has an `equals` method that compares the values within the blocks for equality. If such a method is not available, it would need to be implemented in the `Block` class.
