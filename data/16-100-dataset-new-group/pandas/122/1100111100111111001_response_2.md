The issue with the buggy function `equals` is that it does not properly compare the blocks of two BlockManagers. The most likely cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly sorts and compares the blocks when they are not in the expected order due to differing dtype.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on their dtype and manager locations before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first define a `canonicalize` function that determines the order of blocks based on their dtype and manager locations. Then, we sort the blocks of both self and other BlockManagers using this canonicalization. This ensures that the blocks are sorted consistently, allowing for a proper comparison.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
