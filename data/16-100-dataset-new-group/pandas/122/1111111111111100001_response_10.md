The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not properly comparing `self` and `other` objects, leading to failed tests.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not be accurate, causing the function to return invalid results.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function may not be correct.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the internal components of `self` and `other`. This results in the function returning `True` in cases where it should return `False`, leading to failed tests.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to be reviewed to ensure that it accurately compares the internal components of `self` and `other`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now accurately compare the internal components of `self` and `other`, and the failing test should pass.
