The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test. The `equals` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances and check if they are equal. The bug seems to be related to comparing the values within the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances.

The error message indicates that the comparison `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, causing an AssertionError.

The bug in the code is likely due to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances not being performed correctly.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks should be revised to ensure that the contents of the blocks are properly compared.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # We will update the canonicalize function to compare the actual values within the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tolist()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the sorted blocks with their values
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is updated to compare the actual values within the blocks. Then, the sorted blocks' values are compared using NumPy's `array_equal` function to ensure that the contents of the blocks are properly compared. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
