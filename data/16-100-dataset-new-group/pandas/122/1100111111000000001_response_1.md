The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file in the pandas library is trying to compare two dataframes for equality, but it is failing for certain cases, as shown in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The function `canonicalize` is defined twice, once outside the class and once inside the class, which may lead to confusion and unexpected behavior.
2. Sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function may not result in the expected order for comparison.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the comparison of dataframes with different column types correctly. This leads to the `equals` function returning `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle dataframes with different column types correctly. This may involve sorting and comparing the dataframes in a more robust way, taking into account the column types and values for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for sb, ob in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not sb.equals(ob):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare dataframes and pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file.
