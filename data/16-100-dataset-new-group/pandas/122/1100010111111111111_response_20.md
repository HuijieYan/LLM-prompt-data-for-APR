The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return True when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function, used to sort the blocks, does not take into account the block locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function so that it considers the block locations when sorting the blocks. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal, thereby resolving the issue and causing the failing test to pass.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and shape because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks which can only be distinguished by these attributes
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.shape)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
