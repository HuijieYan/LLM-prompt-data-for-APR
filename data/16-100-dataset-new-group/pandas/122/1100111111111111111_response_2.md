## Correction:

The issue here seems to be related to the sorting of the blocks which may lead to incorrect comparison results. To fix this bug, we need to properly compare the blocks by sorting them based on their type and location within the dataframe.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly compare the blocks within the dataframes and return the expected result. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
