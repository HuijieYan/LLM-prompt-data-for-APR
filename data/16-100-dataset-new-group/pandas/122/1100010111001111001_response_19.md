The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManager objects `self` and `other` to check if they are equal. However, due to an incorrect ordering of the blocks, the comparison is failing.

The bug is occurring when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The sorting is not performing correctly, leading to a mismatch in the blocks for comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before the comparison. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to properly order the blocks before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.items  # new addition to sort by items
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding `block.items` to the tuple returned by the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their items, which should correct the bug and make the function pass the failing test.

With this fix, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case provided.
