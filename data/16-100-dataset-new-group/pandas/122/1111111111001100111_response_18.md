Based on the information provided, the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `equals` method of the DataFrame to wrongly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations. The bug seems to be occurring when comparing the blocks of two DataFrames in the `equals` method.

The cause of the bug can be identified from the values of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The bug may be related to the way the blocks are being compared and sorted. Additionally, the use of the `_consolidate_inplace` function in the comparison process may be affecting the comparison result.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to enhance the canonicalization process of the blocks before comparison. This process may involve creating a more comprehensive approach to comparing and sorting the blocks to ensure the accurate determination of equality.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_blocks = [(block.dtype.name, block.values) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.dtype.name, block.values) for block in other.blocks]
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` function compares the blocks directly based on their dtype name and values, which should provide a more accurate determination of equality. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes.
