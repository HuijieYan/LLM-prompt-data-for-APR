```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (previous class code)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The bug is fixed by ensuring that both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted and compared correctly using the `equals()` method, as well as consolidating both `self` and `other` before comparing their blocks. This will ensure that unconsolidated blocks do not affect the comparison.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
