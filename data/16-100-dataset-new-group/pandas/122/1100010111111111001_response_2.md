The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of two DataFrames, `self` and `other`. When the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2`, it expects them to be different. However, the `equals` function is not returning the expected value, causing the test to fail.

The issue may be due to the fact that the function is not comparing the DataFrame contents correctly, particularly with the order of the data. The function sorts the blocks in `self` and `other`, but it does not reflect the actual content of the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, a better approach would be to compare the actual values within the DataFrames, rather than their internal block structures.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    return self.equals(other)
```

This corrected version simply returns the result of calling the DataFrame's own `equals` method, which should correctly compare the DataFrame contents. This should resolve the bug and cause the failing test to pass. However, the expected behavior of the `equals` method may depend on the specific requirements of the DataFrame comparison in the context of the larger application. Additional logic may be required to fully meet those requirements.
