The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug is likely caused by the comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks without considering their order. This can lead to the function incorrectly returning True when the blocks have the same content but different positions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly handle the comparison of blocks. We can sort the blocks based on their content and then compare them to ensure that the order of the blocks does not affect the result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on their content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `equals` function should now properly handle the comparison of the blocks and return the correct result, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
