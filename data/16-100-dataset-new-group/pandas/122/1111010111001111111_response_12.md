The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class causes it to return `True` in cases where the blocks have different locations, but are otherwise identical. This leads to failed tests, as in the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function, where two DataFrames are expected to be unequal but are erroneously identified as equal.

To resolve this issue, the `equals` function should compare the contents of the blocks in both `self` and `other` using block labels and locations, ensuring they are in the same order and have the same values.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on labels and locations
    for block_label, self_block in self.blocks.items():
        if block_label not in other.blocks:
            return False
        other_block = other.blocks[block_label]
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```
This corrected version ensures that the `equals` function compares the blocks based on labels and locations, allowing it to accurately determine if the contents of both `self` and `other` are equal.

By implementing this correction, the `equals` function will accurately determine the equality of the blocks, and the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` will pass, thus resolving the GitHub issue.
