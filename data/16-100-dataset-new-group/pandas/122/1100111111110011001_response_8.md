To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the incorrect comparison of DataFrames. The bug causes the function to return `True` when it should return `False`. This bug is related to the incorrect comparison of the data within the DataFrames.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, the comparison of blocks is done based on their values and location within the block manager. This should ensure that the DataFrames are compared accurately and return the correct result.

By replacing the `dtype` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` comparison with the values of the blocks and their locations, the corrected function should pass the failing test and return the expected results.
