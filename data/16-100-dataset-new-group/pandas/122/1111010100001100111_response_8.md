### Error Location:
The potential error lies in the `equals` function where the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is performed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The issue arises when comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The comparison doesn't take into account the actual values and compares based on dtype name and manager locations, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks, not just the dtype name and manager locations. 

We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the values of the block along with the dtype name and manager locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)  # Include block values as well

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block values in the comparison, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
