The bug in the equals function of the BlockManager class results in failing the test_dataframe_not_equal test. The error message shows that the assert df1.equals(df2) is False, but the actual assertion returns True. This means that the function does not correctly identify when two DataFrame's are not equal. The bug is likely caused by the comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks.

A potential error location in the buggy function is the comparison of blocks in the self and other BlockManager instances. The current comparison does not take into account the content of the blocks, which leads to incorrect results.

The bug is caused by the faulty comparison of blocks in the self and other BlockManager instances. When comparing the blocks, the code only checks for the equality of block objects, rather than the content of the blocks themselves.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks, not just the block objects. We can achieve this by accessing the data within the blocks and comparing the content directly.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the content of blocks directly
    self_block_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_block, other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_block_data, other_block_data)
    )
```

By directly comparing the content of the blocks using numpy's array_equal function, we ensure that the comparison is based on the actual data within the blocks, rather than just comparing block objects. This should resolve the bug and make the equals function correctly identify when two BlockManager instances are not equal.
