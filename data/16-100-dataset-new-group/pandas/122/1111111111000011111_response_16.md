The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This bug is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return `False` when it is expected to return `True`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` which may not be correct.
2. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` which may not be correct.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of two DataFrame objects. This is leading to incorrect comparison results and the failing of the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is performed accurately within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version accurately compares the axes and blocks of two DataFrame objects. It should resolve the issue and make the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test pass as expected.
