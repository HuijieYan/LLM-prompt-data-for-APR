The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is not returning the expected output for the provided test case. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of blocks between two DataFrames and the sorting based on block properties.

Upon inspection of the buggy function:
1. The function compares the `self_axes` and `other_axes` of the two DataFrames and checks if the axes are equal in length and content.
2. It then consolidates the data using the `_consolidate_inplace` method for both DataFrames.
3. After consolidation, it compares the blocks of the two DataFrames using custom sorting (`canonicalize` function) based on block properties and then checks if the blocks are equal.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the comparison is correctly performed for the individual blocks. Additionally, the sorting based on block properties should be revised to accurately determine block equality between the two DataFrames.

Now, a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    # Step 1: Check if the axes are equal in length and content
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Ensure inplace consolidation of data for both DataFrames
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Step 3: Compare the blocks of the two DataFrames
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs))
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

The corrected function adds explicit checks for the equality of axes and adjusts the sorting of blocks based on block properties to ensure that the comparison accounts for block equality between the two DataFrames.
