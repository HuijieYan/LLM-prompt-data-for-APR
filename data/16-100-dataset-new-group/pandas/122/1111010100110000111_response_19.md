### Analysis
The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of the class for equality. The error message and the GitHub issue suggest that the comparison is returning `True` when it should actually return `False`, indicating a bug in the `equals` function.

### Error Locations
1. The comparison logic within the `equals` function seems to be flawed.
2. The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks based on their type and locations might be causing the comparison to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be occurring due to the flawed comparison logic and the sorting of blocks based on their type and locations. This leads to incorrect results, causing the `equals` function to return `True` instead of the expected `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Enhance the comparison logic within the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks based on their type and locations.
2. Reevaluate the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it accurately sorts the blocks according to their specified criteria.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block type and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the comparison logic has been enhanced, and the `canonicalize` function has been adjusted to accurately sort the blocks. This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that `equals` function returns the expected output.
