The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to check if two BlockManager instances are equal. However, it appears that the function is not working as expected, as evidenced by the failing test which checks if two DataFrames are not equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Using the `_consolidate_inplace` method in both `self` and `other` BlockManager instances without ensuring that these methods are working correctly.
2. Sorting the blocks of `self` and `other` using the `canonicalize` function, which seems to be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect functioning of the `_consolidate_inplace` and `canonicalize` methods which are called within the `equals` function. This leads to the incorrect comparison of `self` and `other` BlockManager instances.

To fix the bug, the `_consolidate_inplace` and `canonicalize` methods should be thoroughly tested and corrected if necessary. Additionally, the comparison logic within the `equals` function should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly checks for equality between the two BlockManager instances.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the unnecessary sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` has been removed, and the direct comparison of blocks has been introduced to check for equality. This ensures a more straightforward comparison between the two BlockManager instances.
