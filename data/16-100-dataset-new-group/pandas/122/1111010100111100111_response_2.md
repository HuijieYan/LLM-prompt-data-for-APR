The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail. The issue on GitHub titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" describes the problem and expectations in detail.

Upon analyzing the code and the test case, it appears that the `equals` method fails to properly compare the contents of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager's locations which can cause identical blocks with different locations to be considered equal when they are not.

To fix this bug, the sorting method needs to be changed to consider the locations of the blocks only if the blocks are of the same type. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to consider only type name for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should now compare the blocks correctly and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
