1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class and is responsible for checking whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal. The function uses the `_consolidate_inplace` function to consolidate the internal data structures before comparing the blocks for equality.

2. The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
   - Implementing the comparison logic to ensure it correctly identifies the equality of the `BlockManager` instances.
   - The usage of the `canonicalize` function and its impact on the sorting of the blocks.

3. The cause of the bug:
   When comparing two `DataFrame` instances using the `equals` function, the internal data blocks are not being correctly sorted and compared, leading to incorrect equality results. This is evidenced by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, which expects two distinct `DataFrame` instances to be identified as unequal but instead receives an incorrect result.

4. To fix the bug:
   - Correct the logic within the `equals` function to ensure the internal data blocks are correctly sorted and compared.
   - Possibly modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it accurately represents the data blocks for proper comparison.

5. Corrected version of the `equals` function:
   ```python
   def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize_block(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # Modified to include function invocation
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
   ```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the sorting of the data blocks and including appropriate function invocations, the corrected version aims to address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
