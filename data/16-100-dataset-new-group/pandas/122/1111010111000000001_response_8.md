## Analysis
The `equals` function is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library. It is used to determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method, which should return `False`. However, the function currently has a bug that causes it to return `True` incorrectly.

## Bug
The bug in the `equals` function occurs when comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. It fails to properly compare the blocks and determine if they are equal, causing the function to return `True` erroneously.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to correctly compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. This can be done by properly iterating over the blocks and comparing them using the `equals` method of the `Block` class.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the blocks using the equals method of the Block class
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True  # Return True if all blocks are equal
```

By iterating over the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances and comparing them using the `equals` method of the `Block` class, the corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that the comparison is done correctly, fixing the bug.
