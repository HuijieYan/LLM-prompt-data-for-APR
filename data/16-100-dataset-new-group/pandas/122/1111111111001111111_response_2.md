The bug in the `equals()` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to wrongly return `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize()` function within the `equals()` method is not properly sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This leads to incorrect comparison and hence the wrong output.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize()` function needs to be modified to properly sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. Additionally, the comparison logic in the `equals()` method needs to be updated to ensure that the correct comparison is performed.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals()` function should now return the correct result and pass the failing test case. This will also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
