The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.

The buggy function attempts to compare two dataframes for equality. However, the function fails to return the expected result and outputs `True` incorrectly for non-equal dataframes.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be removed from the `equals` method, and instead, all comparisons should be done directly using the `equals` method without relying on block canonicalization.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

The behavior of the corrected `equals` method will now correctly compare the dataframes and return `False` for the provided failing test. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This fix removes the unnecessary sorting and canonicalization of blocks, which was causing the incorrect comparison of dataframes. With this corrected version, the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class should now produce the expected results.
