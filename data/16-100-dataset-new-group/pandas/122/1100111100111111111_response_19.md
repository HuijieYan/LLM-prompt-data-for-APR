To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects. Based on the error message and the failing test, the issue seems to be with the comparison of the blocks. It appears that the blocks are being compared incorrectly, leading to the erroneous result `True is False`.

The corrected version of the `equals` function should include the following key points:
- Ensure that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` is performed correctly.
- Fix any discrepancies in the comparison of block locations or data types.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other functions...
    
    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Here, we fix the canonicalization function to properly compare blocks
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        # Ensure consistent order of blocks for comparison
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # Compare each block with its counterpart in the other BlockManager
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With the corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects and return the expected result. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post and should resolve the failing test.
