## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.to_tuple())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The bug was caused by the `canonicalize` function not properly converting `block.dtype` to a string and `block.mgr_locs` to a tuple, resulting in incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks. The corrected version of the function addresses this issue by converting `block.dtype` to a string using `str()` and `block.mgr_locs` to a tuple using `to_tuple()`.

This should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function returns the expected output when tested with the provided failing test case.
