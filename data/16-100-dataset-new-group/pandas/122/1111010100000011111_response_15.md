Based on the GitHub issue and the expected input/output values, the bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks. The issue occurs when identical blocks have different locations, causing the function to wrongly return `True` instead of `False`. 

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be updated to consider the locations of blocks when checking for equality. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to include the bytes representation of the `mgr_locs` to differentiate identical blocks with different locations. This ensures that block comparisons take block locations into account.
