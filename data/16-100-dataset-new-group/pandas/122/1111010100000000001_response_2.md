The buggy function `equals` is defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas.core.internals` module. The purpose of this function is to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function include:
1. Usage of `len(self_axes)` and `len(other_axes)` without first checking if `self_axes` and `other_axes` are not `None`.
2. Usage of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without first checking if `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are not `None`.

The cause of the bug may stem from the function not handling the case where `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `self.blocks`, or `other.blocks` are `None`, leading to potential attribute errors and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can add checks to ensure that `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `self.blocks`, and `other.blocks` are not `None` before performing operations on them.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if self_axes is None or other_axes is None:
        return False
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks, other_blocks = self.blocks, other.blocks
    if self_blocks is None or other_blocks is None:
        return False
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added checks to ensure that `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `self.blocks`, and `other.blocks` are not `None` before performing further operations. This should help prevent potential attribute errors and unexpected behavior.
