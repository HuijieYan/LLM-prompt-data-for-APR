The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of two `BlockManager` objects. It appears that the comparison is not treating identical blocks with different locations as different, leading to an incorrect `True` return value instead of the expected `False`.

The issue stems from sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a canonicalization function that combines the block type name and manager locations. It seems that this sorting is not taking into account the case where identical blocks have different locations, leading to the incorrect comparison result.

To fix this bug, a strategy can be to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the equality of block content as well as their positions. This can be achieved by adding a unique identifier for each block based on both the type name and the block content. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal during the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a unique identifier for each block based on type name and content
    def block_identifier(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_identifier)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_identifier)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.
