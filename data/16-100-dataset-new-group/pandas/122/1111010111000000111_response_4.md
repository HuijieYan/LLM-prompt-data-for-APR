Using the provided information, let's analyze the buggy function and identify potential error locations:

1. Buggy class: BlockManager
2. Buggy function: equals(self, other)
3. Failing test: test_dataframe_not_equal()

The cause of the bug is related to the equals() function of the BlockManager class. The issue mentioned on GitHub describes the problem as DataFrame.equals() wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The failing test also shows that when calling df3.equals(df4), it is expected to return False, but it doesn't.

The issue likely arises due to the sorting mechanism used in the equals() function, as well as the comparison of blocks.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to review the sorting and comparison mechanisms when comparing blocks.
2. We should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified and return False when comparing DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The updated version includes a corrected canonicalize() function to sort and compare blocks based on dtype and locations. This change should address the issue described in the GitHub report and have the test_dataframe_not_equal() test case pass successfully.
