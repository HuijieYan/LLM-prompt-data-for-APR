The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` for identical blocks with different locations. This issue is reflected in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The bug is related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. When comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, the function is not considering the identical blocks with different locations. As a result, the function returns `True` when it should be returning `False`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's locations (mgr_locs) when sorting the blocks. By considering the block's type name and locations, we can properly compare the blocks and prevent false equality.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes `block.mgr_locs` in the tuple. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are properly distinguished during the sorting process. Therefore, the `equals` function will now return the correct result for the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
