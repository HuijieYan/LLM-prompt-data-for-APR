The bug in the equals function is that it is returning True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This results in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()`. The issue reported on GitHub confirms the problem and provides a sample code that fails.

To fix the bug, we should update the equals function so that it correctly handles the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a function to compare blocks
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    # Compare sorted blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(compare_blocks(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the equals function will now correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
