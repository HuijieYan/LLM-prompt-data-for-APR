The bug in the function seems to be related to the comparison of self_axes and other_axes, as well as the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks. It also seems that the canonicalize function is defined twice, once in the class and once on its own.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of self_axes and other_axes does not handle the case where the axes are in different orders, resulting in the comparison failing. Additionally, the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks based on the canonicalize function may not be consistent due to the duplicate definition of the canonicalize function.

To fix the bug, I would suggest modifying the comparison of self_axes and other_axes to account for different orders and ensuring that the canonicalize function is defined only once and accessible to both the class and the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = sorted(self.axes), sorted(other.axes)  # sorting the axes to account for different orders
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This version sorts the self_axes and other_axes before comparing them, ensuring that their order does not affect the comparison. Additionally, it defines the canonicalize function within the function, avoiding the duplicate definition issue.
