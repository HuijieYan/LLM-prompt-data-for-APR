The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to the comparison of BlockManager objects in the `equals` function. The failing test is meant to check if two DataFrames are not equal, but the function currently returns True when it should return False. This indicates that the comparison logic in the `equals` function is incorrect.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it's clear that the issue lies in the comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks. The comparison logic currently fails to consider the possibility of identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the content of the blocks rather than just their order or locations. This can be achieved by comparing the actual values within the blocks and ensuring that they match between the two BlockManager objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare the blocks based on content
    sorted_self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: b.values)
    sorted_other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: b.values)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(sorted_self_blocks, sorted_other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` function now sorts the blocks based on their values before comparing them, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations will still be considered equal. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
