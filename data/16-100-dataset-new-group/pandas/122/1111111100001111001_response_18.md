The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. It is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.

Upon analysis of the given runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values, it can be understood that the bug lies in the way the comparison of block locations is being handled. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, but it is implemented incorrectly.

The bug causes the `equals` method to incorrectly determine the equality of the two `BlockManager` instances, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix this bug, the implementation of the `canonicalize` function should be modified to properly sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks
    # which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is modified to use the `str` representation of the block's dtype and manager locations. This ensures that the blocks are properly sorted based on their type name and manager locations, leading to correct comparison results.
