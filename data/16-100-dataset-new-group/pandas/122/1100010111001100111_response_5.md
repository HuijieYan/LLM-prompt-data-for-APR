The buggy function `equals` is responsible for comparing the equality of two BlockManager objects. The function first compares the axes of the objects and then proceeds to compare the blocks. The issue reported in GitHub indicates that the function erroneously returns True when identical blocks have different locations.

The potential location of the error in the buggy function lies in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The sorting logic might not be correctly identifying whether two blocks are identical if they have different locations.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect behavior of the `canonicalize` function, which is used for sorting the blocks. This could lead to different blocks with different locations being considered as equal, resulting in the function incorrectly returning True.

To fix the bug, the sorting logic based on the `canonicalize` function needs to be adjusted to ensure that blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal. This can be achieved by refining the `canonicalize` function to consider the block locations and update the sorting process accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses both the type name and block locations to generate a tuple for comparison. This ensures that blocks with different locations are accurately distinguished, addressing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
