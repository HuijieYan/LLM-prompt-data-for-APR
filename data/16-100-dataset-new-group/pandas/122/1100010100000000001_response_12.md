# The buggy function attempts to compare two objects for equality.

## Potential Errors:
1. The function uses `self` and `other` without checking if they are valid objects.
2. The function does not handle cases where `self_axes` and `other_axes` are empty lists, which can cause potential errors when attempting to access their elements.
3. The function sorts `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, but it does not handle cases where `self.blocks` or `other.blocks` are empty lists, which can lead to errors during sorting or comparison.

## Bugs Cause:
1. The buggy function does not handle edge cases where the input lists are empty, which can lead to index out of range errors or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Add input validation to check if `self` and `other` are valid objects before accessing their attributes.
2. Add checks for empty lists `self_axes` and `other_axes` to prevent errors when accessing their elements.
3. Add checks for empty lists `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to handle sorting and comparison without errors.

def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        return False

    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if not self_axes or not other_axes:
        return False
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if not self.blocks or not other.blocks:
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
