The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two objects for equality and is expecting two Pandas DataFrame objects `self` and `other`. The function then proceeds to perform various checks and comparisons between the two DataFrames to determine if they are equal.

The failing test is indicating that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, and the error message indicates that the comparison of `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method is resulting in `True` instead of `False`.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The comparison logic that follows the consolidation of the blocks.
2. The `canonicalize` function that is used to sort the blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic within the `equals` function may not be correctly identifying the differences between the two DataFrames. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function may not be accurately sorting and comparing the blocks within the DataFrames.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the comparison logic within the `equals` function and the `canonicalize` function are correctly implemented to accurately identify and compare the elements within the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if any(not block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the logic for checking the axes and consolidating the DataFrames remains the same, but the comparison logic has been simplified to directly check if any of the blocks are not equal, returning `False` in that case. This simplification avoids the need for sorting the blocks and using the `canonicalize` function, which could have been a source of the bug.
