The bug in the `equals` function lies in the way it compares `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function attempts to canonicalize these blocks, sort them, and then compare them. However, it seems to be comparing the blocks incorrectly, resulting in a failed test. 

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the way the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are compared. Instead of sorting and comparing the blocks directly, we can compare the blocks first and then sort them based on the comparison result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare and sort blocks based on the comparison result
    sorted_self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name))
    sorted_other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(sorted_self_blocks, sorted_other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test.
