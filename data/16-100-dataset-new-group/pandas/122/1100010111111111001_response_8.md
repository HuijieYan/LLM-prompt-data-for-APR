The buggy function `equals` is not properly comparing the two DataFrame objects `self` and `other`. The function compares the axes and the blocks of the two DataFrames, but the comparison logic is flawed, leading to a wrong result.

Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The comparison logic for the axes and blocks of the two DataFrames is incorrect.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly when it should return `False`, leading to the failing test.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The code for comparing the axes and blocks of the two DataFrames needs to be revised to ensure that the function `equals` returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the axes of the two DataFrames
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    
    # Compare the blocks of the two DataFrames
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly compare the two DataFrames and return the expected result.
