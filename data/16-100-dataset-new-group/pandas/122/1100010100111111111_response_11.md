The buggy function `equals` seems to be incorrectly comparing two `BlockManager` objects (self and other) for equality. 

The failing test is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it's returning `True`, leading to the AssertionError. This suggests that the `equals` method is not correctly identifying the difference between the two dataframes.

The bug is caused by an incorrect comparison implementation in the `equals` function. The comparisons of the block types and their locations are not being handled correctly, leading to an incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, we need to review the comparison logic and ensure that it correctly identifies differences between the `self` and `other` block managers.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By sorting the blocks based on their types and locations, we ensure that the comparison is done in a consistent order, thereby correctly identifying the difference between the `self` and `other` block managers.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test, returning the expected outputs.
