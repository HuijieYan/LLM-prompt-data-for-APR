The bug in the `equals` function appears to be related to the way it is comparing the `self_axes` and `other_axes`. It also seems to have issues with comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. It is not properly handling the comparison of block objects, which results in incorrect equality checks.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the comparison logic to handle the comparison of axes and blocks more effectively. We can also ensure that the comparison of block objects is done correctly by considering the different attributes of the block objects.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected function, we first compare the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`. If they are not equal, we return `False`. Then, we iterate through the blocks of `self` and `other`, comparing each pair of blocks using the `equals` method of the block objects. If any pair of blocks is not equal, we return `False`. Otherwise, we return `True` to indicate that all comparisons were successful.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values provided for the failing test cases.
