## Bug Explanation

The bug appears to be related to the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The function is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks, but it is returning incorrect results for certain input cases where the block locations are different but the blocks themselves are identical. This behavior is not as expected, as evident from the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug seems to be in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function is sorting the blocks based on a canonicalization function that uses the block's data type name and location (`mgr_locs`), but it's not taking into account the actual values of the block. This can lead to incorrect results where blocks are identical but have different locations.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should consider the actual values in the blocks, not just their data type and locations. This can be achieved by comparing the blocks directly, rather than sorting and comparing them based on canonicalization. Additionally, if the problem is due to the comparison of block locations, the comparison logic should be updated to consider this as well.

## Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```
