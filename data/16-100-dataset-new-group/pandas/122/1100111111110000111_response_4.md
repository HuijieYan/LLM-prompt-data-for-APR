The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` for two different DataFrames as shown in the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`. This issue has been reported on GitHub with the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The proposed fix should address the incorrect comparison made by the `equals` function.

The root cause of the bug comes from the way the `equals` function compares the DataFrame blocks. When comparing blocks, the canonicalize function is used to sort the blocks, which might result in two different DataFrames having the same blocks arranged differently being considered equal. Additionally, there are multiple definitions of the `canonicalize` function within the class.


To fix the bug:
- Remove the extra `canonicalize` function from the `BlockManager` class.
- Modify the canonicalize function in the `equals` function to ensure that it considers the order and structure of columns in the DataFrame.
- Update the logic of comparing blocks in the `equals` function to accurately differentiate between DataFrames with different block arrangements.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_sorted_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_sorted_blocks()
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Additionally, a new method `get_sorted_blocks` should be added to the `BlockManager` class to handle the sorting of blocks based on the columns and their order.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should resolve the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes as expected.
