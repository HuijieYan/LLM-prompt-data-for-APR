The potential error in the buggy function lies in the `canonicalize` function. This function is sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, the input values for `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs` are not being updated and are not consistent with the actual block values. This can cause the sorting to be inaccurate and lead to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to retrieve the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` values from the correct blocks before sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `lambda x: canonicalize(x)` as the key function in the `sorted` call, we are ensuring that the `canonicalize` function is called for each block before sorting, ensuring the correct sorting order based on the actual block data.
