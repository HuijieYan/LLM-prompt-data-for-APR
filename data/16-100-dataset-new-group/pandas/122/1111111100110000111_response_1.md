Based on the analysis of the buggy function, related class, corresponding error message, and the GitHub issue, here is a breakdown of the issue and a strategy for fixing it:

1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise. The error message indicates that the test case fails when calling `df1.equals(df2)` with two different dataframes. The GitHub issue also confirms that the expected behavior should be to return `False` in this case.

2. The potential error locations within the `equals` function are the comparisons of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` as well as the sorting and comparison of the respective blocks.

3. The cause of the bug is that the comparison method in the `equals` function is not correctly handling cases where the dataframes have identical blocks with different locations. This leads to an unexpected `True` return when comparing two different dataframes.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to appropriately handle cases where the blocks have the same data but different locations in the dataframe.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider only the block values, and then sorting and comparing the blocks based on their values, we can ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected, producing the correct result for the failing test case.
