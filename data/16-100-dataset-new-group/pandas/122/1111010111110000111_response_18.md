## Potential Error Locations

The potential error locations within the function "equals" are:
1. Incorrect comparison of dataframes.
2. Issues with sorting and canonicalizing the blocks.
3. Incorrect implementation of "block.equals" comparison.

## Cause of the Bug

The bug causes the function "equals" to incorrectly return True even if the dataframes have identical blocks with different locations. This is a result of an incorrect implementation of the comparison logic within the function. The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" provides a specific example that triggers this bug.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is evaluating to `assert True is False`, which means that the `equals` method is returning True when it should return False. The GitHub issue further corroborates this, where the user expected the result to be False, but it incorrectly returned True.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the "equals" function needs to be revised. Specifically, the comparison of blocks, sorting, and canonicalization of blocks should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the function accurately determines whether two dataframes are equal. Additionally, the implementation of the "block.equals" comparison should be thoroughly checked to ensure it correctly compares the blocks.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Convert blocks to a comparable format 
    def get_comparable_blocks(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_comparable_blocks = [get_comparable_blocks(block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_comparable_blocks = [get_comparable_blocks(block) for block in other.blocks]
    
    # Sort the comparable blocks
    self_comparable_blocks.sort()
    other_comparable_blocks.sort()
    
    # Compare the sorted comparable blocks
    return self_comparable_blocks == other_comparable_blocks
```

In the corrected version of the "equals" function, the comparison logic has been revised to ensure that it correctly compares the blocks in a sortable and comparable format. This should resolve the issue and cause the failing test to pass.
