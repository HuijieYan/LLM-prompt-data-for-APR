The buggy function `equals` is from the pandas library and is intended to compare two objects for equality. The function is failing to return the expected result when comparing two dataframes in the given test case.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `canonicalize` function may not be sorting the blocks correctly, leading to incorrect comparison results.
2. The comparison of individual blocks using the `equals` method may not be working as intended.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not handling the comparison of dataframes correctly, resulting in a false negative when comparing the two dataframes in the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks being compared are sorted and then compared correctly. We can achieve this by modifying the sorting logic and comparison logic within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # compare if the sorted blocks are equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case provided.
