The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function uses `block.dtype.name`, which is not a reliable identifier for the block type, and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which may not be unique for different blocks. This can lead to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to use a more reliable identifier for the block type and include more unique data from the block itself for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Use block's type and unique identifier for comparison
        identifier = id(block)
        return (type(block), identifier)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the comparison of blocks will be more reliable and unique, ensuring that the `equals` function will produce the correct result.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
