The buggy function `equals` has an issue with comparing two DataFrames. The problem lies in the comparison logic of the blocks within the `BlockManager` class. When comparing DataFrames, if the length of the axes does not match or if any of the blocks do not match, the function should return `False`. 

The issue is likely occurring because the function is not able to correctly compare the blocks due to unconsolidated blocks, such as Categorical blocks. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic for the blocks is robust enough to handle different block types and can accurately compare them without relying solely on block order.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # comparison of blocks
        for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
            if not block1.equals(block2):
                return False
                
        return True
```

With this corrected version, the function should now accurately compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` class, ensuring that the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test case passes.
