The buggy function `equals` compares the internal data structures of two DataFrames to check if they are equal. However, the function does not handle cases where identical blocks have different locations correctly.

The bug is causing the `equals` function to return True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, which is unexpected. This bug prevents users from accurately comparing DataFrames based on their internal data structure.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `equals` function to account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. One approach to solving this issue is to sort the blocks using a canonicalization function that ensures blocks with the same content but different locations are compared correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._get_value(0, 0), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function evaluates each block based on its content and location, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are compared correctly. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and prevent the `equals` function from returning True for DataFrames with different block locations.
