The buggy function "equals" is used to compare two instances of the BlockManager class. The function fails to properly compare the two instances due to a sorting issue with the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" lists. The sorting is intended to order the blocks based on their data type and location, but the current implementation is causing incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their data type and location, allowing for accurate comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.max())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the axes of the two instances are equal, and then proceed with consolidating the data before comparing the blocks. The "canonicalize" function is used to generate a key for sorting the blocks based on their data type and location, and then the sorted blocks are used for comparison.

This should resolve the issue of incorrect comparisons caused by the sorting problem in the original function.
