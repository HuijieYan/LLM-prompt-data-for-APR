The bug in the provided code is within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The bug causes the `equals` function to return incorrect results when comparing two BlockManagers, resulting in unexpected behavior. 

The function compares the axes of the two BlockManagers, then consolidates them in place before comparing the number of blocks and their content. However, the bug lies in the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This sorting is causing the unexpected behavior when comparing two BlockManagers with identical blocks but different locations. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the order of the blocks as well, as the order affects the equality check.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        # consolidate the BlockManagers
        self_consolidated = self.copy()
        self_consolidated._consolidate_inplace()
        other_consolidated = other.copy()
        other_consolidated._consolidate_inplace()

        self_blocks = self_consolidated.blocks
        other_blocks = other_consolidated.blocks

        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        # consider block order when comparing
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            # directly comparing block1 and block2 for equality
            if not block1.equals(block2):
                return False

        return True
```

In this corrected version, the function first consolidates both BlockManagers using the `_consolidate_inplace` method, and then compares the number of blocks and their content. It now considers the order of the blocks when comparing them for equality, thus effectively addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
