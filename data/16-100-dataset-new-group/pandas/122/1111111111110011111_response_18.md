To fix the issue with the `equals` function, we need to address the comparison of dataframes that have identical blocks but different locations. This is causing the function to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False`.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of axes between the two dataframes is accurate.
2. Change the comparison of blocks to consider both the data type name and location (mgr_locs).
3. Sort the blocks based on the tuple combination of data type name and mgr_locs to overcome unconsolidated blocks.

With this strategy in mind, here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # existing code...

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function should address the bug and enable it to pass the failing test while also satisfying the expected input/output values.
