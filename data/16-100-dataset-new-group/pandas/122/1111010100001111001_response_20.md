The issue in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class lies in the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists. The method is not comparing the blocks properly, resulting in incorrect equality checks.

To fix this bug, we need to re-implement the comparison of the blocks in the `equals` method. We can do this by iterating through the blocks in both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, and comparing each block specifically. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
# Corrected equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through each block in `self.blocks` and compare it with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. If any comparison fails, we immediately return `False`.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result for comparing `BlockManager` instances.
