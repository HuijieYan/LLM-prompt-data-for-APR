The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison and ordering of the blocks in the `BlockManager`. The issue on GitHub confirms that the `equals` function wrongly returns true in cases where there are identical blocks with different locations. This is consistent with the code and the provided runtime values, where the `canonicalize` function is used to order the blocks based on their data type and locations.

The bug is likely caused by the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which might not effectively distinguish between blocks with the same data type but different locations. As a result, the equality comparison between the sorted blocks (`self_blocks` and `other_blocks`) does not correctly identify cases where the blocks have the same content but different locations.

To fix the bug, the sorting logic of the blocks should be updated to take into account the actual content of the blocks rather than just their data type and location. One possible strategy for fixing the bug would be to change the `canonicalize` function to generate a unique signature for each block based on its content, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are ordered together.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._get_values()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function uses the `_get_values` method of the blocks to generate a unique signature based on their content rather than their data type and location. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly ordered and compared for equality.
