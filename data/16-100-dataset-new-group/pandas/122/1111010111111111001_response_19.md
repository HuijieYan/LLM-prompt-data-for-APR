Based on the error message, failing test, and runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the `equals()` function is failing due to sorting the blocks using inconsistent or incorrect criteria, resulting in the sorted blocks not being equal to each other when compared.

To fix this bug:
1. We should ensure that the sorting criteria and method for comparing the blocks is consistent and correct.
2. The sorting function should be carefully reviewed to avoid inconsistencies with data types and indices.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values[0].dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version, the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass without any assertion errors.
