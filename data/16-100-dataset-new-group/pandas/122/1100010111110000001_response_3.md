The issue in the code is that the `canonicalize` function is not correctly comparing the dataframes. The `canonicalize` function is sorting blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but in the case of dataframes with differing values, it is not an accurate way to compare them.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the dataframe comparison correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Instead of sorting, just compare the block values
        return block.values

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `canonicalize` function now simply returns the block values, and the comparison is done based on the block values themselves rather than the data type names and locations.

This corrected version of the code should now pass the failing test.
