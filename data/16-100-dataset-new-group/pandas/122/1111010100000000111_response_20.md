The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects and checks if they are equal. However, the function fails to properly handle the case where the two objects have identical blocks but with different locations.

The issue on GitHub describes a scenario where the `DataFrame.equals` function should return False, but it erroneously returns True instead.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class so that it accurately compares the block contents and considers the block locations as well.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the `canonicalize` function to include the block's `mgr_locs` as a tuple. Additionally, when comparing blocks, we also compare their `mgr_locs` to ensure we account for identical blocks with different locations.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and accurately compare `BlockManager` objects, taking into consideration identical blocks with different locations.
