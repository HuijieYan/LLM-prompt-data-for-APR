The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The `sorted` function is being used to sort the blocks based on a canonicalization function, but the sorting method appears to be causing the wrong comparison results. Based on the GitHub issue, the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the given inputs.

The bug seems to be in the `canonicalize` function. The `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` is used to create the key for sorting, but it might not be generating unique keys for blocks with the same content but different locations.

To fix this bug, we should generate a unique key for each block that accurately represents its content. We can use the block values themselves as the key, as this will differentiate between blocks with the same content but different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the sorting and canonicalization step, we avoid the issue of wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
