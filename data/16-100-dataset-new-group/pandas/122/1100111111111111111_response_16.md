The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. The function incorrectly returns True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, leading to an AssertionError.

The bug is likely located in the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their types and manager locations. This sorting is causing the comparison to return True even when the blocks have different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to use the type and content of the blocks rather than their locations to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.get_values().tolist(), type(block)))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.get_values().tolist(), type(block)))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we're sorting the blocks based on their values and types instead of their locations. This should resolve the issue and cause the failing test to pass.
