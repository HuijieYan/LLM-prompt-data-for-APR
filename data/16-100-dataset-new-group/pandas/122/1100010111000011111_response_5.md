The bug in the `equals` method is causing it to return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This can be seen in the failing test case where `df1.equals(df2)` incorrectly returns `True`. The cause of this bug is likely related to the ordering and comparison of blocks in the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified. This will ensure that the block order is consistent in both DataFrames for comparison. Additionally, the comparison of blocks should be updated to compare their order as well.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method will sort the blocks based on the combination of `mgr_locs`, `dtype` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This will ensure that the block order is consistent and that identical blocks with different locations are correctly handled.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub with the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
