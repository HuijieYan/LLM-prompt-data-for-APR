The bug in the function "equals" is likely caused by the use of a variable "block" within the function that is not defined in the scope of the function. It seems like "block" is supposed to refer to a block object within the "self.blocks" tuple, but it is not explicitly being looped through. The function is also calling the "canonicalize" function but not providing the "block" variable to it as an argument.

To fix the bug, the function should iterate through "self.blocks" and "other.blocks" and compare each block to its corresponding block in the other BlockManager. Additionally, the "canonicalize" function should take the "block" variable as an argument.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this correction, the function iterates through each block in "self.blocks" and "other.blocks" and compares them. It also provides the "block" variable to the "canonicalize" function, ensuring that it operates as intended.
