The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames `self` and `other` by first checking if they have the same number of axes, then consolidating them in place, and then comparing the blocks within the DataFrames. The error message indicates that the comparison is not working as intended, and the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2)` is failing.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. The consolidation of `self` and `other` in place may not be handled correctly causing unexpected behavior.
2. The sorting and comparison of blocks might not be functioning as expected.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the inconsistency in handling and comparing the blocks within the DataFrames. This inconsistency could be related to the consolidation process or the sorting/comparison of blocks.

To fix the bug, the consolidation process needs to be revisited to ensure that it is correctly handling the DataFrames `self` and `other`. Additionally, the sorting and comparison of blocks should be reviewed to ensure it is producing the expected results.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version ensures correct consolidation in place and revisits the sorting and comparison of blocks to ensure that the DataFrames `self` and `other` are compared appropriately.
