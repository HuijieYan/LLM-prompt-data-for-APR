## Correction:

The issue is caused because the `equals` function is not correctly identifying cases where identical blocks have different locations. The `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on their type name and locations does not take into account the case where two completely different dataframes result in the same sorted order when calling `canonicalize`. This leads to false positives where the `equals` function wrongly returns `True`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional identifiers for the blocks, such as their values. By including the values of the blocks in the sorting criteria, we can ensure that truly distinct dataframes will not be mistakenly identified as equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now correctly identify cases where identical blocks have different locations, and the failing test should pass. This fix addresses the GitHub issue where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations.
