The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test. The issue is that the function incorrectly determines the equality of two `BlockManager` instances based on their blocks and axes.

The bug arises because the function does not properly handle the case where two `BlockManager` instances have identical blocks in different locations. Additionally, the function does not compare the blocks in a way that is reflective of the actual equality comparison for the two `BlockManager` instances.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances based on their content rather than their locations.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_block_values = [b.values for b in self.blocks]
    other_block_values = [b.values for b in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_block, other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_block_values, other_block_values)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the function compares the block values of the two `BlockManager` instances rather than the block locations. This ensures that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the two instances.

By implementing this change, the function should now correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
