The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks, and it contains a few potential error locations.

The first issue is that the function invokes the `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` methods without being sure that these methods exist. The `if` statements should be used to validate that these methods are available and callable.

The second issue is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the class scope and once outside of it. Additionally, within `canonicalize` there is a call to `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which should likely be `block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()`.

The bug occurs because the method does not properly handle the possibility that `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are not in the same order, which is important when comparing them. Additionally, there is a bug in the `canonicalize` function.

To fix the bug, the code can be updated as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if hasattr(self, '_consolidate_inplace'):
        self._consolidate_inplace()
    if hasattr(other, '_consolidate_inplace'):
        other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `hasattr` function is used to check if the `_consolidate_inplace` method exists before calling it. The `canonicalize` function is also fixed to correctly call `block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()`. Lastly, the code ensures that `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted and compared correctly.
