The issue described is related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method returning `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations, instead of the expected `False`. This indicates a bug in the comparison logic, which is likely due to the comparison not taking into account the block locations.

The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks of the `self` and `other` instances. The comparison logic needs to consider the block locations to correctly determine equality.

Based on the provided runtime input/output variable values, it seems that the bug is occurring when comparing the blocks using the `equals` method, as the comparison is not accounting for the different block locations.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to account for the block locations in addition to the block values.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.values))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on both their locations and values before comparison to ensure that the comparison considers both aspects. This should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
