The buggy function seems to be comparing two BlockManager objects. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes of both BlockManager objects are equal. Then, it checks if all corresponding axes are equal using the `equals()` method. Next, the function consolidates the blocks within each BlockManager object and checks if the number of blocks is equal between the two. After that, the function sorts the blocks based on their data type and memory location and then compares each corresponding block using the `equals()` method.

The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False` when it should be `False`.

The potential error might be in the comparison of the blocks between the two BlockManager objects. It's possible that the sorting and comparison process is not correctly identifying the differences between the blocks.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison process of the blocks to ensure that it accurately identifies any differences.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if the blocks are equal
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through each block and compare them using the `equals()` method. If any blocks are found to be unequal, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` at the end.
