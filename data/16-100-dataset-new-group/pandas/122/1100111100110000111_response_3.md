The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing DataFrames and returning incorrect results. The failing test is returning `assert True is False`, which indicates that the comparison of the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method is resulting in `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the DataFrames and is not taking into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be modified to properly compare the blocks within the DataFrames, taking into account the block locations. This will ensure that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations will be correctly identified as not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Comparison function for sorting blocks
    def compare_blocks(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=compare_blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=compare_blocks)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By using a comparison function to sort the blocks based on both the values and the block locations, the corrected `equals` function will accurately compare the DataFrames and provide the correct output when using the `equals` method.

After implementing this fix, the failing test case should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
