The issue with the provided function seems to be related to the equals() method not correctly identifying when two DataFrames are not equal. The specific failing test indicates that the equals() method is returning True when it should be False due to the differences in the values of the DataFrames.

The potential error locations within the function are the comparison of self and other axes using `.equals()`, the comparison of self and other blocks, and the canonicalization of block order.

The cause of the bug is likely the comparison of self and other axes using `.equals()`, which may not correctly identify differences in the axis values of the DataFrames, leading to an incorrect result when checking for equality.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison of axes and blocks using the appropriate comparison method and ensure that it correctly identifies the differences between two DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self_cons = self._consolidate_inplace()
    other_cons = other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self_cons.blocks) != len(other_cons.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self_cons.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other_cons.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
        
    return True
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
