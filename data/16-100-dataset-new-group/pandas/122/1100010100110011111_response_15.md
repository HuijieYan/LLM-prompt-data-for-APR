The buggy function "equals" is compared two DataFrame objects and returning True even when the DataFrames are not equal. The error message from the failing test shows that the function is returning True instead of False when two DataFrames are not equal. The expected input and output variable values suggest that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the DataFrames.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the sorting of self.blocks and other.blocks using the "canonicalize" function. This sorting might not be correctly comparing the blocks for equality.

The bug is caused by the function incorrectly comparing the blocks of the DataFrames for equality, leading to the wrong return value. This is indicated by the failing test case and the GitHub issue where the user expected the function to return False, but it returned True instead.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function compares the blocks within the DataFrames for equality. This might involve a change in the sorting mechanism or a direct comparison of the blocks.

A corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # directly compare the blocks for equality
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we are directly comparing the blocks within the DataFrames for equality, ensuring that the function returns the correct value. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub and pass the failing test.
