The bug in the equals function is in the canonicalize function. The canonicalize function is defined both at the module level and within the BlockManager class. However, when the canonicalize function is called within the equals function, it does not use the correct scope to reference the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function within the equals function should be accessed using the class scope. The correct reference to the canonicalize function should be `BlockManager.canonicalize` instead of `canonicalize`. This will ensure that the correct function is being called within the equals function.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
        
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=BlockManager.canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=BlockManager.canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the equals function should now pass the failing test case.
