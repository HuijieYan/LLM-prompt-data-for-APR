The issue described on Github highlights a bug in the `equals` function for `DataFrame` objects. The problem occurs when this function returns True for cases where there are identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.

The root cause of the issue is that the `equals` function for `BlockManager` class is using the `canonicalize` function defined in the same class, which actually has the same name but a different signature in another place in the file. This ambiguity causes the sorting to be based on the wrong method. As a result, the function considers the blocks to be equal despite having different locations.

To fix this bug, we should remove the inner `canonicalize` function and utilize the correct version of the function already defined within the same class.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly return `False` for identical blocks with different locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
