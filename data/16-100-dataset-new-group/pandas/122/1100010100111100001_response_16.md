The bug in the provided function `equals` is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return an incorrect value.

The error message indicates that `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because `True` is being returned instead of `False`.

The bug is likely in the logic of comparing the blocks within the `equals` function. Specifically, the sorting of the blocks based on `canonicalize` and the subsequent comparison using `block.equals(oblock)` seems to be causing the issue.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly. This may involve revisiting the logic for sorting the blocks and comparing their contents.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
