The buggy function `equals` is located within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas/core/internals` directory. This class is responsible for managing a set of labeled, mixed-type 2D ndarrays that are used by the DataFrame public API class.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are the conditional statements that return `False` and the sorting of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists, as well as the comparison of the elements within the lists.

The cause of the bug is that when comparing the `self_axes` and `other_axes`, there is the potential for different lengths of axes to not be handled properly, resulting in a premature `False` return. Additionally, when sorting and comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, the ordering may not be consistent, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements need to be properly addressed to handle different lengths of axes in a better way, and when sorting and comparing the blocks, a more robust method for comparison and ordering should be used.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_cons = self.consolidate()
    other_cons = other.consolidate()

    if len(self_cons.blocks) != len(other_cons.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self_cons.blocks
    other_blocks = other_cons.blocks
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `consolidate` method is used to ensure that the blocks are properly consolidated before comparison. The `canonicalize` function now uses the block's values for ordering, ensuring a consistent comparison. The `self_cons` and `other_cons` are now used to sort and compare the blocks, ensuring that potential unconsolidated blocks are handled correctly.
