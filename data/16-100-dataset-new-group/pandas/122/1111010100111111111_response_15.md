The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class causes it to erroneously return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This leads to failing test cases and a GitHub issue.

The bug occurs because the `equals` method does not handle situations where the blocks have identical data but different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` method to compare the data in the blocks and not just their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Compare the blocks
    for block_key, block in self.blocks.items():
        if block_key in other_blocks:
            if not block.values.equals(other_blocks[block_key].values):
                return False
        else:
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we compare the data in the blocks using the `equals` method for the block values. This ensures that the method correctly identifies differences in block data even if the locations are different.

By making this change, the `equals` method should now accurately compare two DataFrames even when the blocks have different locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
