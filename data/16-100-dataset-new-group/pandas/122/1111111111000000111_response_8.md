### Bug Analysis:

#### Buggy Function:
The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. This function compares two block managers by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, sorting their blocks, and then checking if each block is equal to the corresponding block in the other block manager.

#### Related Functions:
The buggy function calls the `_consolidate_inplace` function, `equals` function, and `canonicalize` function within the same class. It also uses the `as_array` function from the same file, which is not part of the same class.

#### Test Code:
There is a failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` that checks if two dataframes with different values for the same columns are not equal. The test fails because the `equals` function returns True when it should return False.

#### GitHub Issue:
The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" describes the problem. It includes a code sample demonstrating the issue, the expected output, and the versions of Pandas and other libraries being used.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely in the logic for sorting and comparing the blocks in the `equals` function.

### Bug Cause:
The issue seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of blocks. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of blocks with identical values but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `equals` function to correctly handle blocks with identical values but different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version of the `equals` function, we sort the blocks based on their values and locations and then compare them for equality. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
