## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block._can_hold_identical_data(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
The original function has a bug related to sorting and comparing blocks. The DataFrame.equals() method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. To fix this bug, the canonicalize function should return a tuple with the type of the block and the block's management locations. Additionally, when comparing blocks, the method _can_hold_identical_data should be used instead.

The corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues and is expected to resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.
