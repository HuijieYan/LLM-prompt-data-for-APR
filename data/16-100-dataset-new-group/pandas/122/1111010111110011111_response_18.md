## Correction:

The buggy function `equals` improperly compares the two dataframes `self` and `other` by sorting their blocks and then checking if corresponding blocks are equal. This can lead to incorrect results due to different ordering or different locations of the same data.

To fix this bug, we should instead use the underlying data of the dataframes to directly compare their values. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_data = self.to_numpy()
    other_data = other.to_numpy()
    return np.array_equal(self_data, other_data)
```

With this correction, the function uses the `to_numpy()` method to retrieve the underlying data of the dataframes and then directly compares the two arrays using `np.array_equal`, which compares the values element-wise.

This correction will address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected in the failing test case.
