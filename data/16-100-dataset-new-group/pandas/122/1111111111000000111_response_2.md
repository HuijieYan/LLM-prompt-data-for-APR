## Analysis of the bug and potential error locations:
The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. The issue reported in the GitHub links to a failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file, which compares two DataFrames and expects them to be not equal.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison of DataFrames using the `equals` method. It incorrectly returns True when the DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class not properly comparing the blocks of two DataFrames. When the method is called to check equality of two DataFrames, it incorrectly compares the internal blocks without considering their locations. This results in the method returning True even when the DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to properly consider the locations of the blocks when comparing two DataFrames. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on their types and locations before comparison.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Create a canonicalize function to sort blocks based on type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tostring())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` method now includes a `canonicalize` function to properly sort the blocks based on their type and location. This allows for accurate comparison of the blocks, addressing the issue of identical blocks with different locations incorrectly returning True.
