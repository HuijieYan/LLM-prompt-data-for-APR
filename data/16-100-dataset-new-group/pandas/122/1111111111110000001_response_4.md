The buggy function `equals` is supposed to determine if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal, but it does not do so properly. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two dataframes are equal, but the test fails and throws an AssertionError.

The bug is likely located in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, where it attempts to check if different blocks are equal. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the logic in the `equals` function for comparing individual blocks within the `BlockManager`. It is failing to properly determine if the two instances are equal based on the checks made during block comparison.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to rewrite the logic within the `equals` function to properly compare the individual blocks for equality, thereby correctly determining whether the two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks()
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the individual blocks of the `BlockManager` are compared for equality, using the `equals` function of the block values. This should correctly determine whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal, and address the bug.
