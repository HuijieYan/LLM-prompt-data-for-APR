## Analysis of the buggy function
The buggy function is a method called 'equals' within a class. It compares two instances of the class and returns True if they are equal and False if they are not.

## Potential error locations
1. The method assumes that both instances have the same number of axes and blocks, leading to potential IndexErrors.
2. There is a sorting operation on the self.blocks and other.blocks, which may not work correctly if the block objects are not sortable.
3. The usage of 'block.equals(oblock)' assumes that both block and oblock have an 'equals' method, which may not always be the case.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by potential mismatch in the number of axes and blocks, unsortable blocks, and the assumption that all blocks have an 'equals' method.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check the length of axes and blocks in both instances and handle cases where they do not match.
2. Ensure that the blocks are sortable or provide custom sorting logic.
3. Check if the 'equals' method exists for each block and handle cases where it does not.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes) or len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not hasattr(block, 'equals') or not hasattr(oblock, 'equals'):
            return False
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the number of axes and blocks match. Then, it consolidates both instances before sorting the blocks using a custom sorting key. Finally, it iterates over the sorted blocks and checks if each block has the 'equals' method and if they are equal. If any condition fails, it returns False. If all conditions pass, it returns True.
