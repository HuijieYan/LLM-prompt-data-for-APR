The bug in the provided function is caused by a mismatch in the block order comparison when checking for the equality of two BlockManager objects. This is due to the sorting of the blocks based on their type name and mgr_locs, which may not guarantee the correct comparison of blocks across different BlockManager objects.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between the two BlockManager objects is done in a deterministic way to accurately check for equality. We can achieve this by modifying the canonicalize function to return a unique identifier for each block that enables accurate comparison across different BlockManager objects.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block),)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This version of the function fixes the bug by using the id() function to generate a unique identifier for each block. This ensures that the comparison of blocks between the two BlockManager objects is done accurately and guarantees the correct result when checking for equality.

With this correction, the provided failing test case should now pass as expected.
