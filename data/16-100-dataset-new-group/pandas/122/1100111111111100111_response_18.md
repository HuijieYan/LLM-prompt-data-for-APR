The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return True incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames. This is due to the order of the blocks being considered before the comparison. To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to also include the block's index, ensuring a correct comparison by combining the dtype name, block locations, and block index when sorting the blocks.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, block index, and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, self.blocks.index(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block's index in addition to the dtype and block locations, the bug is fixed and the `equals` function should now return the correct result when comparing DataFrames.
