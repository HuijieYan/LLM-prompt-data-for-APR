To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue with comparing blocks with different locations. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

One potential cause of the bug is the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, where the ordering may result in mismatched comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks accounts for their actual contents rather than their locations in memory.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, we removed the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. Instead, we directly compare each block in `self_blocks` with the corresponding block in `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. This change ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
