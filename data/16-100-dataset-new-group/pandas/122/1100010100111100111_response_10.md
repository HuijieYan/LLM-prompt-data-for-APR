### Correction

Based on the input values and types, the bug seems to be related to the `canonicalize` function and the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The issue reported in GitHub also confirms that the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The buggy function is not handling the sorting of the blocks properly, leading to incorrect comparison and returning `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting process for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal. Specifically, the `canonicalize` function should consider block manager locations for the comparison.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # consider block manager locations for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now considers block manager locations, ensuring that blocks with identical data but different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and properly handle the comparison of blocks within the `equals` method.
