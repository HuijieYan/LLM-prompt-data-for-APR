The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to wrongly return `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations. The buggy function is designed to compare the internal block structure of the DataFrame objects.

The bug in the function is related to the comparison of block structures without considering the block locations. This results in incorrect equality comparisons for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix the bug, the function should first ensure that the block locations are taken into account when comparing the internal block structures of the DataFrame objects. This will ensure that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations will not be incorrectly deemed as equal.

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        # Consider block locations when comparing
        def block_equals(block, oblock):
            return block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected function, a new `block_equals` function is introduced to compare each block in terms of both their data and their locations. This ensures that when comparing the blocks, their locations are considered as well, preventing the function from incorrectly returning `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

This fix will address the GitHub issue and allow the `DataFrame.equals()` method to behave as expected, returning `False` for cases of identical blocks with different locations.
