To fix the buggy function `equals`, we need to address the issue where it is not comparing the dataframes correctly. The issue is that the function is not handling the comparison of the dataframe blocks correctly. The bug is in the logic of canonicalizing the blocks for comparison. The bug leads to the function not correctly identifying the two dataframes as unequal, even when their content is the same. 

To fix this, we need to update the canonicalize function to correctly identify the blocks for comparison and use it to compare the blocks of two dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.get_values())

    self_blocks_canonical = [canonicalize(block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_canonical = [canonicalize(block) for block in other.blocks]

    return self_blocks_canonical == other_blocks_canonical
```

With this corrected version, the function should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
