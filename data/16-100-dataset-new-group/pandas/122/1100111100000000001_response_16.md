Potential Error Locations:
1. The function `canonicalize` is defined twice, once in the class and once outside the class. This may cause confusion and result in unexpected behavior.
2. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may not work as intended if the `canonicalize` function does not produce unique and consistent results for each block.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function and its use inside the `equals` function. The inconsistent use of this function and its potential to produce different results may lead to incorrect comparisons between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the duplicated definition of the `canonicalize` function and only use the one defined within the `BlockManager` class.
2. Ensure that the `canonicalize` function consistently produces unique and deterministic results for each block.

Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions...

    # Define the canonicalize function inside the class
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Fixed version of the equals function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
