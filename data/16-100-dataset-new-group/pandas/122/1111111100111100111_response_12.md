## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. When comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances, the function wrongly returns `True` even if the blocks have different locations. This behavior is causing the failing test case, where two dataframes with columns swapped are compared using the `equals` function, and it incorrectly returns `True`.

The issue is with the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. However, when initializing the `BlockPlacement` object to get the manager locations, the `as_array` method is incorrectly called using `.tolist()`. This causes the incorrect sorting of blocks based on their locations and leads to the wrong comparison result in the `equals` function.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the call to the `as_array` method with `.tolist()` needs to be corrected. Instead, the `mgr_locs` should be directly used without the `.tolist()` call when creating the tuple for canonicalization.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected canonicalize function to use mgr_locs without .tolist()
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should sort the blocks correctly based on their type name and manager locations, leading to the expected comparison result between two `BlockManager` instances. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug as well.
