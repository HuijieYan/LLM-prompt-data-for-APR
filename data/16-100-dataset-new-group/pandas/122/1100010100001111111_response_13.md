The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two BlockManager instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, there is a bug causing it to return incorrect results.

The potential error location is identified in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. It is likely that the bug is caused by the incorrect comparison or sorting of blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not correctly identifying and sorting the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly identifies and sorts the blocks. We can accomplish this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include both the type name and the location of the blocks in the comparison and sorting process.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the type name of the block in the tuple, along with the `mgr_locs`, to ensure that the blocks are correctly distinguished and sorted for comparison. This should resolve the bug and produce the expected output as per the GitHub issue.
