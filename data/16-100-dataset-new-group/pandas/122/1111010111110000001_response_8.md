The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two DataFrames for equality. It is failing the test because it returns `True` when it should actually return `False`.

The buggy function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It then sorts the blocks and checks if each block is equal to the corresponding block in the other `BlockManager`. However, it does not handle the case where the contents of the blocks are different.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not compare the actual values within the blocks of the DataFrames, it only checks if the blocks have the same dtype and manager locations. This results in a false positive for equality.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare the actual data within the blocks as well as checking the dtype and manager locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the blocks for actual equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, we added `np.array_equal` to compare the values within the blocks for actual equality.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
