The error message indicates that the `equals()` method is not working as expected and is returning True when it should be returning False. This is causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks.

The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function not correctly distinguishing between the data in the two DataFrames. It is using the block's dtype name and mgr_locs, which might not be sufficient to distinguish between the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to come up with a better way to distinguish between the blocks, ensuring that unconsolidated blocks (e.g., Categorical) are correctly identified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Use a combination of block values and data types to distinguish between blocks
        return (block.values, block.dtypes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses a combination of block values and data types to distinguish between the blocks. This should ensure that the `equals()` method works correctly and the test will pass.
