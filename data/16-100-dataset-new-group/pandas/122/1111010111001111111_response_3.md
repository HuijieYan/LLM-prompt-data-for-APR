The bug in the `equals` function arises from incorrect comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager. The function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. The issue is that the function does not consider the difference in block locations when comparing the blocks. To fix this bug, we should update the logic in the function to include consideration of block locations when comparing the blocks.

Below is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Ensure that the axes are equal
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Create a function to canonicalize block order, combining type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    # Sort the blocks based on the canonicalization function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the sorted, canonicalized blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` in the canonicalization process. Additionally, we have sorted the blocks based on the updated canonicalization and then compared the sorted, canonicalized blocks to resolve the bug.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and satisfy the expected input/output values. It will also address the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly handled.
