To fix this bug, we need to identify potential error locations in the `equals` function and provide a corrected version. The `equals` function is trying to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. The bug is causing it to return an incorrect result when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The potential error locations in the `equals` function are:
1. Comparison of the axes.
2. Consolidation of blocks.
3. Canonicalization of blocks.
4. Comparison of individual blocks.

The bug is causing the `equals` function to return `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, resulting in an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to redefine the comparison logic in the `equals` function to handle the case where DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations. We need to compare the blocks themselves rather than their orders or locations.

Here is the fixed version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub. It addresses the incorrect comparison of identical blocks with different locations and ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks.
