## Correction of the Bug

### Error location
The buggy function is failing to properly compare two DataFrames and return the correct result.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once in the class and once outside the class, and the one within the class is not being used. This leads to incorrect sorting and comparison, causing the function to return an incorrect result.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the redundant `canonicalize` function and update the `canonicalize` function within the class to handle block sorting correctly.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # ... (other methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

### Assessment
The corrected version of the function removes the redundant `canonicalize` function and uses the `canonicalize` function within the class to sort the blocks correctly before comparison. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result.

With this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
