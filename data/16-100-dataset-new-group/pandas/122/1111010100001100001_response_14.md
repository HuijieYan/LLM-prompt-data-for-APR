The buggy function "equals" is comparing two BlockManager objects, checking if their axes, number of blocks, and the blocks themselves are equal. However, the comparison of the blocks is incorrect due to sorting them based on their type name and then mgr_locs.

The cause of the bug is that the sorting of the blocks is not accounting for different scenarios where blocks could be unconsolidated. This can lead to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we should change the comparison logic for the blocks to handle unconsolidated blocks and the iteration order. We can modify the canonicalize function to include additional attributes of the blocks for a more accurate sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function now includes block.values in addition to dtype name and mgr_locs, ensuring a more thorough comparison of the blocks. This should fix the bug and ensure correct comparison of the BlockManager objects.
