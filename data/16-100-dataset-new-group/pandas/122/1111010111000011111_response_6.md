## Analysis and Bug Identification
The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library. It is used to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` checks if two dataframes are not equal, and it should return `False`.

The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not handle the case where identical blocks have different locations, causing it to return `True` incorrectly.

The buggy function `equals` contains several potential error locations that could cause the bug:
1. Comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Consolidation of the internal data structures using `_consolidate_inplace()`.
3. Sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
4. Iterative comparison of blocks using `all` and `zip`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` after sorting them. If identical blocks have different locations, the current sorting and comparison method will falsely indicate them as equal.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` needs to be modified to consider the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

## Corrected Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
  
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    # Get the consolidated blocks to ensure accurate comparison
    self_blocks = self.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks()
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
    
def get_blocks(self):
    # Helper function to consolidate and retrieve blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    return sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.shape, block.dtypes))
``` 

The corrected function uses a helper method `get_blocks` to consolidate the blocks before comparison to ensure accurate results. It addresses the issue of identical blocks with different locations by sorting and comparing the consolidated blocks based on their shape and data types.

This modification should resolve the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result for the failing test case.
