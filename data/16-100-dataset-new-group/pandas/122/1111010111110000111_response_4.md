The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas` library is causing the `DataFrame.equals` method to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it instead returns `True`, leading to an assertion error. This bug has been reported in GitHub issue #28839.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is the block canonicalization and sorting, where it compares the blocks of two `BlockManagers`.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations within the `BlockManagers`. This causes the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion to fail, as it's expecting a `False` result but receiving `True` instead.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to properly handle identical blocks with different locations, ensuring that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the two `BlockManagers`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to compare the block values along with their locations, it ensures that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function accurately reflects the equality of the two `BlockManagers`. This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion return `False` as expected.
