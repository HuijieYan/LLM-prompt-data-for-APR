The bug in the code is causing the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test case to fail. The `df1` and `df2` DataFrames are expected to be not equal, but the buggy function `equals` incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

The issue seems to be coming from the comparison of dtype names and block locations. The function loops through the blocks of `self` and `other` BlockManager objects and compares their attributes. However, it doesn't handle the case where the blocks have different dtype names or block locations, causing the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to account for the dtype names and block locations of the blocks being compared. Additionally, the block sorting logic needs to be adjusted to use a tuple of dtype names and block locations in order to accurately compare the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to include dtype names and block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these updates, the `equals` function should now correctly determine if two BlockManager objects are equal, resolving the failing test case.
