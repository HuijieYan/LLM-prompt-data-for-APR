To fix the bug, it is necessary to identify the issue causing the failing test. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file sets up two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. These DataFrames contain different data-type values for the same keys `a` and `b`. The test expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, indicating that the DataFrames are not equal.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy `equals` function at the time of the failing test, the `self_axes` and `other_axes` contain the same references. This could be a potential error location, as these values are not properly compared for equality. Moreover, the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are tuple objects of the blocks in the DataFrame, which need to be sorted to ensure proper equality comparison.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not ensure a correct comparison of the axis values, and the blocks are not sorted properly. This leads to equal blocks being considered unequal due to differences in their locations.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function can be modified to first compare `self_axes` and `other_axes` directly for equality. Then, the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` need to be sorted before being compared to ensure that their order does not affect the result.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.axes != other.axes:
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function starts by directly comparing the axes for equality. Then, it consolidates the blocks and sorts them based on a canonicalization function before comparing for equality. This ensures that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` would return the expected output of `False`.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".
