The bug in the `equals` function appears to be related to the comparison of the blocks in the `self` and `other` BlockManagers.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the way the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks using the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks. The `mgr_locs` attribute is not being correctly compared or handled, leading to incorrect sorting of the blocks and eventual failure of the equality comparison.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to comprehensively sort the blocks based on their properties, including `dtype` and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, we should ensure that the blocks are correctly consolidated before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the type of the block, its `dtype` name, and the `mgr_locs` attribute in the sorting key. This will ensure that the blocks are sorted comprehensively based on their properties before comparison.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
