## Correction to the buggy function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Use str() to get the dtype name as a string

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

## Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between the 'dtype' attribute of the blocks using 'block.dtype.name'. There is a possibility that 'block.dtype.name' may not always provide a consistent result. To address this inconsistency, in the corrected version, we use 'str(block.dtype)' to convert the 'dtype' to a string and ensure consistent comparison.

## Note
This correction is based on the assumption that the comparison between 'dtype' attributes is the cause of the bug. If the bug persists after this correction, further investigation into the comparison of other attributes may be needed.
