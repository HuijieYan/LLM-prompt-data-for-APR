Based on the error message and the expected input/output values, it seems that the bug may be caused by the incorrect comparison of two DataFrames using the `equals` method. It's likely that the bug lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. 

The bug seems to be that the function is not handling the comparison of two DataFrames correctly. Additionally, the function is referencing two private methods, `_consolidate_inplace`, and `canonicalize`, but there is no logic in the function to define these methods. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic is correctly implemented and that any references to undefined methods are removed.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In this corrected version:
- The comparison of axes is done in a loop to compare each axis individually.
- The blocks are sorted before comparison to ensure a consistent order for comparison.
- The comparison of individual blocks is also done in a loop.

This should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly compares two DataFrames.
