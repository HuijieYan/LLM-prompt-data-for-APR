Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks with different locations. The issue reported on GitHub confirms that the `equals` method returns True when it should return False due to identical blocks with different locations. This indicates a problem with the comparison logic inside the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function should be modified to correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs))
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
In the corrected version, I modified the comparison logic to sort the blocks based on their values and locations before performing the comparison. This update ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be correctly handled in the comparison.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
