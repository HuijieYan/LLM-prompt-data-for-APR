The bug in the equals function is causing the failing tests. The issue seems to be with the canonicalize function inside the equals function. The canonicalize function is used to sort the blocks, but it is not defined correctly and is causing the sorting to fail.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function needs to be defined correctly, and the sorting logic needs to be updated to use the correct parameters for sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # define the correct canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the equals function should now correctly sort the blocks and compare them, satisfying the expected input/output values for the failing tests.
