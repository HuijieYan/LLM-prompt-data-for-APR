The bug in the given equals function appears to be related to the comparison of two BlockManager objects, specifically in the comparison of the self.blocks and other.blocks tuples.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, resulting in the AssertionError.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be:
1. Comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks tuples.
2. Sorting and comparison of self_blocks and other_blocks lists.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of variables, it is found that the comparison of blocks is occurring between different block types, specifically IntBlock and ObjectBlock.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is not being done between different block types and that the sorting and comparison of self_blocks and other_blocks lists are accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.__repr__())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function is now returning the type of the block as a string and the representation of mgr_locs, and the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks is based on the modified canonicalize function. This should ensure that the comparison is done accurately, and the bug is fixed.
