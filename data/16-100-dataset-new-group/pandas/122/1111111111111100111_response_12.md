The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class seems to be incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the given test case. Upon analysis, the root cause of the bug is likely the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function.

The function compares the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, and if they are not equal, it returns `False`. Then it iterates through the axes and checks if all corresponding axes are equal. Following these checks, both `self` and `other` objects run the `_consolidate_inplace` method to consolidate their internal structure. Finally, the function compares the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If these lengths are not equal, it returns `False`. Then, it sorts the blocks using a canonicalization function and compares each pair of blocks to determine if they are equal.

The failure in the provided test case suggests that the comparison of blocks is where the bug may lie. The error message from the failing test confirms that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should be thoroughly reviewed and possibly rewritten. It's likely that the sorting and comparison of blocks based on canonicalization is not correctly identifying the differences between the two dataframes, resulting in the incorrect `True` return.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we traverse through each pair of axes and verify their equality. Then, we consolidate the internal structures of both objects. Finally, we compare each pair of blocks to ensure that they are equal. If any of these checks fail, the function returns `False`.
This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
