The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class from the `managers.py` file in the `pandas` library is causing the `DataFrame.equals` method to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and block contents. However, it is not handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations appropriately, leading to incorrect equality checks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of axes is not taking into consideration the block locations.
2. The canonicalization of blocks is based only on their data type and locations, which may not be sufficient for proper equality comparison.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly accounting for the block locations when comparing the blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. This leads to incorrect equality results for cases where the blocks have the same content but different locations.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to consider the block locations in addition to the data type when comparing the blocks between the two `BlockManager` objects. It should also ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(sorted(block.mgr_locs.indexer)))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now creates a tuple with the block's data type name and a sorted tuple of block locations. The `equals` function then sorts the blocks based on this canonical representation before comparing them to handle cases where identical blocks may have different locations.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test case and provide the expected output of `False` when comparing the given dataframes `df1` and `df2`. Additionally, it should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect equality comparison for identical blocks with different locations.
