## Corrections

The buggy function is `equals` within the `managers.py` file in the pandas library. The failing test directly corresponds to the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations." The failing test is aiming to compare two dataframes and assert that they are not equal, but the buggy function mistakenly returns True.

The cause of the bug is due to the internal handling of the block locations in the `equals` function. It sorts and compares the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, however, this logic is flawed and leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to modify the canonicalization or sorting logic used for block comparison within the `equals` function. This logic should be adjusted to compare the block contents more accurately and determine the equality of the dataframes. Specifically, changing how the blocks are sorted should resolve the issue.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort and compare blocks based on their contents
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the issue should be resolved, and the failing test should now pass. The sorting logic has been modified to sort and compare the blocks based on their actual values, ensuring that the equality comparison of the dataframes is accurate.
