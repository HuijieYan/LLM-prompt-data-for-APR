The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager objects based on their axes and blocks. However, there is an issue with comparing the blocks. The issue in the function is that it compares the blocks based on their location rather than their content. This causes the function to return `True` even when the content of the blocks is different but their locations are the same.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is based on their content rather than their location.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then
    # comparing the blocks based on their content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function creates a tuple with the block's type name and its values. This way, the blocks are compared based on their content rather than their location. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function returns the expected output.

With this fix, the `equals` function will accurately compare two BlockManager objects and return `True` only when their content matches, and `False` otherwise.
