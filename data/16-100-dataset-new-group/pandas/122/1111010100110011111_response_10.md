The buggy function `equals` is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to return `True` even in cases where the compared DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations. This is a known issue that has been reported on GitHub.

### Potential error locations:
1. The comparison of the axes from both DataFrames.
2. The comparison of the blocks from both DataFrames.
3. The sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

### Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of blocks in cases where the blocks have identical data but different locations. This results in the method incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function needs to be modified to correctly account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. This can be achieved by implementing a more robust block comparison method that considers the actual block values rather than just the locations.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self_blocks = self._get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other._get_blocks()
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that the comparison of blocks takes into account the actual values and not just the locations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
