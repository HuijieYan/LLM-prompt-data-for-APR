## Explanation

The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances. It first checks the axes of both instances and returns False if their lengths are not equal or if any of the corresponding axes are not equal. Then, it calls the `_consolidate_inplace` method on both instances, which may have the effect of consolidating the blocks within each `BlockManager`. Finally, it compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances by sorting them and then checking for equality using the `equals` method on each block.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager`. Since there can be unconsolidated blocks (such as Categorical) which may have different locations, the current implementation does not account for this distinction. As a result, the comparison may return True even if the blocks are not exactly the same but have different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to consider their contents and location. We can handle this by creating a new canonicalized representation of the blocks that takes into account both the type name and the block's locations. This canonicalization can then be used to compare the blocks more accurately.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # New canonicalize function considering block type name and locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        # Sort the blocks using the new canonicalize function
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        # Check for equality of canonicalized blocks
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected implementation, the comparison of the blocks takes into account their type name along with their locations, ensuring that unconsolidated blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and should now correctly return False for the failing test case provided.
