### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug appears to be related to the way the blocks are being compared for equality. Since the blocks are sorted before comparison based on their dtype name and mgr_locs, but there might be a scenario where identical blocks have different locations, leading to an incorrect equality comparison. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `equals` function to compare the blocks more accurately, taking into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a dictionary of canonicalized blocks for both self and other
    self_canonical = {}
    for block in self.blocks:
        key = (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
        self_canonical[key] = block

    other_canonical = {}
    for block in other.blocks:
        key = (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
        other_canonical[key] = block

    # Check if the canonicalized blocks are equal in both self and other
    return self_canonical == other_canonical
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of comparing identical blocks with different locations. It constructs a dictionary of canonicalized blocks for both `self` and `other`, where the key is a combination of the dtype name and the `mgr_locs` in byte format. Then, it checks if the canonicalized blocks are equal in both `self` and `other` using dictionary comparison.

The corrected version should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
