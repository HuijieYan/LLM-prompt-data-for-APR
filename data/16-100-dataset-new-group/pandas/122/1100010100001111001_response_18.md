The buggy function has an issue with the comparison of the blocks for equality. It is not comparing the blocks correctly, and there is a potential issue with the `canonicalize` function.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison between the blocks and the use of the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks. The `canonicalize` function is not properly capturing the unique properties of the blocks, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to accurately capture the unique properties of the blocks. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks for equality should be updated to use the modified `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
