The buggy function `equals` in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` currently has a bug where it wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations." The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects and returns `True` if they are equal, but the bug causes it to incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

The potential error location is within the block sorting and comparison logic in the function. The function sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` and then compares each pair of blocks. There might be a bug in the sorting or comparison logic that causes blocks with different locations to wrongly be considered equal.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect comparison of blocks that have identical data but different locations within the `BlockManager` objects. This comparison inconsistency leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing `BlockManager` objects with the same data but different block locations.

To fix the bug, the sorting and comparison logic for the blocks should be modified to consider the block locations as part of the equality check. This will ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, hash(block.get_values().tobytes()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function generates a tuple using the block's `dtype.name` and a hash of the block's data to include the block locations in the comparison. This ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.
