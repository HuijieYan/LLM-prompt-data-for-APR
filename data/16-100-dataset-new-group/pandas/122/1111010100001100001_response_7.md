## Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to how it compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function sorts and compares the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but the sorting doesn't seem to be working correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug fix strategy should include checking for any issues with the sorting of the blocks and ensuring that the comparison between the blocks is accurate.

## Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I've modified the `canonicalize` function to convert `block.dtype` to a string and removed the unnecessary conversion to a list using `as_array.tolist()`. This ensures a correct comparison between the blocks.
