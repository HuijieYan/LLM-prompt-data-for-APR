The bug in the given function `equals` is that it compares the blocks of `self` and `other` without considering their order. The function sorts the blocks by their `dtype` and `mgr_locs` and then compares them using the `equals` method. However, the bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the class and once inside the class, but only the function outside the class is used. This causes the `canonicalize` function inside the class to be unreachable and not used in the sorting key.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be used from within the class rather than from outside the class.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using the method from the same class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
