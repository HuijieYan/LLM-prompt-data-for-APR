The `equals` function compares two BlockManager instances to check if they are equal. It does this by comparing their axes and blocks. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. The comparison of the lengths of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not be accurate.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` may not be correct.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not comparing the values of the DataFrame correctly. It is comparing the axes and blocks, but it should be comparing the actual data. This is evident from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` which compares two DataFrames and expects them to be unequal, but the `equals` function returns True.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare the actual data in the DataFrame rather than just the axes and blocks. This can be achieved by adding a comparison of the actual data values.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # compare the axes
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    # compare the actual data values
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        block = self.blocks[i]
        oblock = other.blocks[i]
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, it should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` as it correctly compares the actual data values of the DataFrames.
