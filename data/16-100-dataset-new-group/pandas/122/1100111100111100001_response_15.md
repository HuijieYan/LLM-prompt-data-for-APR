The bug in the provided function is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice within the same class, which is not allowed in Python. This causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to the failing test case.

To fix the bug, the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function needs to be addressed. It should be removed from the class and defined as a standalone function. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to correctly process the input `block` and return a tuple of the type name and `mgr_locs` of the block.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # definition of other functions...

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By making these changes, the `canonicalize` function is defined only once, and it correctly handles the blocks and returns a tuple that can be used for sorting and comparison. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
