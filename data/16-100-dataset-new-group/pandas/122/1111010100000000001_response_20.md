- Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.

- Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic may not be handling all edge cases correctly.
2. The sorting of blocks and their comparison.

- Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function can be due to the incorrect comparison of blocks and sorting logic, causing it to produce incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.

- Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the comparison logic to ensure it correctly handles all possible edge cases.
2. Check the sorting logic to ensure it sorts the blocks properly before comparing.

- Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.astype(str).tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the comparison logic is improved using `for` loops to compare axes and blocks. The sorting logic is also updated to use the dtype and mgr_locs of the blocks to ensure a proper comparison. Additionally, the function now returns `True` when all comparisons are successful, indicating equality between the two `BlockManager` instances.
