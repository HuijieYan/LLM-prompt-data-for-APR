Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the comparison of DataFrame objects using the `equals` method. It has been reported that the `equals` method is returning `True` even when the DataFrame objects have identical blocks with different locations.

The buggy function `equals` is comparing self and other blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which is causing the issue. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. However, it seems that the ordering is not consistent with the actual data, which leads to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the sorting mechanism for the blocks needs to be revisited to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.values.tostring()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.values.tostring()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been removed and replaced with a lambda function for sorting the blocks based on their type and values. This change ensures that the comparison is based on the actual block values rather than their locations.

With this correction, the `equals` method should now return the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks and different locations. It will address the issue reported on GitHub.
