The buggy function is the `equals` function within the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two dataframes using the `equals` method, but it is resulting in an assertion error.

The potential error location in the `equals` function could be related to the method of comparison or block order canonicalization.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not correctly handling the comparison of the two dataframes as evidenced by the assertion error in the failing test. The error message specifically states that the comparison is resulting in `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to correctly compare the dataframes and ensure that it returns `False` when the dataframes are not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Ensure that the dataframes have the same dtypes and values
    if not self.applymap(pd.api.types.is_list_like) and not other.applymap(pd.api.types.is_list_like):
        if not self.values.equals(other.values):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version should handle the comparison of the dataframes correctly and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes without any assertion errors.
