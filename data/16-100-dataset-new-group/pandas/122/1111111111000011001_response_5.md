To fix the buggy function, we need to address the following issues:

1. The function `canonicalize` is redefined within the `BlockManager` class and does not take any parameters. However, it is called with a parameter `block` within the `equals` function. This will lead to a `TypeError` when sorting the blocks.

2. The method `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` are called without being defined within the `BlockManager` class. It seems that these methods should be inherited from another class or implemented within the `BlockManager` class.

3. There is a missing import statement for the pandas package at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import pandas as pd

class BlockManager:
    # (previous class implementation)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        # Consolidate blocks in place
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        for block in self.blocks:
            if not isinstance(block, pd.core.internals.blocks.Block):
                return False

        for block in other.blocks:
            if not isinstance(block, pd.core.internals.blocks.Block):
                return False

        # Define a function to canonicalize the block
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice().tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Please note that the implementation above assumes that `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are instances of `pd.core.internals.blocks.Block` based on the provided test case. If this assumption is incorrect, further modifications may be necessary.
