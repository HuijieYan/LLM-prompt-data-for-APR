The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager`. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` creates two dataframes, `df1` and `df2`, and checks if they are not equal by using the `equals` method, which is expected to return `False`. However, the current implementation of the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` is failing, which confirms that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" further explains that the `equals` method is not functioning as expected and provides a sample code that fails the test.

To fix this bug, the `equals` method should be updated to correctly compare the block locations and return the expected result by identifying the different locations as a reason for inequality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This corrected version of the `equals` function should now return the expected result, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
