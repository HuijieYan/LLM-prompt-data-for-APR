Based on the provided information, the buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The issue reported on GitHub states that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This means that the function is not properly comparing blocks from two dataframes and returning the correct result.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Checking the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
2. Sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize`.
3. Using the `equals` method to compare individual blocks.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be occurring due to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method. There seems to be a problem with the sorting and comparison logic, which results in incorrect results when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic used to compare the blocks in the `equals` method.
2. Ensure that the logic for sorting and comparing the blocks is correct and handles cases where blocks have different locations but contain the same data.

Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# imports and other class declarations as necessary

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other class methods

    
    # this is the corrected equals method
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        # Check if the blocks in both dataframes are equal
        def blocks_are_equal(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
                return False
            for b1, b2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
                if not b1.equals(b2):
                    return False
            return True
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return blocks_are_equal(self_blocks, other_blocks)
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method addresses the bug by implementing a new `blocks_are_equal` function that ensures proper comparison of individual blocks within the dataframes. This function checks if the number of blocks are equal and then iterates through each block to compare them properly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub where the `equals` method wrongly returned `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
