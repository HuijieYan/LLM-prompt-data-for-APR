The bug in the `equals` function is that it incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with different block locations but identical content. This issue causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to raise an AssertionError.

The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Sorting and comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on block type and locations.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic in the `equals` function does not properly account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, a corrected version of the `equals` function should compare the content of the blocks directly, rather than relying on the block locations for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Compare block content directly
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock, try_cast=False):
            return False
    
    return True
```

The `equals` function now directly compares each block in `self` and `other` using the `equals` method of the `block` class, and the `try_cast` parameter set to `False` to ensure strict comparison.

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should pass the failing test and correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
