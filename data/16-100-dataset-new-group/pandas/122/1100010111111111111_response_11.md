The bug in the `equals` function appears to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, leading to incorrect equality results. This is evident from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and the corresponding error message, which indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The buggy function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations, but this sorting process seems to be leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects should be re-implemented to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly
    self_block_set = {(block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes()) for block in self.blocks}
    other_block_set = {(block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes()) for block in other.blocks}

    return self_block_set == other_block_set
```

In the corrected version, the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects are compared directly using a set of tuples containing the type name and the block values converted to bytes. This approach ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

After applying this correction, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test should pass, and the `equals` function should return the expected output of `False` for the given input data. This correction should also resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
