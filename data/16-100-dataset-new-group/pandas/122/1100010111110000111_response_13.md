The buggy function is the `equals` function in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The error message from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` indicates that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should return `False`. The corresponding GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" also points to the same problem.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting might be causing the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function used in sorting the blocks does not correctly account for the case where identical blocks have different locations. This leads to an incorrect comparison and causes the `equals` function to return `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to account for both the type name and the block locations. Then, use the modified `canonicalize` function for sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # type name and block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses a tuple containing the type name and block locations for sorting the blocks. This ensures that the comparison in the `equals` function handles cases where identical blocks have different locations correctly.
