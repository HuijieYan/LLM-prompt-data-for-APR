The buggy function `equals` in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is causing an assertion error in the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.

The potential error location in the buggy function `equals` is the comparison of two dataframes using the `.equals` method.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not handling the comparison of dataframes with different data types for columns. This results in a misleading error message and the assertion error in the test function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to handle the comparison of dataframes with different data types for columns. One strategy to fix the bug is to first check if the column data types are the same before comparing the dataframes using the `equals` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return False

    if len(self.index) != len(other.index):
        return False
    
    if len(self.columns) != len(other.columns):
        return False

    for col1, col2 in zip(self.columns, other.columns):
        if self[col1].dtype != other[col2].dtype:
            return False

    return (self.values == other.values).all()
```

This corrected version checks for the length of the index and columns, and then iterates through each column to compare their data types before comparing the values. This should fix the bug and make the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
