The buggy function contains a call to self._consolidate_inplace() and the error message indicates that there is an issue with the comparison between the two dataframes. The error message also shows that the assertion is evaluating as True instead of False.

The cause of the bug is that the two dataframes are not being properly compared due to potential differences in order. Additionally, there is an issue with the internal consolidation of the data.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the dataframes are properly compared without being affected by differences in order, and the internal consolidation should be reviewed for potential issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    self_blocks = self._data.blocks
    other_blocks = other._data.blocks
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the function will properly compare the dataframes and ensure that the internal data blocks are consolidated before the comparison. This should resolve the issue highlighted by the failing test.
