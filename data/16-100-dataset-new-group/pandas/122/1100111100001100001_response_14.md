The bug in the function appears to be related to the sorting of the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function. 

Looking at the `canonicalize` function, it seems that it is defined twice, once outside the class and once inside the class. This could lead to a scope issue when the function is called. Additionally, within the `canonicalize` function, the `.as_array` attribute is accessed, which might be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should first remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function and make sure that the correct version is being called. Then, we should verify that the `mgr_locs` attribute within the `canonicalize` function is being accessed correctly.

Based on the given runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the `.as_array` attribute should be accessed as `block.mgr_locs.as_array()`, rather than `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Remove the duplicate definition of the canonicalize function

    # Corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function has been removed, and the correct access to the `as_array` attribute has been implemented.
