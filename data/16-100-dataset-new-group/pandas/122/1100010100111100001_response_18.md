The current function `equals` is comparing the axes and blocks of two BlockManager objects for equality. However, it is not handling the case where the data types of the elements in the columns of the DataFrames are not the same. This is causing the function to return `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to compare the data types of the elements in the columns of the DataFrames before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check if the data types of elements in the columns are the same
    if not all(block.dtype == oblock.dtype for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the added check for data types, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
