The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class has a bug that causes it to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes of the two dataframes are different, and if so, it returns `False`. Then, it checks if each axis of the two dataframes is equal. If they are not, it returns `False`. Next, it consolidates the inplace self and other dataframes using the `_consolidate_inplace` function, then checks if the lengths of the blocks of the two dataframes are different. If they are, it returns `False`. Finally, it sorts the blocks and checks if each block is equal to the corresponding block in the other dataframe.

The bug is caused by the incorrect ordering of the blocks, leading to the function wrongly returning `True` for dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix the bug, the sorting of the blocks needs to be corrected to account for the different locations of identical blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, id(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `id(block)` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to uniquely identify blocks. This way, identical blocks with different locations will be sorted correctly, and the `equals` function will return the correct result.

The corrected version of the `equals` function should now successfully pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
