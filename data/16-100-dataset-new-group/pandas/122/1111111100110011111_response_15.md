### Bug Analysis
The `BlockManager.equals()` function does not correctly identify when two DataFrames are not equal. This is causing the failing test case, as evidenced by the error message and the GitHub issue. The function is not properly comparing the axes, consolidating the data in place, and sorting the blocks for comparison.

### Error Location
The potential error locations in the buggy function include:
1. Improper comparison of axes using `ax1.equals(ax2)` in a list comprehension
2. Not consolidating the data in place for both `self` and `other` objects
3. Sorting the blocks for comparison using a custom function `canonicalize` that is not properly implemented

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the `BlockManager.equals()` function not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of the two DataFrames. This is leading to a false positive in the comparison check, which is incorrectly returning `True` when the two DataFrames are not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `BlockManager.equals()` function, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Ensure that both `self` and `other` objects have their data consolidated in place before the comparison.
2. Sort the blocks for comparison using a proper implementation of the `canonicalize` function.
3. Simplify the axis comparison using a more robust method.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By following this approach, the bug should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
