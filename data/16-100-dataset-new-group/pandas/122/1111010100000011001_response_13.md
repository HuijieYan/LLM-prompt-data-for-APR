The buggy function "equals" is expected to compare the axes and blocks of two BlockManager objects and return True if they are equal, and False otherwise.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the comparison of axes and blocks between the two BlockManager objects.

The cause of the bug could be that the comparison logic within the function does not correctly handle the axes and blocks of the BlockManager objects.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is done correctly, taking into account the structure and content of the BlockManager objects.

Here is a corrected version of the "equals" function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if not block.equals(oblock):
                return False

        return True
```

In this corrected version, the comparison of axes and blocks is done using a loop to compare each block individually, ensuring that the comparison is accurate and the function returns the correct result.
