The bug in the function `equals` seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with different locations. The inputs `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are tuples of blocks, and the comparison logic within the function does not account for the possibility of blocks being in different locations.

Specifically, the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` need to be sorted based on their type name and `mgr_locs` in order to compare them in a consistent manner. The current implementation of the function does not handle this sorting effectively.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs` before comparison. This will ensure that blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
