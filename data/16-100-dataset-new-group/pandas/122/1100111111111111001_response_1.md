The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. 

The function fails when comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists because the `canonicalize` function does not seem to be correctly implemented. The `canonicalize` function should be able to correctly identify and order the blocks for comparison, but it appears to be incorrectly sorting the blocks. As a result, even when the blocks are equal, the comparison fails.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to ensure that it correctly identifies and orders the blocks for comparison.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function should correctly identify and order the blocks for comparison, and the `equals` function should pass the failing test.
