The bug in the provided code is likely related to the comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` lists, as well as the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples.

The failing test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` suggests that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This could be due to incorrect comparisons made within the `equals` method, specifically regarding the axes and blocks.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
- Ensure that the comparisons between `self_axes` and `other_axes` accurately reflect the equality of the axes in the two `BlockManager` instances.
- Make sure that the comparisons between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` correctly determine whether the blocks are equal.

Additionally, the implementation could be simplified by using built-in comparison methods or functions provided by the Pandas library.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes) or len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for axis1, axis2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes):
        if not axis1.equals(axis2):
            return False

    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, the method first checks if the number of axes and blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances are equal. Then, it iterates through the axes and blocks to compare each pair, returning `False` if any of the comparisons fail. If all comparisons pass, the method returns `True`.
