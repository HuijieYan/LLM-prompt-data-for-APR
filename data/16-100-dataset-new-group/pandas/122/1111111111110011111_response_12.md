To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue of incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. 

In the current implementation of the `equals` function, the comparison of blocks is done using the `equals` method, which may lead to incorrect results when comparing blocks with the same data but different locations. 

To fix this, we can modify the comparison approach to ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Group blocks by data type and content, and compare equality of grouped blocks
    self_block_groups = {}
    for block in self.blocks:
        key = (block.shape, block.dtypes, block.values)
        if key in self_block_groups:
            self_block_groups[key].append(block)
        else:
            self_block_groups[key] = [block]
    
    other_block_groups = {}
    for block in other.blocks:
        key = (block.shape, block.dtypes, block.values)
        if key in other_block_groups:
            other_block_groups[key].append(block)
        else:
            other_block_groups[key] = [block]
    
    # Check if the block groups in self and other are equal
    if len(self_block_groups) != len(other_block_groups):
        return False
    
    for key, self_group_blocks in self_block_groups.items():
        other_group_blocks = other_block_groups.get(key, [])
        if len(self_group_blocks) != len(other_group_blocks):
            return False
        for self_group_block, other_group_block in zip(self_group_blocks, other_group_blocks):
            if not self_group_block.equals(other_group_block):
                return False
    
    return True
```

With this updated implementation, the `equals` function now correctly compares the blocks of two DataFrames by grouping them based on their shape, data types, and values. It then checks for equality within each block group, ensuring that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as not equal. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `equals` function behave as expected.
