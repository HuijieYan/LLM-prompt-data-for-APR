The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class within the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. The bug causes `DataFrame.equals()` to wrongly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Mishandling of block locations leading to incorrect comparison results.
2. Sorting of blocks based on data type and location instead of comparing and sorting based on block data.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function first checks the lengths of the axes and returns False if they are not equal. Then, it consolidates the blocks in both self and other objects, and if the lengths of the blocks are not equal, it also returns False. However, the bug lies in the comparison of the blocks, where the current method sorts the blocks based on their data type and locations. This sorting method does not correctly compare the equality of the blocks, especially when they have different locations.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to implement a comparison method that first checks for the equality of block lengths and axes. Then, it should compare the actual block data for equality, regardless of their locations. This could involve directly comparing the block arrays, or using a method that compares blocks without considering their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks the length and equality of axes, followed by consolidating the blocks for both self and other objects. Then, it directly compares the blocks for equality without considering their locations, thus addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
