The bug in the equals function of the BlockManager class causes the test_dataframe_not_equal test to fail. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing. The test is comparing two DataFrames, df1 and df2, to check if they are not equal. However, the buggy equals function is not correctly comparing the internal blocks of the DataFrames, leading to the failure of the test.

The issue in the buggy equals function is related to the comparison of internal blocks. The function sorts the blocks using the canonicalize function, and then it iterates through the sorted blocks to check if they are equal. The problem is that the canonicalize function is not correctly implemented and does not handle the case of different data types in the blocks. This causes the sorted blocks to be incorrect, leading to the failure of the equality check.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function needs to be modified to properly handle different data types in the blocks. This will ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before the equality check.

Here is a corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function now uses the block's dtypes to distinguish blocks with different data types. This ensures that the blocks are sorted correctly before the equality check, fixing the bug that caused the failing test.
