To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises from the way block locations are compared and sorted. We need to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to include both the block locations (`mgr_locs`) and the block values. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal. This approach addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and should produce the expected output for the failing test.
