## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The if statement `if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes))` compares the equality of the axes of two DataFrames, but it does not handle the case where the axes are in different orders.

2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which could lead to issues if the blocks are not in the same order in both DataFrames.

## Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the function does not account for the possibility of the axes being in different orders in different DataFrames when checking for equality. Additionally, the sorting of the blocks based on `canonicalize` may not produce the correct result if the blocks are not in the same order in both DataFrames.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the comparison of axes in a way that accounts for potential differences in order. Additionally, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks considers the actual block content rather than just the block type and locations.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    # Check for equality of axes while accounting for potential differences in order
    if not all(
        any(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax2 in other_axes) for ax1 in self_axes
    ) or not all(
        any(ax2.equals(ax1) for ax1 in self_axes) for ax2 in other_axes
    ):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check for equality of blocks while considering the content rather than just the type and locations
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```
In the corrected version of the function, we compare the axes while accounting for differences in order by checking for equality in both directions. Additionally, we compare the blocks based on their content rather than just the type and locations. With these modifications, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
