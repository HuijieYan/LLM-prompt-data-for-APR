The bug in the provided function is related to the sorting of blocks. The function should be sorting the blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs, but it seems to be not sorting correctly due to a missing attribute or method.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to check if `mgr_locs` and `dtype.name` are present or accessible in the `block` object. It is also important to ensure that the attribute `equals` is valid and compares the blocks correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Sort the blocks and then compare
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, the function sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` using the `sorted` function with a lambda function as the sorting key. Then it compares the sorted lists to determine if the dataframes are equal.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
