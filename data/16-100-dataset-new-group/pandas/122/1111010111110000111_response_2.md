The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas package. The function is used to determine if two instances of the `BlockManager` class are equal. The function checks whether the axes and blocks of the two instances are equal and returns False if they are not. However, there is a bug in the function that causes it to return True when it should return False, as demonstrated by the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The bug occurs in the comparison of the `BlockManager` instances' blocks. The bug is causing the `equals` method to return True incorrectly.

The GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" describes a case where `df3.equals(df4)` incorrectly returns True even though `df3` and `df4` are not equal. The issue reports that the expected output should be False, but the function is returning True instead.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks within the `equals` method should be revised to correctly determine if the two instances are equal. It seems like the comparison is currently not overseeing the difference in the location of identical blocks.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks element-wise
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version corrects the issue of the original function by iterating over each block and comparing them individually to ensure that all blocks are equal. This strategy directly addresses the problem raised in the GitHub issue and is expected to resolve the failing test case.
