The buggy function is the "equals" method within the BlockManager class. The method is intended to compare two instances of the BlockManager class for equality. However, due to the use of the "canonicalize" function, which is defined both inside the BlockManager class and outside of it, there is confusion about which function is being called, leading to potential errors.

The cause of the bug is the use of the outer "canonicalize" function instead of the inner one defined within the BlockManager class. This can lead to incorrect comparison and sorting of the blocks, causing the equals method to produce incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the inner "canonicalize" function within the BlockManager class should be used instead of the outer one. This will ensure that the correct function is called and that the block comparison and sorting are performed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Use the inner canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
