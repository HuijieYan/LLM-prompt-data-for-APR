The buggy function is the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. This method is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. It first checks if the axes of the two instances are equal in length and then compares each axis. After that, it calls the `_consolidate_inplace` method on both instances, then compares the number of blocks in each instance, and finally, it attempts to canonicalize the block order and compare the blocks.

The potential error locations in the buggy function could be:
1. Calling the `_consolidate_inplace` method without checking for errors.
2. Sorting the blocks of the instances and comparing them without considering potential issues with sorting.

The cause of the bug could be related to the `_consolidate_inplace` method and the sorting of the blocks. If the `_consolidate_inplace` method has any issues, they might not be caught before comparing the number of blocks in each instance. Also, sorting the blocks without proper handling of specific data types could lead to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the `_consolidate_inplace` method works as expected before comparing the number of blocks. Additionally, when sorting the blocks, it's important to consider the specific properties of the data blocks to ensure accurate comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate inplace before comparing the number of blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    # Create a copy of the blocks to sort and compare
    self_blocks = self.blocks.copy()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.copy()
    self_blocks.sort(key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks.sort(key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `_consolidate_inplace` method is called before comparing the number of blocks. Additionally, a copy of the blocks is sorted and then compared to avoid modifying the original blocks.
