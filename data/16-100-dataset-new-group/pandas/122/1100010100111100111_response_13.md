### Bug Fix
This buggy function is incorrectly returning True instead of False when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method. This issue has been reported on GitHub and is caused by identical blocks with different locations. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations correctly.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to modify the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks and their locations.

### Modified and Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_tuples())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `canonicalize` function now uses `mgr_locs.to_tuples()` to properly represent the block locations. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly compared, addressing the bug reported on GitHub.
