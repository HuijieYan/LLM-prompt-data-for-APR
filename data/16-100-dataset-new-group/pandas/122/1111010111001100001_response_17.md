The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function is incorrectly sorting and comparing the blocks without considering the order of labels or types within the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's label as part of the sorting key in addition to the dtype and mgr_locs. This will ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their labels, types, and locations within the block.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and block labels
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block_items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
