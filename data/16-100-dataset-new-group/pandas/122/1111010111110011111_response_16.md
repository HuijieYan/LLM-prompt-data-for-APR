## Fixing the Bug
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return `True` when it should actually be returning `False`. The bug is related to the comparison of two dataframes with different values for the same columns.

To fix this bug, we need to compare the values of the blocks inside the dataframes rather than comparing the blocks themselves. This involves iterating through the blocks and comparing their actual data values.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self._data
    other_blocks = other._data
    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_blocks[i], other_blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function iterates through the blocks of both dataframes and uses `numpy.array_equal` to compare their values. This correctly identifies if the dataframes are equal or not.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
