The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the sorting of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple using the block's dtype name and the mgr_locs, which should be consistent. However, there might be issues with the `mgr_locs` due to unconsolidated blocks or other data inconsistencies, leading to incorrect sorting and comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function so that it handles unconsolidated blocks or discrepancies in the mgr_locs. We should also ensure that the sorting and comparison of blocks are consistent and accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to handle unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Generate a tuple using the block's dtype name and a hash of the block's content
        return (block.dtype.name, hash(block.values.tobytes()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include a hash of the block's content, we can ensure that unconsolidated blocks are handled consistently and accurately during sorting and comparison. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function pass the failing test.
