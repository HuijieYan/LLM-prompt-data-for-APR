The bug in the provided function is related to the way it sorts the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is declared twice, once in the global scope of the `BlockManager` class, and once inside the `equals` method. This could lead to confusion and ambiguity.

To fix the bug, the duplicate `canonicalize` function declaration must be removed and the `canonicalize` function should be defined at the class level outside of any method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ...

    def canonicalize_block(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize_block)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=self.canonicalize_block)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize_block` function is defined outside of any method, making it a class-level function that can be used as a key in the `sorted` function. The `canonicalize_block` function takes a block as input and returns the tuple that will be used for sorting.

This approach ensures that the `canonicalize` function is defined only once and is used consistently within the `equals` method, resolving the ambiguity and potential function resolution errors.
