## Fixing the Bug
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing blocks using `canonicalize` function to sort and compare the blocks. However, the issue lies in the comparison of `mgr_locs` within the `canonicalize` function, which leads to the incorrect comparison of blocks. 

To fix this issue, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider the `mgr_locs` of the block.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, we are now considering `mgr_locs` when sorting and comparing the blocks, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

The corrected function has been updated to consider `block.mgr_locs` within the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that the comparison of blocks takes into account the correct locations of the blocks.

This correction should address the issue and ensure that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output values.
