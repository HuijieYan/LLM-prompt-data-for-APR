The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is failing to correctly identify if two DataFrames are equal due to a bug within the `canonicalize` function, which is causing the DataFrame to return True when it should actually return False in the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The issue has been identified in GitHub as "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to properly compare the blocks in both DataFrames by their type name and `mgr_locs` to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal. This will prevent the DataFrame from incorrectly returning True when the blocks have the same content but different locations.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the issue identified in the GitHub bug report will be resolved, and the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test case will now pass, correctly identifying the two DataFrames as unequal.
