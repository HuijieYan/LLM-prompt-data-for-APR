The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrame objects `self` and `other` and is expected to return `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise. However, the issue on GitHub identifies a problem where the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The issue seems to be related to the comparison of blocks, specifically the block's type name and mgr_locs. The bug could potentially be caused by the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the comparison logic to consider the identical blocks with different locations as not equal.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare blocks directly
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

Here, we directly compare each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. If any blocks are not equal, the function will return `False`. Otherwise, it will return `True`, indicating that the DataFrames are equal.

This corrected version resolves the issue reported on GitHub and should satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
