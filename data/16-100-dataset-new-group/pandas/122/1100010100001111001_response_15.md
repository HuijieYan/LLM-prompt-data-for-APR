### Bug analysis
The buggy function is designed to compare two BlockManager objects. However, it appears that the comparison is failing when comparing the contents of the blocks within the BlockManager objects.

The bug is likely occurring when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. It seems that the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block is not being compared correctly, leading to an incorrect sorting and subsequently a false comparison.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to correctly compare the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks. Additionally, the comparison of the `block.equals(oblock)` statement needs to be thoroughly examined to ensure proper comparison.

### Corrected version
```python
class BlockPlacement:
    # Define the BlockPlacement class if it's necessary 
    pass

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now directly compares the `mgr_locs` attributes of the blocks. Additionally, the comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)` has been updated to ensure a correct comparison.
