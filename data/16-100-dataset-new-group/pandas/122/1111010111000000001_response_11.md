The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. This function is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. The failing test is `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`, which checks if two DataFrame instances are not equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Comparing the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering the order of the blocks.
2. Canonicalizing block order based on the type name and manager locations, which might not be a reliable way to ensure equality.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of the `equals` function does not correctly handle the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances. The function fails to account for the order of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve:
1. Ensuring that the blocks are compared in the correct order.
2. Implementing a more reliable way to canonicalize the block order for comparison.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Ensure the blocks are compared in the correct order
        self_ordered_blocks = [self.blocks[i] for i in sorted(range(len(self.blocks)), key=lambda k: (self.blocks[k].dtype.name, self.blocks[k].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))]
        other_ordered_blocks = [other.blocks[i] for i in sorted(range(len(other.blocks)), key=lambda k: (other.blocks[k].dtype.name, other.blocks[k].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))]
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_ordered_blocks, other_ordered_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on the type name and manager locations before comparison, ensuring that they are compared in the correct order. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
