The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of the blocks and their comparison. The issue on GitHub suggests that the `equals` function is wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations, when it should return False.

Based on the provided runtime values and types of the variables, it appears that the bug may be related to the comparison of the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` in the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks takes into account their actual content, rather than just their order.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Comparison of blocks based on their content
    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other_blocks) for block in self_blocks
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use a nested loop to compare each block in `self_blocks` with all blocks in `other_blocks`, returning True if a match is found.

This should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the content of the blocks instead of their order.
