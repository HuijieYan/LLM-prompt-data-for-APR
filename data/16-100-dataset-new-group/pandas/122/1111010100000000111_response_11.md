The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` in cases where the data and block locations are identical, but the order of the blocks is different. This is not the expected behavior as per the issue description on GitHub, and the `equals` function should return `False` in such cases.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to compare the blocks using a different approach that takes into account the order of the blocks as well.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    return True
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` function iterates through each block in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and compares them individually. If any of the blocks are not equal, it will return `False`, otherwise, it will return `True`.

This change should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue, ensuring that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks and returns the expected result.
