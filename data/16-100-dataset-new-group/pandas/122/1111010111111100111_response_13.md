The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail. The method compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal. It appears that the comparison logic has a flaw, leading to an incorrect return value.

The `equals` method proceeds to compare the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances by length and then by equality of each corresponding axis. After that, it consolidates the block data and compares the number and content of the blocks. Eventually, it sorts and compares the blocks based on their data type and location.

However, the bug is likely causing the method to return `True` when it should return `False`. This is reflected in the failing test, which expects `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False` but receives `True` instead. The main issue arises from the incorrect comparison of the block data itself.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method needs to be revisited. Specifically, the comparison of the blocks based on data type and location should be reviewed to ensure it produces the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = [(block.values, block.mgr_locs) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.values, block.mgr_locs) for block in other.blocks]
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method fixes the comparison logic for the block data. It now compares the values and the location of each block, ensuring that the comparison is done correctly. With this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
