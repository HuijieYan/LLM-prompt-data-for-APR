To fix the bug in the given function, we need to address the condition that checks if two dataframes are equal. The bug may be in the `canonicalize` function or in the comparison of the blocks.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison between the two dataframes. The bug may be in the `canonicalize` function or in the comparison of the blocks. Based on the error message and the failing test, the function `equals` is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing `df1` and `df2`. This indicates that the comparison logic inside the function is not working as intended.

A potential bug in the `canonicalize` function is that it may not be correctly comparing the blocks. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method might not be implemented correctly, leading to the incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly compares the blocks and that the comparison using the `equals` method is implemented properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function compares the block values and their placement. The comparison of blocks is done using the `equals` method, ensuring that the correct comparison logic is applied.
