Based on the information provided, the issue seems to be related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method returning True for two DataFrames with identical blocks, but different locations. This is evident in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` where `df1.equals(df2)` is expected to return False, but it actually returns True.

The cause of the bug could be the implementation of the `equals()` method in the buggy function. The function compares the axes and blocks of two DataFrames, but it does not take into account the locations of the blocks. For the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have the same blocks but with different locations, causing the `equals()` method to incorrectly return True.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `equals()` method to consider the locations of the blocks when comparing two DataFrames.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and position because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block, position):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), position)

    self_blocks = sorted([(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(other.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the position of the block in addition to its dtype and mgr_locs. The blocks are sorted based on this tuple, ensuring that the blocks are compared taking into account their locations.

This modification should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and make the `equals()` method correctly identify when two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.
