The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class causes it to return True instead of False for two dataframes that are not equal. The issue arises due to the mishandling of block locations, resulting in the incorrect comparison of the blocks in the dataframes.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the block locations in the dataframes are properly handled and not misinterpreted during comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = [(block.shape, block.values) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.shape, block.values) for block in other.blocks]
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

With this correction, the method will now accurately compare the blocks in the dataframes and return the correct result for the equality comparison.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
