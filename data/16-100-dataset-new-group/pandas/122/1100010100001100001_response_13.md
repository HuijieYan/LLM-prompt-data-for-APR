The issue with the buggy function seems to be with the sorting of the blocks and the comparison using the `equals` method. The `canonicalize` function is used to create a tuple that combines the type name and `mgr_locs` to sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. However, the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method is not functioning correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the `mgr_locs` into the tuple and also ensure that the `equals` method is working correctly for the block comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the `mgr_locs` into the tuple returned by the `canonicalize` function and ensuring that the `equals` method is correctly comparing the blocks, we can fix the bug in the function.
