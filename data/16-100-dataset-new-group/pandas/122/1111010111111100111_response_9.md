The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to wrongly return True in cases of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue. This is occurring due to the incorrect comparison and sorting of the blocks and their locations.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to correctly compare and sort the blocks and their locations before checking for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self_blocks = self.blocks.to_dict()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.to_dict()
    self_blocks = {k: v.consolidate() for k, v in self_blocks.items()}
    other_blocks = {k: v.consolidate() for k, v in other_blocks.items()}
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        (self_blocks[k] == other_blocks[k]).all()
        for k in self_blocks.keys()
        if k in other_blocks
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare and sort the blocks and their locations, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
