The bug in the equals function is that it sorts the blocks of the DataFrame based on the block's dtype and mgr_locs, which can cause unexpected behavior when comparing DataFrames.

The bug can be fixed by implementing a new method for comparing DataFrame objects. 

Here's a corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_values = self.get_values()
    other_values = other.get_values()
    
    return (self_values == other_values).all()
```

This new implementation directly compares the values of the DataFrames, ensuring that they are the same, rather than trying to sort and compare the internal block structure, which was causing the issue.
