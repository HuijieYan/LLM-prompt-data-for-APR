The buggy function has a few potential errors:

1. The function is trying to compare the equality of two objects, but it's not clear what type of objects "self" and "other" are.
2. The function uses the "equals" method, which may raise an error if it's not defined for the objects being compared.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not checking whether the objects being compared have an "equals" method defined. If this method is not defined, it will raise an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the "equals" method is defined for the objects being compared. We can also add a type check to ensure that "self" and "other" are of the same type before trying to compare them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if type(self) != type(other):
        return False

    if not hasattr(self, 'equals') or not callable(getattr(self, 'equals')):
        return False

    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the "self" and "other" objects are of the same type. Then, we check if the "equals" method is defined and callable for the objects being compared. If any of these checks fail, the function returns False. Otherwise, it proceeds with the comparison as before.
