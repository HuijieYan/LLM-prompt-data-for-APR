The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The function fails to return the correct value in certain cases, as demonstrated by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. 

On analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it appears that the issue lies in the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The blocks are being sorted and compared using the `canonicalize` function, which creates a tuple based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs`. However, the buggy function fails to consider the case where two blocks have identical elements but different locations. This leads to the incorrect result when comparing the two block managers for equality.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison process of the blocks to consider the element-wise comparison of the blocks, instead of just the dtype and `mgr_locs`. This will ensure that the equality comparison considers the actual contents of the blocks, rather than just their types and locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # First check if number of blocks is equal, then compare the blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we iterate over each block in the managers and perform an element-wise comparison using the `equals` method for each block. This ensures that the comparison considers the actual contents of the blocks, addressing the issue of identical blocks with different locations.

After implementing this fix, the `equals` function should return the correct result for the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
