The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return False incorrectly, causing the failing test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not comparing the block items correctly. It is using the `equals` method for the axes and the blocks, which does not account for the correct comparison of the values in the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the values within the blocks instead of simply comparing the blocks themselves.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
