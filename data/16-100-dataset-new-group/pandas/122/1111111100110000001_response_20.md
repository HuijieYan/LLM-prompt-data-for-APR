The buggy function `equals` tries to compare two DataFrames `self` and `other` by calling the private method `_consolidate_inplace()`, sorting the blocks and then checking if the blocks are equal. The buggy function uses the `equals` method on the block to compare the two blocks, and this is where the bug occurs. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` is expected to fail, but it instead returns `True`. This is due to the incorrect implementation of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to correctly compare the DataFrames and return the expected result.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.blocks._values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version keeps the logic of comparing the axes and consolidating the blocks, but there are additional modifications to how the `canonicalize` function and sorting are performed. Additionally, the comparison between blocks is now correct, which ensures that the comparison between the two DataFrames will return the expected result.
