The buggy function `equals` seems to have an issue with comparing DataFrame objects. In the provided failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, the `equals` method returns `False` which is the expected output. However, due to a bug in the `equals` function, it incorrectly returns `True` in some cases.

The cause of the bug lies in the `equals` function's comparison logic with the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function incorrectly compares the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which leads to a false positive when blocks have identical values but different locations.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization of blocks needs to be revised to ensure that blocks with identical values but different locations are not considered equal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks based on values and locations
    return all(
        (block.values == oblock.values).all() and (block.mgr_locs.as_array == oblock.mgr_locs.as_array).all()
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now accurately compare the blocks of DataFrame objects, ensuring that it returns the correct result for the failing test and any similar cases. This fix addresses the issue posted on GitHub related to DataFrame `equals` wrongly returning `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
