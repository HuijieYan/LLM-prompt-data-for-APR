The bug appears to be in the canonicalize function's block argument. The function is attempting to access the dtype and mgr_locs attributes of the block. However, the block is not instantiated with these attributes, which is causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the block object has all the required attributes before accessing them in the canonicalize function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # check equality for each block
    for idx in range(len(self.blocks)):
        self_block = self.blocks[idx]
        other_block = other.blocks[idx]
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through the blocks of self and other, and check for equality in each block. If any block is not equal, we return False. If all blocks are equal, we return True. This approach ensures that we are comparing the actual data in the blocks rather than attempting to access attributes that might not be present in a given block.
