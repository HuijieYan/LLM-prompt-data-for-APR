The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when the two DataFrames have columns with different data types. When sorting the blocks by type name and manager locations, the function does not consider the data type of the columns. This leads to a false positive when comparing the two DataFrames for equality.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the data type of the blocks. Additionally, we can add a check to compare the data types of the columns before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    if set(self.blocks.get_block_type_counts()) != set(other.blocks.get_block_type_counts()):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.dtype == oblock.dtype for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
