The bug in the provided function is caused by the comparison of blocks between two BlockManager objects. The function attempts to compare the blocks without ensuring that they are in a consistent order, which leads to incorrect results.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to sort the blocks of both BlockManager objects before comparing them. This can be done by creating a sorting key for the blocks based on their data type and the locations within the BlockManager.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a sorting key function for the blocks
    def block_sort_key(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_sort_key)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should properly compare the blocks within the BlockManager objects and return the correct result.

This correction is made with the assumption that the `Block` class has an `equals` method to compare two blocks. If such a method does not exist, it would need to be added for this correction to work as intended. Additionally, the `as_array` method being used for `mgr_locs` is assumed to return an array.

After making this correction, the failing test should pass, and the error message should be resolved.
