The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The function aims to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.

Upon analysis, the potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:

1. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the class and once outside the class. This can cause confusion and lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The `canonicalize` function is called without the `self` parameter, but it is defined with a single parameter `block`. This mismatch can cause a runtime error.
3. The comparison of `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` may not result in the desired comparison of block types and manager locations.

The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is related to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. This can lead to inconsistent sorting and unequal comparisons due to the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to ensure that the `canonicalize` function is properly defined and called, and that the comparison of block types and manager locations is correctly implemented.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is appropriately defined within the `equals` method, and it compares the type of the block and the manager locations to ensure consistent and valid sorting. Additionally, the redundant definition of `canonicalize` outside the class has been removed.
