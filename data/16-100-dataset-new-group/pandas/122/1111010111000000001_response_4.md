The buggy function `equals` is defined in the class `BlockManager` in the file `managers.py` under the `pandas/core/internals` directory. This function is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The `equals` function first checks if the number of axes in both instances is equal. Then it checks if the labels of the axes are the same. If not, it returns `False`. After that, it consolidates the data for both instances and compares the blocks in the instances using a canonicalized order.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2`. These dataframes have different types for the columns 'a' and 'b', so the expected outcome is for `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`. The test is failing because the `equals` function is not correctly identifying that the dataframes are not equal due to the difference in column types.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of dataframes with different column types. To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the data type and values of each column within the dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare each block in the dataframes
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
        # Compare the values and the datatype of each column
        for b, ob in zip(block.values, oblock.values):
            if not (b == ob).all():
                return False
            if b.dtype != ob.dtype:
                return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we first compare the blocks using the existing logic. Then, we compare the values and datatypes of each column within the blocks. If any difference is found, we return `False`. Otherwise, we return `True` at the end.

This corrected version of the `equals` function will address the bug and should pass the failing test.
