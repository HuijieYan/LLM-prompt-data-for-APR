The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is contrary to the expected behavior, leading to the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of the blocks between two DataFrames. When comparing blocks, it fails to take into account the block locations and thus yields incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations. Then, when sorting the blocks, we should use the modified `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type name and the block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function to address the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs to account for different block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values, and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
