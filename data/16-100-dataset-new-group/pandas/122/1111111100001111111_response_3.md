## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks inplace to avoid issues with identical blocks in different locations
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare the blocks and their data to see if they are equal
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if (block1.shape != block2.shape) or (block1.dtype != block2.dtype):
            return False
        data1 = block1.values
        data2 = block2.values
        if not np.array_equal(data1, data2):
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Explanation
The bug in the original `equals` function stems from the fact that it fails to compare identical blocks with different locations, resulting in incorrect output. To fix this bug, the corrected version of the function includes the following changes:

1. Consolidate the blocks in place for both `self` and `other` BlockManager objects to avoid issues with identical blocks in different locations.
2. Use a loop to compare each block and their data for equality, verifying the shape and dtype and comparing the actual values using NumPy's `np.array_equal` function.

This strategy ensures that all blocks in both BlockManagers are directly compared, including their contents, to accurately determine equality.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `equals` function will now accurately determine if two BlockManager objects are equal, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
