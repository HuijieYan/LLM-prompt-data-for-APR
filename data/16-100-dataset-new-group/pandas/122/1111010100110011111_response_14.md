### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the block data within DataFrames. As a result, it is returning `True` instead of `False` when two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are compared using the `equals` method.

The specific error message from the failing test indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that should be considered not equal.

The expected input values for the buggy function `equals` are the two DataFrames to be compared, `self` and `other`. The expected output value should be a boolean indicating whether the DataFrames are equal.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the logic used to compare the axes and blocks of the two DataFrames.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the comparison logic within the `equals` function not properly handling cases where the block locations are different but the content of the blocks is identical. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` for DataFrames that should be considered not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to properly handle cases where blocks have different locations but identical content. This can be achieved by adjusting the comparison logic for the block data.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.shape, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function for block comparison takes into account the shape, dtype, and location of the block data. This ensures that blocks with different locations but identical content will still be correctly compared.
