To fix the bug in the equals function, we need to ensure that it returns False when comparing two dataframes with identical blocks but different locations. The issue on GitHub confirms that the equals function is returning True incorrectly in such cases.

The bug is likely occurring in the comparison of blocks within the equals function, as the error message indicates that the function is returning True when it should be returning False.

To address the bug, we should modify the canonicalize function used for sorting the blocks to include the location information of the blocks. This will ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are not considered equal.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs and block data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the equals function will compare the data, data block types, and block locations, ensuring that even if the blocks have identical data, if they are located differently, the function will correctly return False.

This corrected version of the equals function should satisfy the failing test case and produce the expected output.
