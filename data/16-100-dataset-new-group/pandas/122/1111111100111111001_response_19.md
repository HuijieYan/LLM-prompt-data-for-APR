The bug in the `equals` function lies in the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function before performing the equality check. The `canonicalize` function should not be declared within the `equals` function as it is already declared outside the function in the `BlockManager` class.

To fix the bug, we should remove the redefinition of `canonicalize` within the `equals` function, and also add the `self.` prefix when calling the `_consolidate_inplace` function for both `self` and `other` instances.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()  # Add self. prefix
    other._consolidate_inplace()  # Add other. prefix
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Remove the redefinition of `canonicalize` here

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=BlockManager.canonicalize)  # Use the canonicalize method defined in the BlockManager class
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=BlockManager.canonicalize)  # Use the canonicalize method defined in the BlockManager class
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the `self` and `other` instances of the `BlockManager` class and return the expected result.

This corrected version should resolve the failing test case with the provided error message.
