The bug in the code is causing the `equals` function to provide incorrect output. The `equals` function is intended to compare two BlockManager objects, checking if they are equal. However, it fails to do so, leading to incorrect results when the test is run. The `equals` function compares the axes of two BlockManager objects, then attempts to consolidate them in place and compare the blocks to determine if they are equal. This process seems to be flawed, as evidenced by the failing test case.

Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we can see that the logic for comparing the BlockManager objects is incorrect. It goes through a comparison process of axes, consolidation, and block ordering. It should resolve correctly, but there's a bug in the sorting logic.

It's clear that the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should return `False` since the data frames are not equal. However, due to the incorrect comparison in the `equals` function, the test returns `True`, signifying that the two DataFrames are considered equal when they are not.

To fix the bug, the sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` needs to be adjusted so that it correctly identifies the equality or inequality of the compared BlockManager objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name)
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to capture and sort the block using a tuple that combines `mgr_locs` and `dtype.name`. This modification will allow the function to correctly identify the equality or inequality of the compared BlockManager objects.
