The bug in the `equals` function is that it incorrectly returns True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This can be observed from the error message and the failing test case, where `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because it returns True instead of False. The issue reported on GitHub confirms this behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not properly comparing the blocks of the DataFrames. It is not considering the order of the blocks, which leads to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison takes into account the order and locations of the blocks. We can achieve this by modifying the way the blocks are compared.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if the blocks are equal
    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        other_block = other.blocks[i]
        if not block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we loop through each block in `self.blocks` and compare it with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. If any pair of blocks are not equal, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True at the end.

With this correction, the `equals` function will properly compare the blocks of the DataFrames, taking into account their order and locations. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
