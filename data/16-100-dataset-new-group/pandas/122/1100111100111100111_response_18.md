The bug in the `equals` method seems to be related to the way it sorts and compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`. Let's break down the main issues in the existing code based on the provided information:

1. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the `BlockManager` class and once inside it. This can lead to confusion and potential errors.
2. The sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is done using the `canonicalize` function, which could be causing the issue.
3. The assertion error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it is expected to return `False`, which suggests that the comparison logic inside the function is flawed.

To fix the bug, we can take the following steps:
1. Remove the redundant `canonicalize` function from inside the `BlockManager` class to avoid confusion.
2. Review and update the sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to ensure that the comparison is based on the correct criteria.
3. Ensure that the comparison logic inside the `equals` method is implemented correctly to validate whether the two `BlockManager` instances are truly equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs))
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version:
1. We have removed the redundant `canonicalize` function.
2. We updated the sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to compare based on `block.values` and `block.mgr_locs`.
3. We maintained the comparison logic to ensure that the `equals` method correctly checks for equality between the `BlockManager` instances.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
