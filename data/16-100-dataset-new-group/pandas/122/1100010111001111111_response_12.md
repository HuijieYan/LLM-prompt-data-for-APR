The bug in the equals function causes it to incorrectly return True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, leading to failing test cases.

The buggy function fails to correctly compare the locations of blocks when determining DataFrame equality. As a result, it returns True when it should return False for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to also consider block locations when sorting the blocks, ensuring that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the equals function will correctly compare the locations of blocks in addition to the block type and values, ensuring that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
