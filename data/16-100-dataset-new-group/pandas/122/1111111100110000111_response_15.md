The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not working as expected. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects, but it is returning `True` instead of `False` when the two objects are not equal due to identical blocks with different locations. 

The cause of the bug is in the `equals` function. It compares the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, and then sorts them based on a canonicalize function. However, the canonicalize function is not designed to consider identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect comparison results. The error message and the GitHub issue both confirm that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

To fix this bug, the canonicalize function needs to be updated to take into account the blocks' locations as well. This will ensure that the comparison between the blocks considers all relevant attributes to determine equality accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, dtype, and mgr_locs to ensure identical blocks with
    # different locations are not considered equal
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name, 
            block.dtype, 
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the updated `canonicalize` function, the `equals` function will now compare blocks based on their type name, dtype, and locations, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result when comparing `BlockManager` objects.
