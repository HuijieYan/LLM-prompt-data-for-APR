The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is causing the assertion error.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison between `block` and `oblock` within the `canonicalize` function.
2. The comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `all` function.

The bug is caused by the comparison between the blocks within the `canonicalize` function. It seems that the comparison logic inside the `canonicalize` function is not correctly identifying the equality of the blocks.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve correcting the `canonicalize` function to properly compare the block elements and then ensuring that the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `all` function is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values, block._mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now compares the `_values` attribute of the blocks, which should accurately determine their equality. Additionally, the `all` function compares the blocks using the `equals` method. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
