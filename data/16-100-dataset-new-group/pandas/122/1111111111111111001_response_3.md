The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by an issue with sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. Specifically, the `canonicalize` function does not correctly produce unique representations for each block to be used in sorting. As a result, the sorting process does not produce the expected output.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to generate unique representations for each block, allowing for correct sorting.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = [(block.shape, block.get_values()) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.shape, block.get_values()) for block in other.blocks]
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks)
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected version uses the `shape` and `get_values` methods to extract unique representations for each block before sorting and comparing them. This approach ensures that the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is done correctly, addressing the bug identified in the failing test case.
