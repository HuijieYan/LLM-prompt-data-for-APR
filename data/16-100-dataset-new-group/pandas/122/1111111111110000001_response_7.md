The buggy function, `equals`, is located in the `BlockManager` class within the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function calls the `canonicalize` function within the same class, as well as the `_consolidate_inplace` function.

The failing test, `test_dataframe_not_equal`, compares the equality of two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method. The test expects the result to be `False`, indicating that the DataFrames are not equal. However, the test fails with an assertion error, indicating that the result is `True` instead.

The error message shows that the actual result is `True`, and it provides a representation of the two DataFrames being compared.

The bug occurs because the `equals` function is not properly comparing the two DataFrames. This could be due to the `canonicalize` function not correctly ordering the blocks for comparison, or the `_consolidate_inplace` calls not being effective.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be adjusted to ensure that the block ordering is accurate for comparison. Additionally, the `_consolidate_inplace` calls might need to be revisited to ensure that any necessary data consolidation is performed before the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_numpy().tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function uses `mgr_locs.to_numpy().tolist()` to accurately represent the block locations. Additionally, the `_consolidate_inplace` calls remain unchanged.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now provide the expected result when comparing DataFrames, and the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test should pass successfully.
