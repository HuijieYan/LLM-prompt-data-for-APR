The buggy function is comparing two BlockManager objects to check if they are equal. It first compares the axes of the two objects and then checks if the blocks are equal by sorting and comparing them.

The bug in the function occurs when it calls the `_consolidate_inplace()` method on both `self` and `other` objects. This method may modify the internal state of the BlockManager objects, leading to unexpected behavior when comparing the blocks later on.

To fix the bug, the `_consolidate_inplace()` method calls should be removed from the `equals` function, as it introduces unnecessary side effects that may impact the comparison of blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the calls to `_consolidate_inplace()` have been removed. The comparison of the BlockManager objects and their blocks should now work as intended without interference from unnecessary method calls.
