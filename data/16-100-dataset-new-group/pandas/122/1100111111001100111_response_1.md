The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return True when the expected output is False. The issue is present because the function is wrongly sorting the blocks based on their type and location, leading to an incorrect comparison. 

To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the sorting of the blocks based on their type and location. Additionally, provide the correct implementation of the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the `equals` function should correctly compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
