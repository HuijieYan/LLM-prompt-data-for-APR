### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not be accurate.
2. The comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may not be accurate.
3. The use of the `canonicalize` function to sort and compare the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` may not be working as expected.

### Cause of the bug
The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. This causes it to return incorrect results, leading to the failing test. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` is triggered, which implies that the `df1.equals(df2)` call is returning `True` instead of `False`.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables, it's clear that the comparison of axes and blocks is not functioning as expected, leading to incorrect results.

Based on the GitHub issue, this bug is causing the `equals` method to return `True` when it's expected to return `False`.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Compare the axes of `self` and `other` more accurately, possibly by comparing the labels directly.
2. Check the length and structure of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to ensure accurate comparison.
3. Verify the sorting and comparison process using the `canonicalize` function for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to identify if it's causing the incorrect results.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    # Ensure labels are equal
    if any(a1 != a2 for a1, a2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    # Ensure blocks are equal
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the labels of the axes and the equality of the blocks, ensuring a more accurate comparison. This should address the issue and make the `equals` method return the correct results, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
