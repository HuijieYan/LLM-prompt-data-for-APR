The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The purpose of this method is to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison logic regarding self.axes and other.axes.
2. Use of methods like `_consolidate_inplace` and `canonicalize` which may not be functioning as intended.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not properly comparing the two `BlockManager` objects. This is evident from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and the error message, which indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic in the `equals` method is correct and that any supporting methods such as `_consolidate_inplace` and `canonicalize` are functioning as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = self.axes
    other_axes = other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
            
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now pass the failing test.
