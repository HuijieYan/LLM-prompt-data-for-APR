The bug in the provided function `equals` is likely due to the inconsistent handling of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. 

After analyzing the function, it appears that the function uses a `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks by data type and location, and then compares the sorted blocks. However, it seems that there is an issue with the canonicalization logic, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function returns consistent and comparable values for blocks. This may involve considering additional attributes of the blocks or modifying the way the blocks are sorted.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, the `canonicalize` function now uses the block's class name and `mgr_locs` for sorting. This should provide consistent and meaningful values for the blocks to be compared correctly. With this change, the function should now produce correct comparison results and pass the failing test.
