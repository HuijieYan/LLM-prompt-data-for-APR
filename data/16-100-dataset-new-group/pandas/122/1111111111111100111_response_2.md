The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`, as demonstrated by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. After analyzing the runtime input/output values, we can see that the issue arises when comparing the `blocks` attribute of the two `BlockManager` instances. The `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks is incorrectly handling the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks, leading to the unexpected comparison results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks. Additionally, we should remove the redundant declaration of the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class, as it is already defined above the `equals` function.

A corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

The corrected `equals` function now properly handles the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which takes into account the `dtype` name and `mgr_locs`. With this fix, the function should now return the correct result when compared with the failing test.
