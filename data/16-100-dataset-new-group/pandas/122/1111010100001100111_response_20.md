Based on the provided information and the GitHub issue, it appears that the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is returning incorrect results when comparing blocks with different locations. The issue was reported when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, where the expected output was False, but the method returned True.

The problem in the existing `equals` function is that it does not consider the block locations when comparing the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `equals` method to consider the block locations when comparing blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.mgr_locs, block)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, we modify the `canonicalize` function to use the block's `mgr_locs` for comparison. This ensures that the block locations are taken into account when comparing the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. With this modification, the `equals` method should now correctly handle comparisons of identical blocks with different locations.
