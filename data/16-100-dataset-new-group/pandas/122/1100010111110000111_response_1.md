Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False

    self_values = self.values
    other_values = other.values

    if self_values.shape != other_values.shape:
        return False

    return not np.all(self_values == other_values)
```
In the buggy function, the `equals` method is comparing `DataFrame` objects using attributes like `self.axes` and `self.blocks`, which are not robust and efficient for comparing data. Instead, we can directly compare the `values` of the DataFrames after checking if they have the same shape.

The corrected version uses the `numpy` library to directly compare the values of the DataFrames, ensuring that any discrepancies in the values will be accurately captured.

This revised implementation should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and make the `equals` method more reliable and efficient for comparing DataFrames.
