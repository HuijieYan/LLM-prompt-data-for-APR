The issue with the current `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other`. The sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function is causing the function to return `True` incorrectly. The `canonicalize` function is sorting blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs, which might not be consistent for different dataframes.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for comparing blocks in the `equals` function. We can compare the blocks based on their actual values instead of sorting them using the `canonicalize` function which is prone to inconsistency.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block in self.blocks:
        if block not in other.blocks:
            return False

    return True
```

This modification compares each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks` directly, without requiring sorting based on dtype and mgr_locs. This should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function work as expected.

After making this change, the `equals` function should now return `False` as expected for the failing test case provided.
