### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to comparing blocks in different locations but with the same values. The function tries to compare the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on their canonicalized order, but it does not take into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the comparison strategy to handle the case where identical blocks might have different locations. We can modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks using a different method that takes into account block location as well.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Use a different comparison method to handle identical blocks with different locations
    return all(
        block.equals(other.get_block(block.mgr_locs)) for block in self.blocks
    )
```
In the corrected version, we use the `get_block` method on the `other` BlockManager to retrieve the block based on the location `mgr_locs` from `self.blocks`, and then compare the blocks using the `equals` method. This way, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly handled in the comparison.
