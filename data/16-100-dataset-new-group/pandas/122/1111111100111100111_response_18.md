## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. The issue on GitHub suggests that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it is returning `True` instead. This indicates that the comparison logic within the `equals` function is incorrect. The comparison of blocks and their order seems to be the problem. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the logic for comparing the blocks within the `equals` function is correct. We also need to confirm that the order of the blocks is being handled properly during the comparison.

We can address this by reviewing and revising the logic within the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks and their order, ensuring that the function returns the expected boolean value.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the sorted blocks
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we maintain the initial checks for axes and blocks, then proceed to sort and compare the blocks to ensure that the function returns the correct boolean value. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
