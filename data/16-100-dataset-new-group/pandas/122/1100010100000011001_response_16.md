The bug in the provided function is likely due to an issue with comparing the blocks of the self and other objects. The function is not properly comparing the dtype name and block manager locations to check for equality. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalize function correctly generates a tuple combining the dtype name and mgr_locs. Additionally, we should check that each block in self.blocks is equal to the corresponding block in other.blocks using the canonicalized order.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function now generates a tuple by converting the dtype and mgr_locs to strings to ensure a consistent comparison. This should fix the bug in the original function.
