The bug in the equals method seems to be related to the comparison of two BlockManager objects. It looks like the comparison relies on the sorting order of the blocks, which might not be consistent between the two BlockManager objects. This can cause the equals method to return incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can modify the equals method to first check if the axes of the two BlockManager objects are equal, and then compare the blocks directly based on their labels.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.axes != other.axes:
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for label, s_block in self_blocks.items():
        o_block = other_blocks.get(label)
        
        if o_block is None or not s_block.equals(o_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This implementation first checks if the axes of the two BlockManager objects are equal, and then iterates over the blocks of the self BlockManager, comparing them to the corresponding blocks in the other BlockManager. If any of the blocks are not equal, the method returns False, indicating that the BlockManager objects are not equal. If all blocks are equal, the method returns True.

This should address the issue with comparing BlockManager objects and resolve the failing test case.
