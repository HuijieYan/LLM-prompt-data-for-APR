### Analysis
The `equals` function is buggy as it is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is leading to a failing test case, as shown in the error message. The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances and returns `True` if they are equal, but it is not accounting for the case where the blocks are identical but have different locations.

The function compares the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances `self` and `other`. It then sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization logic and checks if each block is equal in the sorted order. The bug occurs because the canonicalization logic does not consider the locations of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks. This function only considers the block's dtype name and manager locations (`mgr_locs`), but it should also consider the actual data within the block.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be updated to consider the data within the block in addition to the dtype name and manager locations. This will ensure that the comparison of blocks is done based on their actual content, not just their type and location.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block's values along with its dtype name and manager locations. This ensures that blocks are sorted and compared based on their actual content, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
