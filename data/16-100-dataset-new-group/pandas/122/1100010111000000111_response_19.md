## The corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.to_bytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is due to the comparison of block dtype names when canonicalizing the block for sorting. The dtype.name was used in the canonicalize function, but this approach fails when dealing with different data types. This caused the equals function to return True incorrectly for dataframes with identical blocks but different data types.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the canonicalize function to use the block dtype and mgr_locs when sorting and comparing blocks, rather than just the dtype name. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

The corrected version of the function should use block.dtype and block.mgr_locs.as_array to_bytes() when sorting the blocks, and then compare the sorted blocks using the equals() method.

The corrected version of the function has been provided above.
