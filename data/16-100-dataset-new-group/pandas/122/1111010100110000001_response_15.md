The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The purpose of the `equals` method is to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class and check if they are equal. 

The potential error locations within the `equals` method are:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` to check if they have the same length but not comparing their contents.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function which may not be returning the correct result for comparing blocks.
3. The final comparison of individual blocks using the `equals` method, which may not be working as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not properly comparing the internal axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. This leads to the method returning incorrect results in some cases, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, a proper comparison of the contents of `self_axes` and `other_axes` should be performed, and the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should be revisited to ensure it correctly orders the blocks for comparison. Additionally, the comparison of individual blocks should be reviewed to ensure the `equals` method is being used correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` is improved to also check the contents of the axes. The `canonicalize` function is modified to properly combine the type name and `mgr_locs`, and `block.dtype.name` is replaced with `block.dtype` to ensure the comparison is reliable. Finally, the comparison of individual blocks now uses the `equals` method correctly.
