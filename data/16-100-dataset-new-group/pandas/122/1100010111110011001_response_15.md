The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to how it compares two DataFrames. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two DataFrames with different values but the same shape are not equal.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, with the found value being `True`. This suggests that the `equals` function returns `True` when it should be `False`.

One potential cause of the bug is the comparison of the data blocks in the `equals` function. If the data blocks are sorted and compared incorrectly, it could lead to the wrong result.

To fix the bug, the sorting and comparison of data blocks in the function should be revised to correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # comparison of data blocks, sorted by index
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the comparison of data blocks uses the `values` attribute of each block to ensure that the values within the blocks are directly compared, rather than relying on the `equals` method. This should result in the correct comparison of the DataFrames and pass the failing test case.
