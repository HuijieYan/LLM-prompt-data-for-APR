The buggy function is the "equals" method within the BlockManager class. The purpose of this method is to compare two BlockManager objects for equality.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the lengths of self_axes and other_axes without validating the validity of the axes.
2. The comparison of the lengths of self.blocks and other.blocks without validating the validity of the blocks.
3. The sorting of self.blocks and other.blocks without a proper canonicalization function.

The cause of the bug is related to the comparison of axes and blocks between two BlockManager objects. The comparison is not done in a robust and validated manner, and the sorting of blocks is done without proper canonicalization.

To fix the bug:
1. Validate the axes and blocks of the BlockManager objects before comparing their lengths.
2. Implement a canonicalization function for sorting the blocks to ensure a valid comparison.
3. Use a more robust method for comparing the axes and blocks for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().__array__().tolist(), block.dtype)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the "other" object is an instance of BlockManager. Then, we compare the axes for equality and validate each block using a canonicalization function before sorting and comparing them.
