The problem seems to be with the comparison between the dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the DataFrame axes using the `equals` method.
2. The comparison between individual blocks within the DataFrames using the `equals` method.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not handling the DataFrame columns correctly. When the data types of columns are different, the canonicalization does not work as expected, leading to the wrong result when comparing the DataFrames using the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be updated to consider the column data types in addition to the dtype name and mgr_locs. This will ensure that the comparison between DataFrames is done correctly, taking into account the data type differences.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding `block.values` to the tuple returned by the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison between DataFrames takes into account the data types of the columns, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
