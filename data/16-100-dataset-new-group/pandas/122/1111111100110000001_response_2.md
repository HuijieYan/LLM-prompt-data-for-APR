The bug in the provided function `equals` is that it is not correctly comparing the DataFrame objects `self` and `other`. When comparing the values of `df1` and `df2`, the result is True when it should be False.

The error message indicates that the comparison `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because it is evaluating to True.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of the DataFrames. There is a problem with the way it is comparing the blocks within the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to be corrected to properly compare the blocks of the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_numeric_data().values
    other_blocks = other.get_numeric_data().values

    return np.array_equal(self_blocks, other_blocks)
```

In this corrected version, the comparison logic is modified to access the numeric values of the DataFrames using the `get_numeric_data().values` method. Then, the `np.array_equal` method from the numpy library is used to compare the blocks. This approach ensures that the comparison is done correctly on the numeric values of the DataFrames.

With this corrected `equals` function, the comparison `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` should now pass as expected.
