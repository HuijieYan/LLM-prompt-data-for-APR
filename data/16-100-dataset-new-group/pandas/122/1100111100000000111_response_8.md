## Analysis:
The buggy `equals` function compares `DataFrame` objects for equality. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that `df3.equals(df4)` wrongly returns `True` when it should return `False`. The issue highlights that the problem occurs when the DataFrame has identical blocks with different locations.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Block comparison logic may be flawed.
2. Sorting logic for blocks may be incorrect.
3. Use of internal methods like `_consolidate_inplace` might have side effects.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function, potentially due to the use of a flawed comparison logic and incorrect sorting. The issue of identical blocks with different locations could lead to a logic flaw in the comparison process.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Refactor the block comparison logic to correctly handle identical blocks with different locations.
2. Adjust the sorting logic to handle unconsolidated blocks (e.g., Categorical) to ensure proper recognition of their uniqueness.
3. Validate the use of internal methods like `_consolidate_inplace` for any side effects on the comparison process.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # The issue of identical blocks with different locations is addressed by sorting the blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return len(self.blocks) == len(other.blocks) and all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison logic is improved by sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are properly handled during the comparison process. Additionally, the comparison for the length of the blocks is placed before the block comparison loop to avoid any unnecessary iterations if the lengths do not match.
