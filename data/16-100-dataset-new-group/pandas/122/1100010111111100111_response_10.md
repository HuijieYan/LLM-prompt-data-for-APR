The buggy function `equals` in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is not correctly comparing two DataFrames and is returning a false positive. This can be identified by analyzing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` and the corresponding error message. The error message shows that the function incorrectly returns True when it should be False. This leads to a test failure.

The bug in the `equals` function is related to the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. It incorrectly sorts and compares the blocks, leading to a false positive result.

The bug results from the function failing to correctly compare and sort the blocks within the DataFrames. This can be seen from the runtime input/output variable values. The sorting and comparison logic for the blocks may be incorrect.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to update the `canonicalize` function to correctly sort and compare the blocks within the DataFrames. This may involve comparing the contents of each block in a more accurate manner.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to consider the type of block, its locations, and its values when sorting and comparing. This should ensure a more accurate comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames and resolve the false positive result.
