The bug in the `equals` function seems to stem from the improper sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists before comparison. This might be causing the failing test as the sorting could be affecting the order in which the blocks are compared.

To address this, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to accept both `self` and `other` parameters. Then, instead of using two separate sorted lists for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, we can combine the blocks of both `self` and `other` into a single list and then sort that list.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the return value of the `canonicalize` function uses the proper methods to retrieve the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` values from the block objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # combine blocks from self and other
    combined_blocks = [(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)]

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(self, other, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    # sort the combined blocks list based on canonicalize function
    combined_blocks = sorted(combined_blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(self, other, x[0]))

    # compare sorted blocks
    for block, oblock in combined_blocks:
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With these changes, the corrected function should now properly compare the blocks from `self` and `other` in a consistent manner and return the expected results for the failing test.
