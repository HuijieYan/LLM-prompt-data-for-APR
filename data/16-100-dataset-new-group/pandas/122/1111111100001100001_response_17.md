The bug in the equals function is that the canonicalize function is defined twice within the BlockManager class. This causes the canonicalize function from the class to be shadowed by the other canonicalize function which is not a method of the class. Therefore, when the equals function is called, it ends up using the wrong canonicalize function which leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the duplicate canonicalize function from the BlockManager class and ensure that the equals function uses the correct canonicalize function.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the equals function should now properly use the canonicalize function defined within the BlockManager class, resolving the bug.
