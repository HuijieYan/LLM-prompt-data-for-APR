## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue is likely related to the sorting of blocks in the `canonicalize` function, which causes blocks with different locations to be considered equal.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function in a way that preserves the block locations if they are different, as well as ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account the block locations.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function uses `tuple(block.mgr_locs)` to preserve the block locations during sorting. This ensures that blocks with different locations are not considered equal. The comparison of blocks now takes into account their locations, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
