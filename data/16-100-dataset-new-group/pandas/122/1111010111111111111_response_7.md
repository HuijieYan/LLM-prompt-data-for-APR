The bug in the `equals` function appears to stem from the comparison of axis labels in different orders, and the sorting of blocks for comparison. This leads to incorrect comparison results and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

To fix the bug, we can sort the axes labels before performing the comparison and sorting the blocks. This way, we ensure that the comparison is consistent and accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        # Sort the axes labels
        self_axes_sorted = sorted(self_axes)
        other_axes_sorted = sorted(other_axes)
        if len(self_axes_sorted) != len(other_axes_sorted):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes_sorted, other_axes_sorted)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        # Sort the blocks before comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this fix, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected comparison results based on the input data and block sorting. This should also address the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".
