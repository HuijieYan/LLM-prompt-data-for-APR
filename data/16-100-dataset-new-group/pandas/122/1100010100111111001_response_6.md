One potential issue within the buggy function is the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. It is possible that the sorting may not accurately represent the equivalence of the blocks, leading to a false negative result when checking for equality between the two `BlockManager` instances.

The cause of the bug could be that the sorting order based on `canonicalize` does not properly capture the equivalence of the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances, leading to a false negative result in the equality check.

To fix the bug, we can modify the sorting logic to better capture the equivalence of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a combination of block data and types
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.values)
    
    # sort the blocks based on canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now creates a tuple consisting of the block's type and its values. This combination better captures the equivalence of the blocks. Sorting the blocks based on this new `canonicalize` function ensures that the comparison accurately reflects the equivalence of the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances.
