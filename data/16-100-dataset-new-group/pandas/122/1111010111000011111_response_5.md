The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is causing the function to return True incorrectly. The bug is reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The bug in the `equals` function seems to be with the logic for comparing the blocks in the DataFrames. It is not taking into account the possibility for the same blocks with different locations.

A potential strategy for fixing this bug would be to modify the logic for comparing blocks in the `equals` function to correctly handle the case of identical blocks with different locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified logic for comparing blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly handle the case of identical blocks with different locations and return the expected result for the failing test case.
