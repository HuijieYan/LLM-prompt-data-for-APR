The bug in the provided function is that it calls a local function `canonicalize` but also has a global function with the same name, which can lead to ambiguity. Since the global `canonicalize` function is not being called from inside the `BlockManager` class, we can remove it. 

Here is the corrected version of the function after removing the duplicate `canonicalize` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes.tolist(), other.axes.tolist()
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
With this correction, the function should now work as expected and meet the provided input/output values.
