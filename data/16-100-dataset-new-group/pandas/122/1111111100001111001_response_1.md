The bug in the `equals` function seems to stem from the way it compares blocks from two `BlockManager` objects. It first checks if the lengths of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` attributes are the same, and then proceeds to compare individual axes using the `equals` method. It then consolidates the structures in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method before comparing the lengths of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes.

The bug occurs in the comparison of the blocks. It tries to canonicalize the block order by using a sorting function that compares the dtype name and the manager locations. However, `block` is referred to, but not defined, in the function. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function should be defined outside the `equals` function because it is already defined as a method of the `BlockManager` class.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `canonicalize` function outside of the `equals` function and utilize it to sort the blocks for comparison. Also, ensure that the variable `block` is accessible within the scope of the function by explicitly defining it.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class definitions)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By defining the `canonicalize` function outside the `equals` method and ensuring that the variable `block` is accessible within the function, we address the bug and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct comparison result for blocks in the `BlockManager` objects.
