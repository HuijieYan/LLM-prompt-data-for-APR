The bug in the buggy function `equals` is likely caused by the way it handles the comparison of two DataFrames. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is designed to check if two different DataFrames are incorrectly evaluated as equal by the `equals` function. The failing test provides the error message and there's a corresponding GitHub issue detailing the problem.

The bug is caused by the comparison of two DataFrames that have different values in the same cells and should not be considered equal. The function is failing to compare the contents of the DataFrames correctly.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare the values of the blocks in the DataFrames directly, ensuring that it checks for equality of the actual data rather than the block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self._data.blocks
    other_blocks = other._data.blocks

    return all(
        self_blocks.get(block_id, None) is not None and
        other_blocks.get(block_id, None) is not None and
        self_blocks[block_id].equals(other_blocks[block_id])
        for block_id in self_blocks
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks' contents in the DataFrames and also handles possible cases where a block is present in one DataFrame but not in the other.

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly evaluate whether two DataFrames are equal, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
