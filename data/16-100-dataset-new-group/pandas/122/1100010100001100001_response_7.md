The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison of the 'self.blocks' and 'other.blocks' variables. It appears that the function is comparing the blocks based on their order and type, but not actually checking for their content equality.

The strategy for fixing this bug would be to modify the 'canonicalize' function to compare the actual values of the blocks instead of just their type and order.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs 
    # because there might be unconsolidated blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished
    # by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return list(block.values)

    self_blocks = [canonicalize(block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [canonicalize(block) for block in other.blocks]
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In the corrected version, the 'canonicalize' function now compares the actual values of the blocks by converting them to lists and then comparing the lists. This allows for a more accurate comparison of the block contents for equality.
