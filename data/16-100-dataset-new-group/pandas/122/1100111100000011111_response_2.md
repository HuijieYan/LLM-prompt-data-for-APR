There are several potential errors in the buggy function. First, the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside of the BlockManager class and once within it. This can lead to confusion and potential errors when calling the function. Additionally, the comparison of block equality using `block.equals(oblock)` may not work as intended, especially if the blocks have different memory locations or other internal differences that are not directly observable.

The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function is returning True when it should be returning False in the case of identical blocks with different locations. This indicates that the function is not performing the block comparison accurately.

To resolve the issue, the comparison of blocks should be designed to take into account both the value equality and the location or memory equality of the blocks. It may be necessary to compare additional attributes or implement a custom comparison method for the block objects.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # define a custom comparison function for blocks
    def block_equals(block, oblock):
        return block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)  # compare location as well

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, a custom `block_equals` function is defined to compare the blocks by both their values and locations. This ensures that the equality comparison takes into account the potential issue of identical blocks with different locations.
