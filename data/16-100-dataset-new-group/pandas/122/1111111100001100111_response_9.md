Based on the information provided, it appears that the bug is caused by the way the `equals` function is checking for equality between blocks in the `BlockManager` class. It is incorrectly identifying identical blocks with different locations as not equal, leading to the incorrect return value.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks in a way that considers their content rather than their locations. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we sort the blocks based on the raw values of each block using `block.values.tostring()` rather than the `canonicalize` function. This approach ensures that the blocks are compared based on their content rather than their locations, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

By making this modification, the `equals` function should now correctly identify identical blocks with different locations as equal, and the test case provided in the GitHub issue should return the expected result of `False`.
