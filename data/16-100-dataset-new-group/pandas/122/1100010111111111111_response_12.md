The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is happening because the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks is not properly handling the case where the blocks have the same data but different locations.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block data in addition to the block type and locations, so that blocks with the same data but different locations are not considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type,
    # data, and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method will properly consider blocks with the same data but different locations as not equal, as expected. This change will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test case passes.
