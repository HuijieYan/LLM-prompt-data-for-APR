## The revised version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the original buggy function, the issue arises from the comparison between the 'dtype' attribute of the block and the 'mgr_locs' attribute. The 'dtype' attribute is not directly comparable, and the 'mgr_locs' attribute is also not correctly formatted to be compared. 

To fix the bug, the 'dtype' attribute should be converted to a string when creating the canonicalized representation of the block. Additionally, the 'mgr_locs' attribute should be used directly without converting it to a list, as it seems to be a custom object with its own comparison rules.

The revised function incorporates these changes, ensuring that the comparison is performed correctly and the function returns the expected boolean value for comparing two DataFrames.

The revised function should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
