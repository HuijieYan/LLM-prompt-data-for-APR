## Correction:

The reason for the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` is that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class does not handle the case where the blocks might have identical data but different locations. The current implementation only compares the blocks without considering their locations.

To fix this issue, we can modify the canonicalize function inside the `equals` method to include the block's data location information when sorting the blocks before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data location information from `mgr_locs`. We then use this modified `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks before comparing them.

This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the `equals` method handle the case of identical blocks with different locations properly.
