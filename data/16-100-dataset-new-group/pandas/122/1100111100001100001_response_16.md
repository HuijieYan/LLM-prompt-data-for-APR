The bug in the given function is likely to be related to the sorting of the blocks based on the canonicalize function. The canonicalize function returns a tuple, and sorting the blocks using this tuple might not be efficient for comparison.

To fix the bug, we can remove the canonicalize function and modify the sorting logic for the blocks. Instead of sorting and comparing the blocks based on the tuple returned by canonicalize, we can directly compare the blocks without sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting, we can avoid the potential bug caused by the sorting logic in the original function.
