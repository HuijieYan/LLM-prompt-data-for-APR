The buggy function `equals` is failing when comparing two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other` because it does not properly handle the comparison of the blocks within each `BlockManager`.

The bug arises from the fact that the function `canonicalize` is defined outside of the `equals` function, so when the `canonicalize` function is called from within the `equals` function, it is not picking up the method from the correct class, resulting in incorrect comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be defined within the `BlockManager` class. Additionally, it seems that the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs, this logic should be applied correctly to compare the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `equals` function should now pass the given failing test.
