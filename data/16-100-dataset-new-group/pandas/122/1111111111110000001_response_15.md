The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is used to compare two data blocks and determine if they are equal. The function fails to correctly compare and identify the inequality of two DataFrame objects, leading to a failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class does not correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames. It does not properly consider the values or the data types of the elements within the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function compares the values and data types of the elements in the two blocks. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the shapes of the blocks differ, and return `False` in those cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for index in range(len(self.blocks)):
        block1 = self.blocks[index]
        block2 = other.blocks[index]
        if not block1.shape == block2.shape:
            return False
        if not block1.dtypes.equals(block2.dtypes):
            return False
        if not block1.values.equals(block2.values):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through the blocks in both `self` and `other`, and checks for equality of shapes, data types, and values. If any of these checks fail, the function returns `False`, indicating that the blocks are not equal. If none of the checks fail, the function returns `True`, indicating that the blocks are equal.
