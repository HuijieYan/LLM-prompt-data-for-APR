To fix the bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, we need to modify the code to compare the contents of the DataFrames rather than comparing the blocks directly. The issue arises from a mismatch when comparing the blocks directly, resulting in the incorrect return value.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Compare the contents of the DataFrames instead of the blocks directly
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

Explanation:
1. I analyzed the provided code and the GitHub issue to understand the problem.
2. The cause of the bug is due to comparing the blocks directly, which results in an incorrect return value.
3. The corrected version compares the contents of the DataFrames using the `equals` method for the values.
4. By comparing the contents of the DataFrames, we ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the actual data in the DataFrames.
5. The corrected `equals` method now correctly compares the DataFrames and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
