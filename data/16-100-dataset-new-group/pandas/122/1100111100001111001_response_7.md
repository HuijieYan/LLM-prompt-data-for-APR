The bug in the given function is causing it to not return the expected value due to the sorting of blocks. Looking at the buggy function, it appears that the `canonicalize` function is not handling the `block` parameter correctly. It should take `self` as an instance method within the `BlockManager` class. 

The `canonicalize` function is expected to return a tuple combining the type name and the `mgr_locs` of the block, but it is not correctly accessing the block's properties. Additionally, there is a missing `self` parameter in the `canonicalize` definition.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be correctly defined within the `BlockManager` class and should be passed `self` to access the properties of the block. 

Here is the corrected version of the provided function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods)
    
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # corrected canonicalize function to retrieve properties of the block
        def canonicalize(self, block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(self, x))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(other, x))
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now correctly accesses the properties of the block using the `self` parameter. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected values.
