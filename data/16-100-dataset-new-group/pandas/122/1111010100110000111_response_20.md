The issue with the `equals` function seems to be with comparing DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations. The function is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be returning `False`.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the blocks in the DataFrames due to their different locations, resulting in a false positive comparison.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `equals` function to account for identical blocks with different locations. This may involve sorting the blocks based on certain properties before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    # The corrected equals function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Sort blocks by certain properties before comparison
        def get_block_key(block):
            return (block._consolidate_inplace().dtype.name, tuple(block.items()))

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_key)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_key)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should address the issue of returning `True` incorrectly for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
