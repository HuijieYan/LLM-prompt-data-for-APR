The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should return `False`. This is evident from the failing test and the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The issue is caused by the  `equals` function not comparing the dataframes correctly. The function does not account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to consider the location of blocks when comparing dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values.tolist(), block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values.tolist(), block.mgr_locs))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the dataframes, accounting for identical blocks with different locations, and pass the failing test as well as resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
