The bug in the given function `equals` is causing the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test to fail. The `equals` function is located within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`, and the failing test is in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the bug may be caused due to the improper comparison of DataFrames. The `equals` function should compare two DataFrames element-wise, but the buggy implementation is sorting the blocks based on the data type of each block, which is incorrect and causing the comparison to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function should be modified to compare the elements of the DataFrames directly, instead of sorting and comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        for (s_key, s_block), (o_key, o_block) in zip(self.blocks.items(), other.blocks.items()):
            if not s_block.values.equals(o_block.values):
                return False

        return True
```

In the corrected version, the function directly compares the values of the blocks in the DataFrames, instead of sorting and comparing blocks based on their data types. This should address the issue causing the failing test, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
