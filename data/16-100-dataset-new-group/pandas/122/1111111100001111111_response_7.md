The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that it incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is due to the incorrect canonicalization of block order using a tuple combining the type name and then `mgr_locs`. It causes the function to fail to correctly identify and compare blocks with different locations, leading to the wrong return value.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to include the block's locations in the tuple, so it correctly identifies and orders the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not wrongly identified as equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block's locations into the tuple for canonicalization, the corrected function will now correctly identify and compare blocks with different locations, resulting in the expected return value for the `equals` function.
