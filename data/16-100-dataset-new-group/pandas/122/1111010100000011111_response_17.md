## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The issue occurs when `equals` wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This leads to the wrong comparison result and causes unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle cases where blocks have identical data but different locations.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The buggy function is fixed below
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.data, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Check that each block being equal
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block._is_same_block(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```
