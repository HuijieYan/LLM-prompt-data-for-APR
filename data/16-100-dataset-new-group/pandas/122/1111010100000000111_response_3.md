Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function, it appears that the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly returning true in cases where identical blocks have different locations. This is likely due to the way the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks, as it only considers the block's data type and locations and does not account for other potentially different attributes.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional attributes of the blocks, such as shape or size, in order to distinguish between blocks with different locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, shape, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.shape, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, `canonicalize` now includes the block's shape along with its data type and locations. This will ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations will be correctly identified as not equal.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result for DataFrame comparisons.
