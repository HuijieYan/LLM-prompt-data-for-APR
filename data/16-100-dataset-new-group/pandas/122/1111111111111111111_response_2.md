The bug in the `equals` function appears to be related to the sorting and comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The issue seems to occur when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This results in the `equals` method wrongly returning `True` instead of `False`, as shown in the failing test.

The expression `df1.equals(df2)` is expected to evaluate to `False`, but it's incorrectly returning `True` based on the failing test provided.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the logic within the `equals` function to account for the block locations and ensure that the comparison reflects the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function based on the analysis:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.MAX, block.dtype.name, block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating a more comprehensive canonicalization approach that considers the block locations and types, the corrected function should appropriately handle the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

I would recommend testing this corrected version with the failing test case to ensure that it now returns the expected result of `False`. Once confirmed, it should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
