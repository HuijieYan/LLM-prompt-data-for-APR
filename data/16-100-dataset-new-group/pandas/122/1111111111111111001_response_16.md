The bug in the given function 'equals' of the 'BlockManager' class is causing it to fail when checking if two dataframes are equal. The issue is with the 'self.blocks' and 'other.blocks' tuples not being sorted correctly, causing the failing test to produce an error message.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the 'self.blocks' and 'other.blocks' are sorted in the same order before checking for equality. This will ensure that the comparison between the two dataframes is done correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
