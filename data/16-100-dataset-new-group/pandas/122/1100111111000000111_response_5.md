The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The issue is related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method, as indicated by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" provides some relevant context and examples of the problem.

The bug occurs when comparing two dataframes using the `equals` method, where it wrongly returns True if the blocks of the dataframes have identical values but are located at different positions.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison does not mistakenly return True for dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.__array_interface__["data"][0], )  # Using memory address

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
The corrected version of the `equals` method now uses the memory address of the underlying data represented by the blocks, as a more reliable indicator for comparison. This should resolve the issue of returning True for dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.
