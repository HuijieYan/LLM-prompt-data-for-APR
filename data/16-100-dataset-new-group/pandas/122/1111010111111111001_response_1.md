The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. The function fails the test because it does not compare the contents of the `BlockManager` objects correctly and produces incorrect output. The primary issue lies in the comparison of the `blocks` attribute, which does not handle elements in the `blocks` tuple appropriately.

The "equals" function's logic fails to handle the block comparison correctly, leading to the incorrect equality check for the two `BlockManager` instances. This results in the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix this bug, the logic in the "equals" function needs to be modified to correctly compare the `blocks` attribute. Sorting and comparison should be done explicitly for each block in the `BlockManager` instance, considering relevant attributes such as data type and block locations.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare each block in the BlockManager
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

The corrected "equals" function explicitly iterates through each block in both `BlockManager` instances and compares them individually. This ensures that the contents of the `blocks` attribute are correctly compared, addressing the issues present in the original buggy code. Upon using the corrected function with the provided failing test, the test should pass as the function will produce the expected output.
