The issue with the `equals` function is that it is incorrectly returning `True` for two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that contain the same data but in a different order. This is due to the comparison failing to account for the location of identical blocks within the DataFrames, leading to an incorrect result. 

The cause of the bug is in the `equals` function. It fails to consider the location of blocks in the comparison of two DataFrames. As a result, when comparing two DataFrames that contain the same data in different orders, the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`. 

To fix the bug, the function needs to consider the location of blocks in addition to their content when performing the comparison of DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(sorted(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The changes made in the corrected version of the function include using `tuple(sorted(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))` for canonicalizing block locations and sorting the blocks before comparison. This addresses the issue of failing to consider the block locations in the comparison and ensures that the function returns the correct result for comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.

With these corrections, the `equals` function should now return the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.
