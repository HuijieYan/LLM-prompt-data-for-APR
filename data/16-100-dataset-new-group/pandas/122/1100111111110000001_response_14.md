The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` in the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function. This is resulting in the AssertionError as the comparison of the two DataFrames is not returning the expected result.

The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is comparing the DataFrames correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
            return False

        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
            
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
After correcting the `equals` method and re-running the failing test, it should pass without any assertion errors.
