The bug in the function `equals` is causing it to return `True` when it should be returning `False` for identical blocks with different locations. This is resulting in a failing test with the error message: `assert True is False`. The expected output is `False` in this case.

The bug is likely in the `canonicalize` function where the `block` and `oblock` are sorted before comparing for equality using the `equals` method. The bug might be causing the function to not properly compare blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` in the comparison, ensuring that blocks with the same content but different locations are properly distinguished.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and content to distinguish blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now includes the `block.values` in the tuple, ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are properly distinguished. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the expected output.
