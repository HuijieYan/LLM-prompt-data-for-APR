The bug in the equals function is likely due to the sorting and comparison of the blocks. It seems that the bug is causing the function to return False even when the blocks are equal.

To fix the bug, we can create a custom comparison function for the blocks, which will take into account the dtype name and mgr_locs of each block. Then we can use this custom function to sort and compare the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a custom comparison function for the blocks
    def block_comparison_key(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_comparison_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_comparison_key)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we create a custom comparison function `block_comparison_key` that returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. We then use this function to sort the blocks before comparing them. This should ensure that the blocks are compared correctly and the function returns the correct result.
