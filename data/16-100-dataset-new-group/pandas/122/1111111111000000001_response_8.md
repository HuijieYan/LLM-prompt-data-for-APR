The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to determine if they are equal. However, the issue with the current implementation is that it is comparing the data blocks directly without considering the data types or the order of the columns. This causes the `equals` function to fail in cases where the data blocks are the same, but the data types or column orders are different.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be modified to consider the data types and the order of the columns when comparing the `BlockManager` instances.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare data types and order of columns
    self_data = [(block.values, block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs) for block in self.blocks]
    other_data = [(block.values, block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs) for block in other.blocks]

    return self_data == other_data
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will compare the data blocks along with their data types and column order, ensuring a more accurate comparison between two `BlockManager` instances.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test provided.
