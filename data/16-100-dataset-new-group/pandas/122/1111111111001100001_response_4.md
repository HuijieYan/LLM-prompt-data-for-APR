The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. It appears that the comparison is not considering the actual content of the blocks, but rather some internal representation.

The strategy to fix this bug is to modify the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to consider the actual content of the blocks, rather than sorting and comparing them based on their type and location.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly
    for s_block, o_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not s_block.equals(o_block):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
