The issue in the given buggy function is that it incorrectly checks for equality between two DataFrames. This is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail with the error message `assert True is False`.

The potential error location is in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The incorrect comparison logic is leading to the failure of the test.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic within the `equals` method is incorrect. It is not properly handling the comparison between the two DataFrames.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` method needs to be corrected to accurately check for equality between the two DataFrames.

The corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False
        
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method checks if the other object is an instance of `BlockManager`, compares the axes, consolidates the data in place, checks the number of blocks, and finally compares each block for equality using the `equals` method.

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass without any errors.
