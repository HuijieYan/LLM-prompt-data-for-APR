The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. 

The `equals` function compares two BlockManager instances and returns True if they are identical, including their block locations. However, the bug causing it to return True in cases where the blocks have different locations.

The bug seems to be in the way the `equals` function compares the two BlockManager instances. It first checks if the axes are of equal length and if they are equal, then it consolidates the blocks in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method from the same class. After that, it sorts and compares the blocks of the two instances to check for equality. The bug arises in the comparison of the blocks, where it does not account for different block locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include and compare the block locations. Then, modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the block locations when checking for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.flatten()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we modified the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations by converting them into a tuple. Then, in the main function logic, we ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account the block locations as well, to accurately determine equality. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub report.
