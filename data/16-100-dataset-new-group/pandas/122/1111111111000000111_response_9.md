To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file.

The bug appears to be related to the comparison of DataFrames using the `equals` method, where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly evaluated as being equal.

To correct the bug, we need to sort and canonicalize the block order before checking for equality. This involves ensuring that blocks with the same content but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other class methods...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(), block.dtype.name)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their content and dtype, and then comparing for equality, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

With this corrected version, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test should now pass as expected, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
