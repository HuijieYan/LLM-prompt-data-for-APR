To fix the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the comparison of DataFrames using the `equals()` method. The problem is likely within the logic of the `equals()` function, specifically with how it handles the comparison of blocks.

To resolve the bug, we should update the `equals()` function to account for situations with identical blocks but different locations. We can do this by properly handling the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we've adjusted the `canonicalize()` function to consider both the `mgr_locs` and `values` of the blocks, which should help in correctly identifying and comparing identical blocks with different locations. This change should address the issue identified in the GitHub bug report.

After making this adjustment, the `test_dataframe_not_equal()` test function should pass without triggering the assertion error.
