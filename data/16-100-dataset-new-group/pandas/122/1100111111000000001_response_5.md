The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. The use of `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` may not be functioning as intended.
2. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the class and once outside the class.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function may be due to the incorrect comparison of blocks and the incorrect usage of `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()`.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function and ensure that the consolidation of blocks is done correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other functions...

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` should now pass.
