To fix the bug in the `equals` function, it is important to address the sorting of blocks and their comparison. The bug is likely caused by an incorrect comparison between blocks due to the order in which they are sorted and matched.

The issue seems to be with the sorting and comparing of the blocks in the `equals` function. Since the bug appears to be related to the comparison of blocks, it is recommended to modify the way the blocks are sorted and compared in order to ensure that the comparison is accurate.

The corrected version of the `equals` function would be as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare the blocks
    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(
        self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    )
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(
        other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    )
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently based on their type and locations, and then compare them in the same order. This should address the issue of inaccurate block comparison and fix the bug.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
