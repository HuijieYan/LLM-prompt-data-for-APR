### Bug Analysis
Based on the provided GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations," the expected output of `df3.equals(df4)` is `False`, but the actual behavior is returning `True`, indicating a bug in the `equals` function.

By analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and relevant variables within the `equals` function, we can identify potential error locations. It seems that the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function might be the root cause of the bug.

The critical observation is that the comparison within the `equals` function is failing even when the blocks contain identical data, but their locations are different.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to account for identical blocks with different locations. Instead of directly comparing the blocks, we should compare the content of the blocks to ensure accurate equality.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function that handles the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the content of the blocks to handle identical blocks with different locations
    self_blocks_content = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_content, oblock_content) for block_content, oblock_content in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we compare the content of the blocks using `np.array_equal` to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
