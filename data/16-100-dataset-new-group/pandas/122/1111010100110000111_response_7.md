### Bug Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class has a bug where it incorrectly determines the equality of two data frames. This bug is also reported in a GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. It seems that the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks might produce incorrect orderings.
2. The comparison logic in the return statement could also be incorrect.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` for two data frames that have identical blocks with different locations. This is due to a flaw in the ordering and comparison of the blocks.

#### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Revise the `canonicalize` function to ensure it produces a correct ordering of the blocks based on their type name and locations.
2. Adjust the comparison logic in the return statement to correctly determine the equality of the blocks.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(id(block.dtype)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version addresses the bug by employing a revised `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations. Additionally, the comparison logic in the return statement has been adjusted to accurately determine the equality of the blocks.
