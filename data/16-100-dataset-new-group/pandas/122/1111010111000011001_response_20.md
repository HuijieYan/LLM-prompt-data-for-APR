The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class seems to be comparing two DataFrame objects by first comparing their axes and then their blocks. The issue is likely to be in the comparison of the blocks.

Upon analyzing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, it is expected that when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, the function should return `False` as they have different values in the same column.

The bug occurs because the original implementation of the `equals` function is not comparing the values in the DataFrame blocks. It is only comparing the axes and the structure of the blocks, but not the actual values within the blocks.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the actual values within the blocks of the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, after checking the axes and the structure of the blocks, the function iterates through the blocks of both `self` and `other`, and compares each block using the `equals` function of the blocks.

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the actual values within the blocks, and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass.
