I can see where the issue is occurring. The bug is due to the `equals` function not properly handling the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations. This is leading to the function returning `True` instead of `False` as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks in a way that considers their actual content, not just their locations, to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order by type name and content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are using the `block.values` attribute to compare the actual content of the blocks, along with their data types, in order to properly determine equality. This should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function work as expected.

With this corrected function, the failing test case should now pass and the expected output of `df1.equals(df2)` should be `False`, as intended. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
