The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of blocks before performing the comparison. The provided runtime values and types of variables show that the sorting based on `mgr_locs` might not be correctly handling the comparison between two BlockManagers.

To fix the bug, we can update the `canonicalize` function to include both the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` when sorting the blocks. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account both block types and their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include both the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we ensure that the comparison of blocks considers both the type and the locations, which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
