### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class seems to be designed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. However, the implementation appears to have a bug causing it to return `True` when it should return `False`, as evidenced by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic inside the `canonicalize` function.
2. The comparison of the sorted `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison logic that results in the `equals` function wrongly returning `True` even when the content of the two `BlockManager` instances is not equal.

The issue seems to stem from the way the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks and the subsequent comparison of the sorted `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The comparison logic should be revised to accurately determine the equality of the `BlockManager` instances. The sorting and comparison process should consider the content of the blocks rather than their locations.

### Corrected Version:
Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return [tuple(block.values.ravel()) for block in blocks]

    self_blocks_content = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks_content = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)

    return self_blocks_content == other_blocks_content
```

This corrected version compares the content of the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances, ensuring that the equality comparison is based on the value of the blocks rather than their locations.
