To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to make sure that the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is done correctly without considering the order of blocks. We also need to ensure that the comparison is not affected by the location of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return {(block.dtype.name, block.values.flags.writeable, block.values.tobytes()) for block in blocks}

    return canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks) == canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)
```

In this corrected version, I introduced the `canonicalize_blocks` function to create a canonical representation of the blocks in both `self` and `other` BlockManager objects. This canonical representation considers the block's data type, writability, and bytes, effectively comparing the blocks while ignoring their order and location.

This approach should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function correctly determines the equality of the BlockManager objects.

With this corrected function, the failing test case should now pass and satisfy the expected input/output values as well as resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
