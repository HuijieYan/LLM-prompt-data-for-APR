There are several issues with the buggy function:

1. The function `canonicalize` is defined twice, once outside the `BlockManager` class and once inside. This can cause confusion and errors in the code.

2. The comparison of the `self` and `other` objects is not accurate. The comparison of `self.axes` and `other.axes` does not take into account the actual content of the axes.

3. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function may lead to incorrect comparisons of blocks.

4. The function does not handle the case where the length of `self.blocks` is not equal to the length of `other.blocks`.

To fix the buggy function, you can do the following:

1. Remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function.

2. Update the comparison of `self.axes` and `other.axes` to consider the actual content of the axes, not just their references.

3. Change the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` by directly comparing the blocks.

4. Add a condition to check if the length of `self.blocks` is not equal to the length of `other.blocks` and return `False` in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```
