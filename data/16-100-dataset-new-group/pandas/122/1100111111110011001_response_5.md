The buggy function `equals` has a logical error in sorting and comparing blocks. The function takes two BlockManager instances `self` and `other`. It tries to compare the axes, consolidate the dataframes in place, and then compares the blocks.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different values in their columns. Then, it asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`. However, the buggy function returns `True is False`, leading to an AssertionError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks within the dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Create a dictionary of canonicalized blocks for both self and other
    self_blocks_dict = {}
    for block in self.blocks:
        canonicalized_block = (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        self_blocks_dict[canonicalized_block] = block
    
    other_blocks_dict = {}
    for block in other.blocks:
        canonicalized_block = (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        other_blocks_dict[canonicalized_block] = block
    
    # Compare the canonicalized blocks
    return self_blocks_dict == other_blocks_dict
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the axes of the dataframes are equal. Then it consolidates the dataframes in place and compares the canonicalized blocks of the dataframes using dictionaries. This ensures a correct comparison of the blocks and satisfies the expected input/output values.

The corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and return `False` when comparing the mismatched dataframes `df1` and `df2`.
