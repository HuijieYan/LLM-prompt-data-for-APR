The bug in the function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class improperly returns `True` in cases where identical blocks have different locations. The function is comparing different blocks based on their location, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the function needs to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their location.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(tuple(block.values.to_numpy().ravel()))
    
    self_blocks = [canonicalize(block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [canonicalize(block) for block in other.blocks]
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, I've modified the comparison process to use the hash of the flattened block content as the basis for comparison rather than using block locations. This should ensure that the equality comparison results are accurate, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
