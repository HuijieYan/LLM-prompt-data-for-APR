Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is not correctly determining whether two instances of `BlockManager` are equal. The failing test in the error message and the GitHub issue indicate that the `equals` method is returning True when it should be returning False due to differences in block contents and locations.

The potential error locations within the `equals` method are:

1. The comparison of axes lengths.
2. The comparison of each block within the `BlockManager` objects.

The bug is likely caused by the method not taking into account the locations of the blocks in addition to their contents when determining equality.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the `equals` method to compare the blocks in both `BlockManager` objects while considering their locations. This would involve sorting and comparing the blocks based on their contents and locations, ensuring that the comparison is more robust and accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to canonicalize and compare blocks
    def block_equals(block, oblock):
        return block.equals(oblock) and np.array_equal(block.mgr_locs.as_array, oblock.mgr_locs.as_array)

    # Sort blocks by contents and locations
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version improves the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, taking into account their contents and locations to ensure a more reliable determination of equality. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
