The bug in the provided function seems to be caused by incorrectly comparing the axes and blocks of two different BlockManager objects. The comparison is failing due to a mismatch in the order of the blocks within the BlockManager objects, leading to the `df1.equals(df2) is False` assertion error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within each BlockManager are sorted and compared correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The key change is in sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `sorted` function with a lambda function to create the sorting key based on the block's dtype name and mgr_locs.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
