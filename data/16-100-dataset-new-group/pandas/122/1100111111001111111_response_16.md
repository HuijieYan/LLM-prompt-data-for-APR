## Correction

### Error
The bug causes the `equals` method to return `True` even when the `DataFrame` instances have identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug location
The bug seems to lie in the comparison of individual blocks within the `equals` method. The `canonicalize` function intended to ensure the blocks are compared correctly but fails to do so.

### Cause of the bug
1. The comparison of blocks within the `equals` method does not take into account the potential difference in block locations.
2. The `canonicalize` function, which is supposed to address this issue, does not handle the block locations correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations in its comparison.
2. Update the comparison of individual blocks within the `equals` method to consider block locations.

### Code with Bug Fix

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Revised canonicalize function to include block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexers)
    
    # Sort the blocks based on the revised canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks, including locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the `DataFrame` instances, taking block locations into account, and return the expected result for the failing test case.
