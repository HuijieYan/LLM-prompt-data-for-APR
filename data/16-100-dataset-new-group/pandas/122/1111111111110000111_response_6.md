The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return `True` even when the blocks have different locations. This is evident from the failing test and the GitHub issue description.

The cause of the bug is related to the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` within the `equals` function. The bug occurs due to the use of the `sorted` function for these blocks. The order of the blocks is not being considered, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the blocks should consider the order and location of the blocks. Therefore, the `canonicalize` function should take the block's location into account and return a tuple containing the type name and the `mgr_locs` (manager locations) of the block. This will ensure consistent and accurate comparison of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass. The comparison now considers the order and locations of the blocks, ensuring that it returns the correct result in the case of identical blocks with different locations.
