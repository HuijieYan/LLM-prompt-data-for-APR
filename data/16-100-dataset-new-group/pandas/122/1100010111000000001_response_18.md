## First, analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test:
The buggy function provided is a method named `equals` within the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. This method is used to compare two internal data structures within the pandas library. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is designed to assert that the `equals` method correctly identifies when two dataframes are not equal.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error in the `equals` method is likely related to the comparison of the dataframe blocks and their contents.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the `equals` method causes it to return `True` even when the dataframes are not equal because of the way it compares the blocks and their contents. This causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the blocks and their contents are compared. It might be necessary to review how the method sorts and compares the blocks within the dataframes.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax.equals(other_axes[i]) for i, ax in enumerate(self_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `equals` method should now pass the failing test provided.
