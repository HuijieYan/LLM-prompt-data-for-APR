## Bug Explanation
The buggy function has an issue with comparing blocks using the `equals` method. It inspects the block's dtype and mgr_locs attributes, sorts the blocks based on these attributes, and then compares the blocks for equality. However, if two blocks have identical content but different locations, the function will incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the block contents directly, rather than relying on sorting and comparing attributes. We can achieve this by directly comparing the values within each block for equality without considering the block's location.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        self_blocks[i].values.equals(other_blocks[i].values) for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```
In the corrected version, we compare the block values directly using the `equals` method, ensuring that it correctly identifies differences in the blocks' content without considering their location.

This fix will address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result for comparing blocks.
