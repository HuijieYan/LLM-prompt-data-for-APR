Based on the runtime and expected values provided, the bug in the equals function seems to occur when checking if self_blocks and other_blocks are equal. It appears that the bug is related to the sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function.

The canonicalize function uses the dtype name and mgr_locs as criteria for sorting. However, the dtype name alone may not be sufficient to distinguish between blocks, especially if they have the same dtype. This could lead to unconsolidated blocks being sorted inconsistently.

To fix this bug, we should consider using a more comprehensive approach to sorting the blocks. One solution could be to include additional properties of the blocks that are unique identifiers, ensuring that the canonicalize function sorts the blocks consistently based on these unique properties.

Here's a corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using additional block properties for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.shape, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function now includes block.shape and block.values as additional sorting criteria. This ensures that the blocks are consistently sorted based on a combination of properties that uniquely identify them.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, as well as satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test case provided.
