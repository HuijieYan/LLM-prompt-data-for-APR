The bug in the provided function is likely to be related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `equals` method. The comparison is failing when the order of blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is different, even though the contents of the blocks are the same.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to sort the blocks before comparing them to ensure that the order does not affect the comparison result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks before comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks before comparison, we ensure that the comparison is not affected by the order of the blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. This should fix the bug.
