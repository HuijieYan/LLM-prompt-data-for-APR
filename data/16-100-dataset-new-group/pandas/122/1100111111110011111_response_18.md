## Analysis
The `equals` function is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is used to determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. The key issue with the existing code is that it incorrectly returns `True` for two `BlockManager` instances that are not equal. This was reported in GitHub issue #28839.

The issue is related to how the `BlockManager` instances and their blocks are compared. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparison. However, this function is defined twice: once outside the `BlockManager` class and once inside. This causes a conflict and leads to incorrect comparisons.

The failing test, `test_dataframe_not_equal`, demonstrates that when comparing two dataframes with different values, the `equals` function erroneously returns `True` instead of `False`.

## Bug
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, leading to conflicts in sorting the blocks for comparison. This results in incorrect comparisons and the unexpected return value of `True` instead of `False`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the redundant definition of the `canonicalize` function needs to be removed. Additionally, the sorting logic should be updated to ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted before comparison.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update the sorting logic to ensure correct comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now return the correct result when comparing two `BlockManager` instances, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
