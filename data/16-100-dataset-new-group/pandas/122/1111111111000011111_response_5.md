The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with different locations. The `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` in cases where identical blocks exist at different locations within the DataFrame. This is contrary to the expected behavior, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to properly compare the blocks and handle the issue described in the GitHub post.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block._can_hold_na, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and 
        block._can_hold_na == oblock._can_hold_na and 
        block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. The method `canonicalize` now includes the block values, the indicator of if it can hold NA values, and the block's locations, allowing for a more thorough comparison.
2. The comparison between blocks also includes a check for matching values and locations to properly identify blocks that are equal.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return the correct boolean value based on the comparison of blocks, as expected. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
