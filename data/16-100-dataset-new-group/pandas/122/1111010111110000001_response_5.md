The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file in the `pandas` library. The `equals` method is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager`, but it has an issue causing it to fail on certain comparisons, as evidenced by the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method of `BlockManager` is not correctly handling the comparison of two instances of `BlockManager`. When comparing the two instances `df1` and `df2` in the test function, it expects the result to be `False` because the contents of `df1` and `df2` are different. However, the comparison ends up returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion error.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to ensure that it correctly compares the contents of the two instances.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.to_numpy().tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
With this corrected `equals` method, the comparison of the two instances will produce the expected result and pass the failing test.
