## Correction

The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False` for the failing test case. The issue occurs when checking the equality of blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the function `canonicalize` is not properly capturing and comparing block locations, leading to incorrect equality comparisons between blocks.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly capture and compare block locations. This can be achieved by including the block's location information in the `canonicalize` function, allowing for accurate block equality comparisons.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs to capture block location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly handle equality comparisons between DataFrame blocks with different locations and return the expected result.
