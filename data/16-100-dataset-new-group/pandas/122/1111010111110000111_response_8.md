To fix the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, we need to address the issue with the comparison of data frames that have identical blocks with different locations. The bug is causing `equals` to wrongly return `True` in certain cases, which is not the expected behavior.

Potential Error Location:
The bug may be occurring due to how the function is comparing the blocks between the two data frames. The comparison logic may not be handling cases where the blocks have identical data but are located at different positions within the internal data structure.

Cause of the Bug:
The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` with the provided error message demonstrates that the `df1.equals(df2)` comparison is erroneously returning `True` instead of `False`. This is caused by the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, leading to an unexpected result.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be updated to consider the data blocks in a more robust manner. Instead of relying solely on the order of the blocks, the function should compare the actual content of the blocks to determine equality between two data frames.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare data blocks
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
        self_block_group = self.blocks.get(ax1)
        other_block_group = other.blocks.get(ax2)
        if self_block_group is None or other_block_group is None:
            return False
        for i in range(len(self_block_group)):
            if not self_block_group[i].equals(other_block_group[i]):
                return False
    
    return True
```

By comparing the blocks directly and considering their content, the corrected `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and return the expected result of `False` when comparing the provided data frames `df1` and `df2`. This should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."
