The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class occurs when the function incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This can be reproduced in the provided failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, where it should return `False` but the buggy function returns `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class to properly compare the blocks and their locations. The following corrected version of the function addresses the bug and should resolve the issue:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

# Added the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class for the correct comparison of blocks
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.items.tolist(), block.values)

# Now the corrected version properly compares the blocks and their locations, 
# ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal
```

With the corrected version of the `equals` function, it should now return the expected `False` for the provided failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
