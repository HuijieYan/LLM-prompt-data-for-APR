The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly comparing two BlockManager objects which are expected to be unequal based on the content. The bug arises from the comparison of blocks with the same values but different locations due to the use of the `==` operator, which compares the object identity rather than the content.

To fix the bug, we can update the comparison logic to explicitly compare the values of the blocks instead of relying on the default equality comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the block values explicitly
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the function compares the values of the blocks within the BlockManager objects rather than relying on the default equality comparison for objects. This should ensure that the comparison is based on the content rather than the object identity, which will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function return the expected result for the failing test case.
