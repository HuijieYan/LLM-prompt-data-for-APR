The buggy function `equals` is not properly comparing two DataFrames. The error message from the failing test indicates that it is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

### Bug Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames. The function fails to correctly compare the blocks present in the DataFrames, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Location:
The issue seems to be with the logic for comparing the block data within the DataFrames, as it is not properly sorting and comparing the block elements.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames, resulting in the incorrect comparison results. It fails to effectively compare the blocks based on their content and order, leading to the `True` assertion error in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that it correctly compares the blocks within the DataFrames by sorting and comparing them based on their content and order.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort and compare the blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected function sorts and compares the blocks based on their values and location, ensuring a proper comparison of the DataFrames.

After making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.

This fix also resolves the issue posted on GitHub titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".
