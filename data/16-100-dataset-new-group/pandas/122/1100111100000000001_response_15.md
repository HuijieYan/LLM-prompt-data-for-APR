## Analysis:
The buggy function "equals" is comparing two BlockManager objects for equality. It first checks if the number of axes is the same, and if not, returns False. Then it proceeds to compare the axes and consolidate the blocks in both objects. Finally, it sorts the blocks and checks if they are all equal.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function is calling `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` without checking for any potential errors that could occur during consolidation.
2. The function defines a nested `canonicalize` function, which could possibly cause confusion and errors due to scoping issues.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function may arise due to incorrect or inconsistent block consolidation, which could lead to incorrect comparison results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for potential errors during block consolidation and handle them appropriately.
2. Remove the nested `canonicalize` function and use a separate function or lambda for sorting the blocks in a canonical order.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas.core.internals.managers as managers

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions)

    # The corrected equals function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        # Check for errors during consolidation
        try:
            self._consolidate_inplace()
            other._consolidate_inplace()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during consolidation: {e}")
            return False
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Sort the blocks using a lambda function for canonicalization
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a try-except block to handle any potential errors during consolidation. We have also replaced the nested `canonicalize` function with a lambda function for sorting the blocks in a canonical order. This should help address the potential issues and improve the stability of the function.
