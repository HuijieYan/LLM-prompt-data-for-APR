The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to an incorrect comparison between dataframes with columns of different types. The bug causes the function to return `True` even when the data contains columns of different types.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to take into account the types of the columns when comparing the dataframes.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modified `equals` function, the dataframes are compared by taking into account the type of each block, ensuring a correct comparison between dataframes with columns of different types. This will fix the bug and the function should now pass the failing test case.
