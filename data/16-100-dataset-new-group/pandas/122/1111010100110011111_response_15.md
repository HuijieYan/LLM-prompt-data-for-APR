The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module. The function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and block attributes. However, the failing test and the associated GitHub issue indicate that the function incorrectly returns `True` in cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the comparison of block equality and the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling scenarios where the content of the blocks is identical but their locations are different, leading to an incorrect equality comparison.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to consider both block content and location when determining equality.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function takes into account both the block values and their locations when sorting the blocks for comparison. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are not erroneously considered equal.
