### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is not comparing two dataframes correctly and is returning the wrong result. The failing test is for the `equals` method of DataFrames in Pandas, which is expected to return `False` for the given input, but it returns `True` instead.

The underlying bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. The error message indicates that it is comparing the dataframes and is expecting the result to be `False`, but it is receiving `True` instead.

Looking at the GitHub issue, it is clear that this bug is causing the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False` for the given test case.

### Bug Identification
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of individual blocks within the DataFrames in the `equals` function.
2. The sorting and canonicalization of the blocks may not be correctly identifying the differences between DataFrames.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the way the blocks are compared and sorted. The incorrect comparison and canonicalization of block order are causing the `equals` function to return an incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks within DataFrames should be accurately identifying the differences between the DataFrames. The sorting and canonicalization process should correctly order the blocks to ensure accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function includes a modification to the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's values as well, ensuring a more accurate comparison and sorting. This change should address the underlying issue and resolve the incorrect result returned by the `equals` function.
