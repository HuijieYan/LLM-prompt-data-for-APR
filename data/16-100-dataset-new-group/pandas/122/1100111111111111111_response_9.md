To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the incorrect comparison of the block locations for identical blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The bug causes the `equals` function to wrongly return True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

The issue arises from the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which is meant to handle different block locations but mistakenly considers them as different blocks. To resolve this, we need to adjust the `canonicalize` function to handle identical blocks correctly, regardless of their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # this is the buggy function fixed
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            if isinstance(block, (tuple, list)):
                return [(b.dtype.name, b.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for b in block]
            else:
                return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

In the corrected version, we updated the `canonicalize` function to handle both single blocks and lists of blocks. This modification ensures that the comparison accounts for identical blocks regardless of their locations within the block manager.

With this fix, the `equals` function should correctly return False when comparing the provided test case, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
