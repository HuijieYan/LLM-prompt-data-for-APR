## Bug Fix

### Analysis:
The `equals` function compares the attributes of two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal. However, the comparison approach in the `equals` function does not effectively handle the comparison of blocks with different locations. This leads to incorrect equality evaluation, as evidenced by the failing test case and the GitHub issue.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function returns `True` when it is expected to return `False` due to the different block locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison approach in the `equals` function needs to be modified to consider the block locations as well.

### Bug Fix:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self.canonicalize_blocks()
    other.canonicalize_blocks()
    
    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
    
def canonicalize_blocks(self):
    # canonicalize block order using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    # because there might be unconsolidated blocks which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self.blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
```

In this bug fix, I introduced a new method `canonicalize_blocks` within the `BlockManager` class. This method sorts the `blocks` attribute using the `canonicalize` function as the key for comparison. The `equals` function then calls this method for both `self` and `other` before comparing their blocks.

This approach ensures that the block order is canonicalized based on type name and block locations, enabling a more accurate comparison of `BlockManager` instances.

These changes address the reported issue and resolve the bug.
