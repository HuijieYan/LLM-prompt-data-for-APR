The buggy function `equals` is used to check if two BlockManager objects are equal. However, the function contains a bug that causes it to incorrectly identify two BlockManager objects as not equal when they are in fact equal. This bug is causing the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

The bug occurs in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks within the BlockManager objects before comparing them for equality. The bug may be related to how the `canonicalize` function compares and sorts the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to correctly compare and sort the blocks within the BlockManager objects. Additionally, we should ensure that the comparison of the axes and blocks themselves is correct.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the sorting of the blocks and simplifying the comparison, we can ensure that the `equals` function properly checks for equality between the BlockManager objects. This should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
