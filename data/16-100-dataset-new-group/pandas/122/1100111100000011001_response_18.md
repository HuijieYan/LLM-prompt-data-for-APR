The cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once at the class level and once within the `equals` method. The `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method is supposed to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs.

To fix the bug, we should remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function and ensure that it is only defined once within the `BlockManager` class. We should also check the usage of `dtype` and `mgr_locs` within the `canonicalize` function to ensure they are being used correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the duplicate definition of `canonicalize` and ensuring it is used correctly to sort the blocks, this corrected version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
