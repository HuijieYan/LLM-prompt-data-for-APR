Based on the information provided, the bug in the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class appears to be caused by the failure to properly compare and handle the order of different blocks. The function sorts the blocks using the custom `canonicalize` function, but there seems to be an issue in the sorting process, leading to the incorrect equality comparison observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the sorting process needs to be revised to appropriately compare and sort the blocks based on their content. Additionally, it may be necessary to update the comparison logic as well.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, instead of using a custom `canonicalize` function, the blocks are sorted based on their `values`. This change should ensure that the equivalence comparison is performed correctly, resolving the issue outlined in the failing test and the related GitHub issue.
