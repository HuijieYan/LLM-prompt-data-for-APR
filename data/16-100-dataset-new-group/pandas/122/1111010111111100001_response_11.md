The issue with the `equals` function is that it does not compare the actual data in the DataFrame objects `self` and `other`, but instead, it compares their internal BlockManager objects. This causes the function to return `True` even for DataFrames with different data, as long as they have the same internal block configuration.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual data within the DataFrames `self` and `other`, rather than comparing their internal BlockManager objects.

Here is the updated and corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, pd.DataFrame):
        return False
    
    # Check if shapes are different
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False

    # Check if the column names are different
    if not all(self.columns == other.columns):
        return False

    # Convert the DataFrames to numpy arrays and compare the data
    return (self.values == other.values).all()
```

With this updated version, the `equals` function will correctly compare the actual data within the DataFrames, ensuring that the comparison is based on the content of the DataFrames rather than their internal structure.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
