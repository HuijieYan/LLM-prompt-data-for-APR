### Approach
The bug is likely causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail, returning `True` instead of the expected `False`. The bug may be in the `equals` function's comparison logic or in the `canonicalize` function used to sort and compare the blocks. We will need to ensure that the comparison logic is accurately checking for equality and that the `canonicalize` function is producing consistent and correct results for comparison.

### Corrected Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype),  # Convert dtype to string for comparison
                tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to convert dtype to string and convert `mgr_locs.as_array` to a tuple, we ensure consistent and correct comparison of blocks.

This corrected version should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test now returns the expected `False` value.
