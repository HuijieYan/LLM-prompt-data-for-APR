The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. Comparison of the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without verifying that they are not empty.
2. Use of the `equals` method inside the `canonicalize` function without checking if the block types are actually comparable.

The cause of the bug is due to the comparison of axes and blocks without first ensuring that they are not empty. Additionally, the comparison of block types using the `equals` method could lead to a potential error if the block types are not directly comparable using the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to add checks for empty axes and blocks before performing comparisons. Additionally, the comparison of block types could be improved by utilizing a more robust method for comparing the types.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.axes or not other.axes:
        return False  # One of the axes is empty, cannot compare

    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if not self.blocks or not other.blocks:
        return False  # One of the block lists is empty, cannot compare

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Using the block type name for comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
With these changes, the function now includes checks for empty axes and blocks before comparisons, and uses the block type names for comparison within the `canonicalize` function.
