The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should be returning `False` for certain test cases, as described in the GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The bug occurs due to how the function compares blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. In particular, the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function is not properly taking into account the block locations, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations when sorting the blocks. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly distinguished.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (rest of the class definition)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # modified canonicalize function to include block locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now properly distinguish between identical blocks with different locations and return the expected result, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
