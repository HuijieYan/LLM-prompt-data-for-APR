The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class and checks if they are equal. It also calls the `_consolidate_inplace` function from the same class. The potential error locations within the function are the comparisons of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, as well as the comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of the two instances. Additionally, there is an unused `canonicalize` function within the class that should be utilized.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparisons of axes and blocks are done correctly and make use of the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks before comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the axes of both instances `self` and `other` are compared correctly. The `_consolidate_inplace` function is called on both instances, and the blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function before comparison. This should fix the bug in the `equals` function.
