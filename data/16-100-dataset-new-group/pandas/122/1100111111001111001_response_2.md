The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test because the function is not properly comparing the `self` and `other` BlockManager objects. The function is incorrectly comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `equals` method for the blocks themselves, instead of comparing the elements of the `blocks` attribute. This causes the comparison to fail, leading to the test failing.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to properly compare the elements of the `blocks` attribute in the `self` and `other` BlockManager objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected code, the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class should now properly compare the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` elements, satisfying the expected input/output values and passing the failing test.
