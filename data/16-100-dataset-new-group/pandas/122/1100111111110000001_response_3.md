The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. This method is called when comparing two DataFrames for equality, as shown in the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class does not properly compare the DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, resulting in the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to correctly compare the two DataFrames element-wise and return the appropriate boolean value.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
# within the BlockManager class in managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

With this change, the `equals` method directly compares the underlying numpy arrays of the DataFrames `self` and `other`, which ensures a correct equality check.

This corrected version of the `equals` method should pass the failing test.
