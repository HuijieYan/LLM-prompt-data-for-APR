To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the following issues:

1. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`. We need to ensure that the comparison is done correctly.

2. The function `canonicalize` is being redefined within the class, which is unnecessary and can lead to confusion. We need to remove the redefined `canonicalize` function.

3. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is not being done correctly. We need to ensure that the sorting is done based on the type name and `mgr_locs`.

To fix these issues, we can make the following corrections:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sorting based on type name and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that the comparison of axes is done correctly, the `canonicalize` function is not redefined, and the blocks are sorted based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. This should address the issues and make the function pass the failing test.
