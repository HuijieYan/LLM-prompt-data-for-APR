The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is causing the DataFrame `equals` method to return `True` when it should return `False` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This bug is identified in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file, and it corresponds to the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the comparison of the blocks of the DataFrame by canonicalizing the block order using the type name and manager locations.

The bug is caused by the fact that in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, the comparison of the blocks is not taking into account the different locations of the identical blocks, resulting in a `True` return when it should actually return `False`.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class should actively compare the locations of the identical blocks in addition to their content. This can be achieved by incorporating the location information of the blocks into the canonicalization process, ensuring that the comparison of the blocks also considers their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Include block location comparison in addition to their content
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.
