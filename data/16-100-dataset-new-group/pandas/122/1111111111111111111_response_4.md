The issue with the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is that it is not correctly comparing two DataFrames. The problem arises when checking whether identical blocks with different locations are considered equal. This results in the method `equals` wrongly returning `True` instead of `False` in such cases.

The cause of this bug is that the `equals` method does not properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation. This can be seen in the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`, which expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but the actual result is `True`.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should properly handle block locations when comparing DataFrames. Additionally, the `equals` method should utilize the updated `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks and accurately determine the equality of two DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # compare the axes
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False

    # consolidate blocks for both self and other
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # compare the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order with correct handling of block locations 
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values._determine_dtype(),
                tuple(block.values._mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # compare each pair of blocks
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected `equals` method, the failing test should now pass as it accurately compares the DataFrames' blocks and correctly evaluates the equality between them.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensures that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class behaves as expected when comparing DataFrames.
