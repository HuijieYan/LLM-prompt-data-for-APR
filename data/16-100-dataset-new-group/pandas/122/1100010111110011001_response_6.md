The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect comparison of the two dataframes. The function is not correctly comparing the dataframes and returning False when they are not equal.

To fix the bug, we will modify the equals function to compare the dataframes element-wise instead of the current implementation, which is not comparing the dataframes correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Check if the dataframes have the same elements
    return self.to_numpy().tolist() == other.to_numpy().tolist()
```

This corrected version of the function uses the `to_numpy()` method to convert the dataframes to numpy arrays and then compares the arrays element-wise to determine if the dataframes are equal.

With this correction, the function will now correctly compare the dataframes and return the expected result.
