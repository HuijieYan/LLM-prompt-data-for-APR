The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The comparison is supposed to check if the two `BlockManager` instances are equal, but it fails to consider the order of blocks and their types. This leads to incorrect comparisons and results in an unexpected return value.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method should be modified to properly compare the blocks based on their type and locations. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the comparison is consistent and accurate even in cases where the blocks' order may differ.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on type and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the block types and locations when comparing, we can ensure a more reliable and accurate comparison between the `BlockManager` instances. This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected output in cases where identical blocks with different locations are compared.
