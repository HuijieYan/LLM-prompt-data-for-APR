The bug in the `equals` method is causing it to return `True` incorrectly in cases where it should return `False`, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the `block` canonicalization process. The `canonicalize` function should take `block` as a parameter, but it is defined as a standalone function within the `equals` method. This causes the `canonicalize` function to use a block from the outer scope, which might lead to unexpected results when comparing blocks from different dataframes.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should take a `block` parameter, and the sorting and comparison process within the `equals` method should be revised to use the correct block parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function inside equals to take a block parameter
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    # Sort the blocks using the canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making these changes, the `equals` method will correctly compare the blocks from different dataframes, and the failing test should now pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
