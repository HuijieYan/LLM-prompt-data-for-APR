The bug in the equals function is that the canonicalize function is defined twice, once within the BlockManager class and once outside of it. When the canonicalize function is called, it refers to the one defined outside of the class. This results in an error and potentially unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should remove the duplicate definition of the canonicalize function and ensure that the function is called within the BlockManager class.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions from the same class are called by the buggy function
    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
