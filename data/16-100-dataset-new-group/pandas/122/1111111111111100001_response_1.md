The bug in the `equals` function is likely causing it to return `True` incorrectly. The function performs multiple checks and comparisons on different attributes of two `BlockManager` objects. Some potential error locations include:
1. Comparing the `self.axes` and `other.axes` lists without considering the order of the elements within them.
2. Sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function, which may not be properly implemented.
3. The `canonicalize` function itself may not be creating consistent tuple representations for blocks.

The failing test involves comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the comparison returned `True` when it was expected to be `False`.

To fix the bug in the `equals` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Implement a consistent sorting mechanism in the `canonicalize` function to properly order the blocks for comparison.
2. Modify the comparison of `self.axes` and `other.axes` to take into account the order of elements within the lists.
3. Review the comparison logic to ensure that it correctly identifies differences between the two `BlockManager` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a consistent sorting mechanism
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.indexer)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `equals` function should compare the `BlockManager` objects correctly, and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any assertions.
