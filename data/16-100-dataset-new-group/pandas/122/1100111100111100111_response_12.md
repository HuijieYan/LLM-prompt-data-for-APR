The bug in the provided function `equals` is causing it to return `True` incorrectly, leading to failing tests. The bug appears to be related to the comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The issue reported on GitHub specifies that the expected output for a particular test case is `False`, but the actual output is `True`.

The bug seems to be related to how the `canonicalize` function is handling the `block` objects and their `dtype` attribute. When sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function, the sorting is not taking into account the block items correctly, causing the wrong comparison and resulting in the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly handle the block items and their data type. Additionally, the comparison of the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists needs to be adjusted to account for this change.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Modify the canonicalize function to handle block dtype correctly

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block's `dtype` and by using the `str` function to convert it to a string, we ensure that the sorting is done correctly based on the block's data type. This should resolve the bug and make the function return the correct output, thereby passing the failing test case.
