To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the `equals` method correctly compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison of the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class does not correctly compare the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to accurately compare the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the corrected `equals` method, it should now pass the failing test and return the expected output.
