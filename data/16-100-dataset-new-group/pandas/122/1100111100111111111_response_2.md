Based on the runtime values and types of variables, as well as the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution, it seems that the issue arises from the comparison of block locations in the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparison, but it does not handle the block locations correctly. This causes the `equals` function to return an incorrect value.

To fix this issue, the `canonicalize` function needs to handle the block locations in a way that ensures identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal. Additionally, the way the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks needs to be reviewed to ensure that it correctly reflects the equality of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.indexer,
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `canonicalize` function includes the block locations in its sorting mechanism, preventing identical blocks with different locations from being considered equal. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
