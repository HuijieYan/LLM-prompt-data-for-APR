The bug in the `equals` function is causing the comparison of two DataFrames to incorrectly return `True` when they should be considered unequal. This is evidenced by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provided in the GitHub issue. 

The incorrect behavior of the `equals` function is likely due to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing them. The sorting is done based on a canonicalization function that returns a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs` of the blocks. However, the `mgr_locs` need to be transformed into a list before creating the tuple using `as_array.tolist()`. This transformation might not be consistent when comparing blocks, leading to incorrect sorting and subsequent comparison.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to consistently handle the transformation of `mgr_locs`. The transformation should be applied to both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before conducting the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `equals` function should correctly compare the DataFrames and return the expected output of `False` for the failing test.
