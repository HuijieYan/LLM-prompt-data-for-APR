The identified bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. The bug occurs because the method attempts to compare two `BlockManager` instances, `self` and `other`, using the `equals` method of the underlying blocks, which results in unexpected behavior when the blocks are sorted within the method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between `BlockManager` instances is handled correctly, considering the layout and equivalence of their underlying blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return tuple((block.shape, block.get_values()) for block in blocks)

    self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected version compares the blocks based on their shape and values, ensuring that the comparison between `BlockManager` instances is properly handled. This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes.
