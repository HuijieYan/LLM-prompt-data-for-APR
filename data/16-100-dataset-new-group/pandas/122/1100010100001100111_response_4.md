The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations, while the expected output is False.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are identified in the `canonicalize` function that's used to sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The issue is likely to be related to how the `mgr_locs` attribute is being used in the `canonicalize` function. 

The cause of the bug is likely that the `canonicalize` function is not correctly handling the `mgr_locs` attribute, which is essential for distinguishing blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly accounts for the different locations of the blocks. This can be done by modifying the `canonicalize` function and the sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and the location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.slice, block.mgr_locs.step)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the `mgr_locs.slice` and `mgr_locs.step` attributes, in addition to the `dtype.name`, to correctly identify and sort the blocks based on their type and location.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the `equals` function returns the expected output.
