The bug in the function is likely caused by the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their data type and locations, but it seems to be improperly defined within the `equals` function, causing the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to fail.

To fix this bug, we should define the `canonicalize` function properly outside of the `equals` function and pass it as a key function to the `sorted` function to sort the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected `canonicalize` function defined outside of `equals` and used as the key function in the `sorted` calls, the function should now pass the failing test.
