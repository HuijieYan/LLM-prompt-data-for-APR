The cause of the bug is that the equals function is comparing the blocks based on their order, which causes incorrect comparison results. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` failed. This means that the equals function is returning True when it should be returning False, leading to the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their order.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on content
    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other.blocks) and
        any(oblock.equals(block) for block in self.blocks)
        for block in self.blocks
    )
```

This fix ensures that each block in `self.blocks` has an equivalent block in `other.blocks`, and vice versa. This should address the bug and make the equals function return the correct result for the failing test case.
