The bug in the `equals` function seems to arise from the comparison of blocks with the same data but different locations, causing the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`. This issue is confirmed by the provided runtime values and types of variables, where the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` contain different block locations and data order.

To fix this issue, we can sort the blocks based on their data type and manager locations. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are compared correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted based on the `canonicalize` function, which accounts for both the data type and manager locations to ensure the comparison is consistent.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and prevent the `equals` function from wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
