The buggy function appears to compare the equality of two BlockManager instances, where each instance holds axes and blocks. The function performs several checks for equality, and at the end, it compares individual blocks for equality.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of axes lengths without handling the possibility of different lengths causing a false negative result.
2. The sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks based on the canonicalize function, which may lead to incorrect comparisons due to unconsolidated blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the possibility of different lengths of axes, leading to a false negative result. Additionally, sorting the blocks based on canonicalize might produce incorrect comparisons for unconsolidated blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to handle cases where the length of axes is different and revise the sorting logic of self_blocks and other_blocks based on canonicalize.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should handle cases where the length of axes is different and provide a correct comparison of the blocks. This should address the failing test case provided.
