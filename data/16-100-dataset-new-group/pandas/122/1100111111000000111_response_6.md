The buggy function `equals(self, other)` from the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file wrongly returns True in cases of identical blocks with different locations. This bug was reported in a GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The issue seems to be related to the comparison of DataFrames using the `.equals()` method, as demonstrated in the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` from the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not be taking into account block locations.
2. The canonicalization process for sorting blocks may not be handling different block locations properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison process to include block locations, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly deemed as equal.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks by type name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.index)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is modified to use the block's type name and locations to sort the blocks. This ensures that blocks are correctly compared, taking into account their locations.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
