Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the logic used to compare the blocks and their order between `self` and `other`. 

The issue seems to be with the `canonicalize` function, which is used to compare the blocks. The current implementation of `canonicalize` is likely not handling the block comparison correctly, leading to the failing test case.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should properly handle the comparison of blocks. Additionally, the comparison logic in the `equals` function should be revised to ensure that the blocks are being compared correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should address the issues with block comparison and ensure that the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes successfully.
