The bug in the provided function appears to be due to the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once in the class and once outside the class, leading to potential confusion and ambiguity.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function and use the correct implementation that is defined within the class.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function removes the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function and uses the correct implementation from within the class.

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
