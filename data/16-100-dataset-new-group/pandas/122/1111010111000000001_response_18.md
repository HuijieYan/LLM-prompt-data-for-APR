## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the data in place
    self.consolidate(inplace=True)
    other.consolidate(inplace=True)
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to canonicalize the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._can_hold_na, block._simple_new_dtype, type(block))

    # Sort the blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
The original buggy function has issues with the way it handles block consolidation and comparison. It also doesn't handle the case where DataFrames have different data types. The failing test case 'test_dataframe_not_equal' simply checks if two DataFrames are not equal, but the original buggy function does not handle this case correctly.

To fix the bug, the corrected function ensures that the data is consolidated in place for both self and other. Then, it defines a canonicalize function to sort the blocks based on their characteristics. Finally, it compares each block from self with the corresponding block from other and returns the result.

The corrected function should pass the failing test case 'test_dataframe_not_equal'.
