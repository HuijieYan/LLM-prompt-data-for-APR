The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames. The issue is related to identical blocks with different locations.

The root cause of this bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not correctly determining the unique characteristics of each block, resulting in blocks with different locations being considered as identical. This leads to the `equals` function incorrectly returning `True`.

To fix this bug, I suggest modifying the `canonicalize` function to accurately capture the unique characteristics of each block.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly identify and compare the blocks within the DataFrames, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test.
