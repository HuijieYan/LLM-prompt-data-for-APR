The bug in the `equals` function seems to be causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal, but it does not seem to be working correctly.

The potential errors in the `equals` function include:
1. Using `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` before comparing the blocks. This may affect the equality check as the blocks might be modified during consolidation.
2. The sorting logic based on the `canonicalize` function might not be correctly comparing the blocks.

The cause of the bug:
The `equals` function is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` objects. The function first compares the axes of the two objects. If the axes are not equal, it returns False. Then, it consolidates both objects in place, but this may modify the internal structure of the objects. After that, it compares the number of blocks and sorts the blocks based on their type and location, but this sorting logic may not correctly handle all cases.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Avoid modifying the objects in place, as it may affect the comparison. Instead, create consolidated copies of the objects and then perform the comparison.
2. Rewrite the logic for sorting and comparing the blocks to ensure a correct comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    
    # Create consolidated copies of self and other
    self_copy = self.copy()
    other_copy = other.copy()
    
    # Ensure the consolidation is performed on the copies
    self_copy._consolidate_inplace()
    other_copy._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self_copy.blocks) != len(other_copy.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_copy.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_copy.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the issues with modifying the objects in place and provide a more accurate comparison of the blocks.
