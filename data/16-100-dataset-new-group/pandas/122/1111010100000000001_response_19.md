There are several potential error locations within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class:
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without checking for `None` values or existence of the axes.
2. The comparison of lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without any error handling for `None` or existence of the blocks.
3. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without checking for `None` values.
4. The comparison of `block.equals(oblock)` without checking for `None` or existence of the blocks.

The potential cause of the bug seems to be that the function `equals` does not handle cases where `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `self.blocks`, or `other.blocks` are `None` or do not exist, which leads to potential errors during comparison and sorting.

To fix the bug, error handling should be added to check for the existence and validity of `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `self.blocks`, and `other.blocks`. Additionally, the sorting and comparison should be handled based on the actual data available.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if self_axes is None or other_axes is None or len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if self.blocks is None or other.blocks is None or len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if block is None:
            return None
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if any(b is None for b in self_blocks) or any(b is None for b in other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, error handling has been added to check for `None` values and existence of `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `self.blocks`, and `other.blocks`. Additionally, a check for `None` values has been added when sorting and comparing the blocks.
