The bug in the equals function is causing it to incorrectly return True in the case of identical blocks with different locations, which is not the expected behavior. This is confirmed by the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations," where the user expected the function to return False in a specific test case but received True instead.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparison of block locations using `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` and the comparison of the blocks using `block.equals(oblock)`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not considering blocks with different locations as unequal, leading to incorrect True returns. This is evident from the runtime values and types of the input parameters, which include identical blocks with different locations. The expected values and types of variables indicate that the function should return False for the given input, but it incorrectly returns True due to the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations. One possible strategy is to compare the blocks directly based on their content rather than their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been replaced with a lambda function to sort the blocks based on their content. This change ensures that the blocks are compared directly by their values, resolving the issue of incorrectly returning True for identical blocks with different locations.
