The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should be returning `False`, as confirmed by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The bug is likely due to the sorting method `canonicalize`, which is attempting to sort the blocks using a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`. The issue in GitHub further confirms that the `equals` function is failing to return the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` method such that it accurately sorts the blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the comparison of the individual blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is done accurately to return the correct result.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the `canonicalize` method to accurately sort the blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, we have iterated through the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to compare the individual blocks using the `equals` method. This correction should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result.

By making these changes, the failing test should now pass and the issue on GitHub should be resolved.
