The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to sorting the blocks by their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. The current implementation doesn't handle different data types correctly and could lead to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to properly handle different data types before sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple including the block type and its data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.get_values()), block.mgr_locs.indexer)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include both the values and the index locations of the block, we can ensure that different block types and data values are handled correctly when sorting. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
