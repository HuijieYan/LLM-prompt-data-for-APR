The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of DataFrames where the blocks are identical but in different locations. This is causing the `equals` function to return `True` erroneously.

The cause of the bug can be identified in the `equals` function itself. When comparing the blocks of the dataframes, they are sorted based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which is intended to canonicalize the order. However, the comparison is made based on the sorted order, leading to a mismatch between identical blocks in different locations.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to compare the blocks without sorting them, as the order of the blocks should not affect the comparison result. Additionally, if the lengths of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are not equal, the function should return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks without sorting
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations should now return the expected result, and the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass successfully.
