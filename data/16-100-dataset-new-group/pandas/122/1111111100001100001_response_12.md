Based on the provided information and the runtime values, the buggy function compares two BlockManager instances by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the bug occurs in the comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks, where the canonicalization of blocks is not handled correctly, leading to false negatives.

The bug arises because the canonicalize function is not correctly implemented to handle the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. As a result, the function fails to properly compare the blocks.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function needs to be modified to correctly handle the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. Additionally, the comparison logic using canonicalized blocks should be adjusted to ensure a proper comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
