The buggy function fails because it sorts the blocks of two BlockManagers differently, resulting in the assertion that they are not equal when they should be. The cause of this bug is that the canonicalize function used to sort the blocks is defined twice - once outside of the BlockManager class and once within the BlockManager class. The canonicalize function inside the BlockManager class is never called, leading to incorrect sorting.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class should be called instead of defining it again outside the class.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the correct canonicalize function defined within the BlockManager class, the function should now pass the failing test case.
