The buggy function `equals` in the class `BlockManager` is causing the issue where the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test is failing, returning `assert True is False`. This issue is also posted on GitHub with the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The issue states that when `df3.equals(df4)` is called, it is expected to return False, but it is actually returning True.

The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that it is not correctly comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames, leading to the incorrect True result. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are equal, then it compares the axes, consolidates the data, and finally compares the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. There is a flaw in the logic used to compare the blocks, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the blocks needs to be modified. The correct strategy would be to compare the elements of the blocks directly, ensuring that their order and values match. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        (block.values == oblock.values).all() for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function directly compares the values of the blocks using the NumPy `array_equal` function, ensuring that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the blocks. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
