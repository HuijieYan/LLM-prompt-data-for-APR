The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of internal data structures within the `BlockManager` class. This leads to an AssertionError in the failing test.

The main issue is with the sorting of the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function fails to correctly compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances, leading to the incorrect return value when checking for equality.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly compare and sort the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` instances. This will ensure that the equality comparison returns the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare the blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks properly and comparing their values, the corrected `equals` function will now return the correct result and pass the failing test.
