The buggy function `equals` is located in the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The function is used to check for equality between two instances of `BlockManager`. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the given test case.

The potential error locations within the function are the conditional statements and the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. If the sorting does not consider the actual equality of the blocks, it might lead to incorrect comparison results.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block._values._data, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `block._values._data` to uniquely identify the blocks for sorting. The remaining parts of the function remain unchanged. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
