The bug in the equals function is causing the method to wrongly return True in cases where there are identical blocks with different locations. This issue was reported in GitHub, where a user expected the function to return False for the comparison between two DataFrames but it returned True instead.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks, as well as the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks using the canonicalize function. It seems that the comparison of blocks and the sorting method may not be effectively handling cases where the blocks have identical contents but different locations.

The cause of the bug is the inefficient handling of blocks with identical content but different locations. The function's implementation of canonicalize and the comparison of blocks do not effectively address this scenario, leading to incorrect return values for the equals function.

To fix the bug, a revised sorting and comparison strategy should be implemented to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal. This could involve considering the location of blocks within the sorting mechanism, or modifying the comparison logic to account for the possibility of identical content in different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_block_tuples = [(canonicalize(block), block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_tuples = [(canonicalize(block), block) for block in other.blocks]

    self_blocks_sorted = [block for _, block in sorted(self_block_tuples)]
    other_blocks_sorted = [block for _, block in sorted(other_block_tuples)]

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use block.mgr_locs and block.values along with block.dtype.name in the canonicalize function to ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are not mistakenly identified as equal during the sorting process. Then, the sorted self_blocks and other_blocks are compared to accurately determine their equality.

This revised approach should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the equals function correctly handles cases with identical blocks in different locations.
