The issue with the `BlockManager.equals` function is that it wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is evident from the provided test case where `df3.equals(df4)` is expected to return False but returns True instead.

The problem occurs because the `equals` function of `BlockManager` sorts the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. This can lead to identical blocks with different locations being considered equal when they should not.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional information to differentiate blocks with identical type name and `mgr_locs`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and size to differentiate identical blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), len(block))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the modified `canonicalize` function, we added `len(block)` to the tuple to differentiate blocks with identical type name and `mgr_locs` but different sizes. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not wrongly considered equal.

With this fix, the `BlockManager.equals` function should now correctly handle identical blocks with different locations and return the expected result for the provided test case.
