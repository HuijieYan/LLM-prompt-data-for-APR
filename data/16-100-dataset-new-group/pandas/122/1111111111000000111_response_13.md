The buggy function `equals` from the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is causing the DataFrame equals comparison to incorrectly return True even when the blocks have different locations.

The bug is caused by the use of the `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` functions before the comparison of blocks. These functions are supposed to consolidate the blocks within the `BlockManager`, but they may impact the comparison by altering the internal structure of the blocks.

To fix this bug, the `BlockManager.equals` function should be modified to remove the calls to `_consolidate_inplace()` before comparing the blocks. This will ensure that the comparison is based on the original unaltered blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this corrected version, the comparison of DataFrame blocks within the `BlockManager` should behave as expected and return False for the provided failing test case.
