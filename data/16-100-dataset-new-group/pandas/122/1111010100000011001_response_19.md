The bug in the equals function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks between the two BlockManager objects. The code sorts the blocks in both self and other BlockManager instances using a canonicalize function. However, the sorting logic seems to be incorrect, leading to the equals function not returning the expected result.

To fix the bug, we need to review the sorting logic in the canonicalize function and ensure that it accurately represents the unique identifiers of the blocks for proper comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the data inplace
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (type(x).__name__, x.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (type(x).__name__, x.mgr_locs))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks in both self and other BlockManager instances are sorted using a lambda function that combines the type name and the block's mgr_locs. This provides a unique and consistent sorting order for the blocks, allowing for accurate comparison.

With this correction, the equals function should now return the expected result based on the input parameters and variable states.
