### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two BlockManager objects. The error message indicates that the comparison is not returning the expected result, leading to a failing test. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of the two DataFrames, as indicated by the error message.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may be incorrect.
2. The canonicalization of block order using the `canonicalize` function could be causing the issue.
3. The implementation of the `as_array` and `_consolidate_inplace` functions should also be considered.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks within the `equals` function. It may not be handling the data within the DataFrames correctly, leading to unexpected results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is accurate.
2. Review the `canonicalize` function and its implementation to confirm that it correctly handles the sorting of blocks.
3. Check the implementation of the `as_array` and `_consolidate_inplace` functions to validate their behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    # Consolidate inplace for both self and other
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.mgr_locs[n]
            if isinstance(block.mgr_locs, list)
            else tuple(sorted(block.mgr_locs.items()))
        )  # sort on labels if a dict
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This corrected version addresses the potential issues in the original function, including the sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. It also consolidates the data inplace for both `self` and `other`.
