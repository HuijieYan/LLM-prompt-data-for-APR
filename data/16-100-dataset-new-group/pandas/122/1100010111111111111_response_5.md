The problem with the provided equals function is that it is not correctly comparing the DataFrames. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is expecting the `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it is evaluating to `True` and causing the test to fail. The root cause of the bug seems to be related to the comparison of block data within the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to compare the data within blocks properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare data within blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.values.equals(oblock.values):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By adding a comparison of the values within the blocks, the corrected version of the function should now correctly compare the DataFrames and output the expected result.

This fix should resolve the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".
