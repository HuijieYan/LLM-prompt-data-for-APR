To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to address the following issues:

1. The buggy function `equals` is not comparing the DataFrames correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
2. The `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function is not defined correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using a flawed approach, which leads to an incorrect comparison of DataFrames. This causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to produce the error message `AssertionError: assert True is False`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the approach used for comparing the blocks of the DataFrames in the `equals` function. We also need to define the `canonicalize` function correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function correctly
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output values will be satisfied.

The corrected version of the function addresses the incorrect comparison of DataFrames and defines the `canonicalize` function correctly to ensure a proper comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames.
