The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison of two dataframes. The function `equals` is used to compare two BlockManager objects representing DataFrames, and it fails to correctly identify when two dataframes are not equal. This is evident from the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` where two DataFrames are expected to be unequal, but the function mistakenly returns `True`.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of axes might not be performed correctly.
2. The sorting and comparison of blocks may not be done accurately.
3. The canonicalization of block order might not consider all relevant aspects.

The causes of the bug may include improperly comparing the axes of the two DataFrames and issues with comparing and sorting the blocks.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` function to ensure a correct comparison of DataFrames based on their axes and block contents. This can be done by debugging the comparison and sorting logic to ensure it correctly identifies when two DataFrames are not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        block = self_blocks[i]
        oblock = other_blocks[i]
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison of DataFrames is performed accurately and considers both axes and block contents. It should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
