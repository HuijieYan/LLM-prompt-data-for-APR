The bug in the equals function is causing it to return True when it should return False in the test_dataframe_not_equal test case. The bug lies in the comparison of the blocks in the two BlockManager instances.

The problem arises because the equals function attempts to canonicalize block order using a tuple of the type name and mgr_locs. However, the mgr_locs of the blocks are not compared correctly, causing equivalent blocks with different locations to be considered equal, resulting in a False comparison in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account their actual locations. This can be achieved by incorporating the location information when canoncalizing block order.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.copy())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the canonicalize function now makes a copy of the mgr_locs.as_array to ensure that the location information of the blocks is preserved during comparison. This will resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
