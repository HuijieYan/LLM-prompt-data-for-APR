The bug in the function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library is causing the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test to fail. The error message indicates that `assert True is False` failed, and the runtime input/output values and types of the variables inside the buggy function do not match the expected input/output values and types.

The bug appears to be in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to compare and sort blocks. It seems that the function isn't working as intended, causing the `equals` function to return an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to redefine the `canonicalize` function or make changes to the sorting process of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` tuples.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, pd.core.internals.blocks.NDArray):
            return (block.dtype, block.values.tostring())
        elif isinstance(block, pd.core.internals.blocks.ExtensionBlock):
            return (block.values.tostring(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By redefining the `canonicalize` function and changing the sorting process to use the values of the blocks, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
