The bug in the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False` for two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames. Specifically, when sorting the blocks with the `canonicalize` function, it's using the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attribute, which leads to incorrect comparisons. This results in the `equals` function returning `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix this bug, we can update the `canonicalize` function to use a tuple of the type name and the block values themselves to correctly compare the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and block values
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this updated `equals` function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, and the bug described in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
