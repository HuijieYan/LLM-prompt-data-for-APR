Based on the provided information, it is clear that the buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is causing the failing test in the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the bug is related to the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The issue seems to be caused by the `canonicalize` function, which is intended to order and compare blocks but is not doing so correctly.

To fix this bug, the canonicalize function needs to be revised to properly order the blocks for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.to_tuples())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now uses the type name of the block and its `mgr_locs` property to properly order and compare the blocks.

This correction should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function behave as expected, passing the failing test case.
