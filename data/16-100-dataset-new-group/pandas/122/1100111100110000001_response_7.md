The bug in the given function 'equals' is likely due to the comparison of dataframes 'df1' and 'df2'. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing with the message `assert True is False`. This suggests that the function is incorrectly identifying the two dataframes as equal, when they are not.

The buggy 'equals' function compares the axes of the two dataframes and their individual blocks. However, when comparing the blocks, the function sorts the blocks using a custom key function 'canonicalize'. This sorting is done to handle unconsolidated blocks such as Categorical, which can only be distinguished by the iteration order. However, the key function 'canonicalize' is defined inside the 'equals' function, which is unnecessary and causes the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, we should remove the redundant definition of the 'canonicalize' function and modify the sorting of blocks to handle unconsolidated blocks correctly. The correction is to remove the redundant 'canonicalize' definition and define it only once in the class 'BlockManager'. Then use the defined 'canonicalize' function to sort the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    # Define the canonicalize function for the class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # corrected equals function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # Sort blocks using the canonicalize function
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With the above correction, the 'equals' function should now work as expected and pass the given failing test.
