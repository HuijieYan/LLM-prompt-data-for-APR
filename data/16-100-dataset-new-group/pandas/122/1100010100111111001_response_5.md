The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return the wrong result, leading to a failing test. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` if they are equal and `False` if they are not. However, it is not handling the comparison correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the blocks contained within the `BlockManager` objects. It sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function based on the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but it is not comparing the actual blocks themselves.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to properly compare the blocks contained within the `BlockManager` objects, ensuring that they are indeed equal. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates over each block in `self.blocks` and compares it to the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. If any pair of blocks is not equal, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

By making this change, the corrected `equals` function should now return the correct result, resolving the failing test.
