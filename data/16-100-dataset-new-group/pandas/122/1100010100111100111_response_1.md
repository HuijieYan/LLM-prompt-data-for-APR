The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return True when it should be False in the failing test case mentioned. The bug is likely within the logic for comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames.

Specifically, the issue arises when the function compares `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The bug likely occurs when sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` inside the `canonicalize` function, as it may not accurately capture the equality of the blocks, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks more accurately. We can consider using a different approach to compare the blocks, such as comparing the values within the blocks directly. Additionally, we can also improve the sorting logic for the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare the values within the blocks directly
    self_values = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_values = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_val, other_val) for self_val, other_val in zip(self_values, other_values)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should accurately compare the blocks of the two DataFrames and return the expected result, passing the failing test.
