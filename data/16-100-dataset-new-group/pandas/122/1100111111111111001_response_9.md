The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. It looks like the comparison is not being done correctly, leading to the failing test case.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice: once outside the `BlockManager` class and once inside. This leads to confusion about which version is being used when sorting the blocks.

To fix the bug, we should remove the duplicate `canonicalize` function from the `BlockManager` class and make sure that the single `canonicalize` function is used in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define canonicalize outside the block manager class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly sort and compare the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists, passing the failing test case.
