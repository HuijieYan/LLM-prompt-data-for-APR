The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing because it is comparing the block order of two `BlockManager` instances. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their dtype and manager locations, but in the failing test, `df1` and `df2` have different dtypes, causing the sorted order to be different and leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, we should only sort and compare blocks that have the same dtype.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order for blocks with the same dtype
    def canonicalize(block):
        if block.dtype != other_blocks[self_blocks.index(block)].dtype:
            return block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        else:
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
