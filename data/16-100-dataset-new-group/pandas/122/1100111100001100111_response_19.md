## Bug Explanation
The `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations. This is due to the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which generates a tuple combining the block's type name and `mgr_locs`. The issue lies in the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, which is not effectively comparing the block locations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their location. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to simply use the block's content for comparison and then sort the blocks based on that.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on their content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the `canonicalize` function and sorts the blocks based on their content using a lambda function in the `sorted` method. This ensures that the blocks are compared based on their values rather than their location, resolving the bug.
