The buggy function compares two BlockManager instances for equality. At the end of the function, it iterates through the blocks of the two instances and checks for equality. However, the function has a nested `canonicalize` function which is also defined at the class level, causing a conflict between the two functions with the same name. This may lead to unexpected behavior and cause the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the nested `canonicalize` function should be renamed to avoid conflicts with the class-level one. Additionally, it's important to call the class-level `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method to ensure the correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Renamed nested canonicalize method to prevent conflict
    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
