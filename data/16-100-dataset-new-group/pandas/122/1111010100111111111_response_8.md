To fix the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, we need to address the issue where the function returns `True` when it should return `False` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This bug is causing the failing test to produce an `AssertionError` because the expected result is `False`, but the function is returning `True`.

The issue lies in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. Since the bug is causing the function to return `True` instead of `False`, the comparison logic must be incorrect. The comparison should consider the actual content of the blocks, rather than just their location.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the content of the blocks. We can achieve this by comparing the data within the blocks using the `values` attribute, which contains the actual data stored in the block, rather than comparing block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks by checking the actual values rather than locations
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the actual values within the blocks, we ensure that the `equals` function correctly determines whether the `BlockManager` instances are equal. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
