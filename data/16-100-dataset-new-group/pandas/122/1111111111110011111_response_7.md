## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. The comparison of the axes using the `equals` method.
3. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
4. The equality comparison of the sorted blocks.

## Cause of the bug
The bug occurs in the `equals` function because the comparison of the axes is not correctly handling the case of identical blocks with different locations.

The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with the same columns but in different orders. The `equals` function should return `False` in this case, but it incorrectly returns `True`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks needs to be adjusted to correctly handle cases where the same blocks have different locations. Additionally, any sorting or comparison logic needs to be updated in a way that properly handles the comparison of blocks with different locations.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer.tolist())  # Use indexer instead of as_array for consistency
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
The corrected version of the function addresses the issue by modifying the `canonicalize` function to use the `indexer` instead of `as_array` to properly handle cases where the same blocks have different locations. It also sorts the blocks based on this new `canonicalize` function, ensuring proper comparison and returning the correct result when checking for equality between the DataFrames.
