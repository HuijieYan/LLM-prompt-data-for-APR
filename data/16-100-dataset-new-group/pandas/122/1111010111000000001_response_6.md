The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two BlockManagers are equal. The `equals` function first compares the axes of the BlockManagers, then it consolidates the BlockManager inplace, sorts the blocks, and finally compares the blocks of the two BlockManagers.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Comparing axes of the BlockManagers
2. Consolidating the BlockManagers inplace
3. Sorting the blocks
4. Comparing the blocks of the two BlockManagers

The bug is likely caused by incorrectly comparing the axes of the BlockManagers and the mishandling of the data resulting from the consolidation or sorting operations.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the axes and blocks needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure that the equality check is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_consolidated = self.consolidate()
    other_consolidated = other.consolidate()
    
    if len(self_consolidated.blocks) != len(other_consolidated.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_consolidated.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_consolidated.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `consolidate` method is used to correctly consolidate the BlockManagers before comparing the blocks. This ensures that the comparison is performed on the correct data. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function is updated to properly handle the block sorting based on data type and manager locations.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
