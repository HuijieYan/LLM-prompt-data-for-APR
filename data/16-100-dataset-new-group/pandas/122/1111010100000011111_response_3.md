The bug in the `equals` function may cause the function to incorrectly return `True` for DataFrame objects with identical blocks but different locations. This can be due to the comparison not properly considering the block locations when sorting the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison in the `equals` function takes into account the block locations to properly detect differences.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # ... [other class methods]

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Sort blocks by type name and mgr_locs to account for different block locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block locations (mgr_locs) as a tuple to ensure proper sorting based on block type and locations. This addresses the issue where identical blocks with different locations were not properly detected as different, resulting in incorrect `equals` comparison results.
