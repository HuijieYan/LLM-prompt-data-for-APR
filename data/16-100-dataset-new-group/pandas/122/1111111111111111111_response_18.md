The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return `True` instead of the expected `False`. The issue on GitHub describes the problem with the `equals` method, indicating that it wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Analysis and Bug Cause
The bug is likely located in the comparison logic within the `equals` method. Even though the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` might be identical, they are not being correctly identified due to potential differences in their locations.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is designed to compare two dataframes, `df1` and `df2`, and assert that they are not equal. However, due to the bug in the `equals` method, the test is failing.

In the runtime values, the comparison logic is not correctly identifying that the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are similar. This is due to the failure to account for the potential difference in block locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to correctly account for the potential difference in block locations when comparing the blocks within `self` and `other`.

One way to achieve this is to update the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method to use the block's content as well as its location when generating the canonical representation. By sorting the blocks using this representation, we can ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version
Based on the bug analysis and the proposed fix strategy, here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Function to generate canonical representation for blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.equals(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    # Sort blocks using the canonical representation
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly identify whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal, accounting for potential differences in block locations. This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass as expected.
