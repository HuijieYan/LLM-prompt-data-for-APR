The bug in the `equals` function is likely causing it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames that have different block locations but contain identical blocks. This is likely because the comparison is not taking the block locations into account.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function should be modified to incorporate the block locations into the comparison of blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, `canonicalize` function returns a tuple combining the block type name and `mgr_locs` as a tuple. Then, when comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, we are using tuples and taking block locations into account. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the correct value for the failing test case.
