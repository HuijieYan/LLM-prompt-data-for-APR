The bug in the provided function `equals` can be identified as comparing the contents of two BlockManager objects `self` and `other`. The comparison relies on multiple checks and sorting the blocks, but the issue arises when comparing internal blocks and their order due to unconsolidated blocks like Categorical, which can result in wrong comparison results.

To fix this bug, we need to consolidate the internal blocks of `self` and `other` before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the internal blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly consolidate the internal blocks of `self` and `other` before performing the comparison, thereby addressing the bug.
