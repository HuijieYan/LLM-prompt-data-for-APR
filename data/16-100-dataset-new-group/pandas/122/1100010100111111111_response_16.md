The issue with the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The failing test demonstrates that the `equals` function returns `True` when it is expected to return `False`, indicating a bug in the comparison logic.

The likely cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, leading to incorrect results when checking for equality.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for blocks within the `BlockManager` objects needs to be thoroughly reviewed and potentially re-implemented to ensure correct equality detection.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks within the BlockManager objects
    for block_label, block in self.blocks.items():
        if block_label not in other.blocks:
            return False
        elif not block.equals(other.blocks[block_label]):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects are explicitly iterated over and compared. If any block does not have a matching label in the other `BlockManager` or if the blocks themselves are not equal, the function will return `False`. Otherwise, it will return `True` at the end of the comparison. This approach should address the bug and ensure correct equality detection.
