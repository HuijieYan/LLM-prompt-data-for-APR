The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the `blocks` between `self` and `other`. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, but it is not implemented correctly. The bug is likely caused by the sorting using `canonicalize` resulting in incorrect comparisons between `self` and `other`, leading to an incorrect `True` return.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to correctly produce a unique identifier for each block that can be used for comparison. This identifier should be based on the block's type name and its locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `canonicalize` function now correctly produces a unique identifier for each block based on its type name and locations. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function return the correct result when comparing blocks with different locations.
