The bug in the provided function is causing the assertion error because the comparison between the two dataframes, df1 and df2, using the equals method is returning True instead of False as expected.

The bug is likely happening due to an issue in the comparison logic and the way the function handles the dataframe blocks.

To fix this bug, I suggest reviewing the logic for comparing the blocks in the two dataframes and ensuring that their equality is correctly evaluated.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a function to compare the blocks for equality
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    # Compare the blocks in sorted order for both dataframes
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the comparison of the two DataFrames using the `equals` method should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
