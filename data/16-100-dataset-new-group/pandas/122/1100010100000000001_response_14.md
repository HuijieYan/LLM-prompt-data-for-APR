## Analysis:
The function compares two instances of a class and returns True if they are equal, and False otherwise. It first checks if the number of axes in both instances is the same. If not, it returns False. Then it checks if each axis is equal using the equals() method. After that, it consolidates the instances in place and compares the number of blocks in each instance. Finally, it sorts the blocks based on their type name and mgr_locs, and compares each block in the sorted lists to check for equality.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of self._consolidate_inplace() and other._consolidate_inplace() might cause unexpected behavior if these methods modify the instances in an unexpected way.
2. The sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function might not produce the desired order for comparison.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug could be caused by the unexpected behavior of the _consolidate_inplace() method or by the sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function not producing the correct order for comparison.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the implementation of the _consolidate_inplace() method to ensure it behaves as expected and does not cause unexpected changes to the instances.
2. Review the canonicalize function to ensure it correctly orders the blocks for comparison.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self_consolidated = self._consolidate()
    other_consolidated = other._consolidate()
    if len(self_consolidated.blocks) != len(other_consolidated.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self_consolidated.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other_consolidated.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. The _consolidate_inplace() method has been replaced with _consolidate() to avoid unexpected changes to the instances.
2. The sorting of blocks has been updated to use a lambda function directly within the sorted method, which should produce the correct order for comparison.
