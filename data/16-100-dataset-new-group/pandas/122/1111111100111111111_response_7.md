The issue arises from the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class, specifically the comparison of blocks within the function. The comparison of blocks is incorrectly returning `True` even when the blocks have different values. This is likely due to the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function, which is used to order the blocks for comparison based on their type name and locations.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to ensure that it accurately represents the nature of the blocks being compared. Additionally, it seems the function `canonicalize(block)` is defined twice, once inside the `BlockManager` class and once outside. This could lead to ambiguity and should be reviewed.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (repr(type(block)), block.values)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is modified to return a tuple containing the type of the block and its values, ensuring all relevant information is considered for ordering the blocks. This approach should address the incorrect comparison and return the expected result.

By employing this corrected version, the failing test case should now pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
