The buggy function `equals` has a bug that causes it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations. The bug is likely related to the canonicalization of block order using the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This results in incorrect comparison and invalidates the `equals` method.

To fix this bug, a strategy is to modify the `canonicalize` function to use a unique identifier for each block, such as its index or an ID, instead of just the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This will ensure that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block entries using internal block index
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._block_type, id(block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The modification made here is the usage of `block._block_type` and `id(block)` as the unique identifiers for comparison, ensuring that the blocks are compared based on their content rather than their locations. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` method return the correct result for the failing test case.
