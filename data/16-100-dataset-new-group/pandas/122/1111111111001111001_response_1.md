The buggy function is the `equals` method from the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library. The function is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The function fails to compare blocks properly, leading to incorrect results.

The potential error location is in the block comparison logic within the `equals` method, where the `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function does not handle multiple block types properly, and the comparison of blocks may be incorrect as a result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison and sorting logic in the `equals` method properly handles different block types and their dtype names.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the block type and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version ensures that the block comparison and sorting logic in the `equals` method handles different block types and their dtype names correctly. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` method function as expected.
