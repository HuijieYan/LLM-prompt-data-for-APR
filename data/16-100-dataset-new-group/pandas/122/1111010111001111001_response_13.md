The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library. It is intended to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. The function first compares the existing axes and then checks equality for each block within the `BlockManager`.

The potential error in the function lies in the comparison of the blocks. There is a discrepancy in the block comparison logic that is causing incorrect results when comparing blocks of different data types.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect comparison approach in the `equals` function. When comparing blocks, the function does not consider the data type of the blocks. This leads to incorrect results when blocks have different data types but contain the same values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to consider the data type of blocks when comparing them for equality. The comparison logic should take into account the block's data type along with its values to determine if the blocks are equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, a new `canonicalize` function has been introduced to generate a unique representation for each block by including its type. The `canonicalize` function generates a tuple consisting of the block's type and its `mgr_locs`. This unique representation is then used to compare blocks for equality, ensuring that the data type of the blocks is considered during comparison.

With this fix, the corrected `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
