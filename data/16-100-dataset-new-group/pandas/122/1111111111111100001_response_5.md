The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the logic used to compare `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

On comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the function `canonicalize` is used to sort the blocks, and it returns a tuple of the block's data type name and its location. However, the location is being retrieved incorrectly using `as_array.tolist()`, which is causing the sorting to be incorrect and leading to the wrong comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to fix the `canonicalize` function to properly retrieve the locations of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, id(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the `equals` function, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple containing the type of the block and its unique identifier (in this case, the block's memory address using `id(block)`). This will ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
