The buggy function `equals` is failing when comparing two DataFrames. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning True when it should be False.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function might be incorrect.
2. The comparison of the sorted blocks in the return statement might be flawed.

The cause of the bug is likely happening due to a misordering of blocks, which leads to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the sorting of the blocks needs to be revisited, ensuring that it is done correctly. Additionally, the comparison of the sorted blocks should be carefully examined to identify any potential issues.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function returns a tuple containing the string representation of the block type and the locations, which should ensure accurate sorting. Additionally, the comparison of the sorted blocks in the return statement remains the same.
