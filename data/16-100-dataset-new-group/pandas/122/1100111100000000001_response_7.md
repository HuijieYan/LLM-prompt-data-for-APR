The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. However, the bug lies in the way it is comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The bug is that the `canonicalize` function defined within the `equals` function is not correctly handling the sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly handles the sorting and comparison of the blocks. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function properly compares the type name and the manager locations of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a new canonicalize function to properly compare the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.to_numpy().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have defined a new `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function that properly compares the type name and the manager locations of the blocks. This ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly, fixing the bug in the original function.
