The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing blocks between two `BlockManager` instances, leading to incorrect results in the `DataFrame.equals()` method. 

The buggy function fails to correctly compare the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances, leading to a mismatch in the comparison result. This is evident from the failing test case where two DataFrames that are not equal are incorrectly evaluated as equal using the `equals` method.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function fails to handle the comparison of blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances correctly. This results in a mismatch while comparing the blocks and leads to an incorrect evaluation of equality between the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances are compared correctly. This can be done by updating the logic for comparing the blocks in the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
        
    return True
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances is done using a loop to iterate through each block and ensure their equality.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `equals` method correctly compares the `BlockManager` instances, fixing the previously failing test case.
