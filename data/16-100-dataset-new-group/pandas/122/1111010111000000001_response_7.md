### Analysis:
The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to check for equality. It first compares the axes and then consolidates and compares the internal data blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different data types in columns `a` and `b`, and verifies that `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`, as expected.

### Error locations:
1. The comparison logic in the `equals` method may not handle cases where the data types in the blocks are different but still represent the same data.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `equals` method likely arises from the comparison of blocks with different data types but representing the same data, leading to false negatives in the comparison.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic to compare the actual data within the blocks rather than relying solely on the data types.

### Corrected version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block based on the data content
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the comparison now directly compares the data within the blocks using the `equals` method for the block values. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data content rather than just the data types.
