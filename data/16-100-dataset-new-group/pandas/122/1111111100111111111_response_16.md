The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` in the failing test. 

The bug likely arises when comparing the blocks, as the function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization, and then compares each pair of sorted blocks for equality. This process is flawed resulting in the incorrect outcome.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. Specifically, we need to handle the comparison of the blocks and their ordering in a way that accurately represents their equality. 

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort and compare blocks based on type and elements
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.values.to_list()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.values.to_list()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, the blocks are sorted using the combination of the `dtype.name` and the elements in the block represented as a list. Then, the comparison of blocks is done using the `equals` method, ensuring that the equality comparison accurately represents the block contents.

This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and should result in the `equals` function returning `False` as expected in the failing test.
