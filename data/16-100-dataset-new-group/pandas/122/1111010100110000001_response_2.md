The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas module. The function is used to check the equality of two BlockManager objects. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the given input dataframes `df1` and `df2`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of axes may not be handling the data type difference properly
2. The sorting and comparison of blocks may not be considering all relevant factors

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not properly handling the comparison of data blocks with different data types. This is evident from the error message, which shows that the method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `equals` method to handle the data type comparison more effectively and ensure that the sorting and comparison of data blocks takes all relevant factors into account.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort the blocks based on data type and values
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), block.values.to_list()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), block.values.to_list()))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we first check the length and equality of axes. Then, we consolidate the data and compare the length of blocks. Finally, we sort the blocks based on data type and values before comparing them.

This corrected version should handle the comparison of BlockManager objects more effectively and address the bug that caused the failing test.
