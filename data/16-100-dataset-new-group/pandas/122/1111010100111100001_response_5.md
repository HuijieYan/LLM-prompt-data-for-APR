The bug in the `equals` function is likely causing the function to return `True` when it should be returning `False`, as indicated by the failing test. The function appears to be comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects, and the bug seems to be related to how it handles the comparison.

One potential cause of the bug could be how the function is sorting and comparing the blocks, as well as the condition for returning `False` if the number of blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects is not equal.

To fix the bug, we should carefully compare and sort the blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects, ensuring that their order and contents are properly compared and any mismatches are detected and returned.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare and sort the blocks in the two BlockManager objects
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.values))
    
    # Ensure that the sorted blocks are compared for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should properly compare and sort the blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects, addressing the potential causes of the bug and fixing the failing test case.
