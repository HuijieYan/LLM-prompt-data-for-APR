The buggy function `equals` in the class `BlockManager` is incorrectly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This issue is causing the failed test as posted on GitHub. The main cause of this issue is that the function does not correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly handle blocks with different locations and ensure that it returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort and compare the blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.index))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.index))
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.index.equals(oblock.index)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first consolidate the internal data structures of both `self` and `other`. Then, we compare the number of blocks and sort them based on their values and index. Finally, we iterate through the sorted blocks and compare their values and indices using the `equals` method to ensure that the blocks are identical.

This corrected version should fix the bug and make the `equals` function return the expected result, as described in the GitHub issue.
