#### Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is comparing DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method, and the assertion is failing because it is returning `True` instead of `False`. This is a known issue on GitHub, where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The cause of this bug is that the `equals` method doesn't correctly handle sorting and comparing the blocks within the DataFrames.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the sorting and comparison of the blocks.
2. Update the `equals` method to utilize the modified `canonicalize` function for sorting and comparing the blocks.

#### The Corrected Version

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Modified canonicalize function
        def canonicalize(blocks):
            return tuple(sorted(
                (block.values, block.index, block.dtypes.name, tuple(block.columns))
                for block in blocks
            ))

        self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
        other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)
        return self_blocks == other_blocks
```
