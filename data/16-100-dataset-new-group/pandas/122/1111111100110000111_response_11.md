### Analysis:

The buggy code is in the `BlockManager` class and the `equals` method within this class is not returning the expected output. The related functions for `equals` within the same class are `as_array` and `_consolidate_inplace`, and the related error message is `assert True is False`. 

Upon analyzing the GitHub issue, it is clear that the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Potential error locations:

1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` may return an unexpected result.
2. The sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` may not be correct.

### Cause of the bug:

The bug behavior is caused by `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class, which is wrongly identifying the difference in the blocks. The issue arises when comparing blocks with different locations but identical content.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. The `equals` method should be modified to properly identify the blocks with identical content but different location as not-equal.
2. Proper checks and comparisons should be made for `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `self_blocks`, and `other_blocks` to handle the different locations of identical blocks.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        not block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version includes a change in the last return statement to negate the result of the `equals` method for each block comparison. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are correctly identified as not-equal. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
