To fix the buggy function, we need to focus on the incorrect comparison of DataFrame objects. The reason for the failure is that the buggy function `equals` does not correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames.

The issue can be fixed by modifying the comparison logic within the `equals` function to compare the data within blocks rather than the blocks themselves. We also need to ensure that the axes and blocks are appropriately consolidated and converted to a canonical form so that they can be compared accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_cons = self._consolidate_inplace()
    other_cons = other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self._rebuild_blknos_and_blklocs()
    other_blocks = other._rebuild_blknos_and_blklocs()
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    self_canonical_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_canonical_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_canonical_blocks, other_canonical_blocks)
    )
```

By making these changes, the `equals` function will now correctly compare the data within blocks and return the expected result.

The corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
