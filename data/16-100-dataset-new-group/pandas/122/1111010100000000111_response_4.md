The buggy function 'equals' is causing the DataFrame.equals() method to return True in cases of identical blocks with different locations, instead of the expected False. The issue arises from the fact that when comparing the blocks, their locations are not being taken into consideration.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the 'equals' function to consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them. This can be achieved by incorporating the block locations into the comparison process.

Here is the corrected version of the 'equals' function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare block locations as well
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a comparison of the block locations within the 'all' function, ensuring that the block locations are also compared along with the block values. This modification will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, and the DataFrame.equals() method should now return the expected result of False when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
