Based on the input parameters, the failing test, and the runtime variable values, it seems that the equals function is not correctly comparing the blocks of the BlockManager. It is sorting and comparing the blocks incorrectly, leading to a false comparison when two DataFrame objects are actually not equal.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly. This may involve checking the order in which the blocks are sorted and ensuring that the comparison is accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks

        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
            if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
                return False
                
        return True
```

This corrected version compares the blocks directly without sorting, ensuring an accurate comparison. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
