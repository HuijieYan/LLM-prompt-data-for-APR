## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects, even though they have identical blocks with different locations. This can be seen from the GitHub issue where the user expected the `equals` function to return `False` for the given test case, but it incorrectly returned `True`. 

The bug arises from the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks using a `canonicalize` method to compare them, but it does not take into account the different placements of the blocks. This leads to incorrect comparison results.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should consider their content and the locations of the blocks. The `canonicalize` function should take the block content and the locations (mgr_locs) into account to produce a unique representation for each block. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations will be treated as distinct blocks during comparison.

## Corrected Code
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name, block content, and mgr_locs to account for block locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now considers block content (values) and block locations (mgr_locs) to produce a unique representation for each block. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations will be treated as distinct blocks during comparison, fixing the bug.
