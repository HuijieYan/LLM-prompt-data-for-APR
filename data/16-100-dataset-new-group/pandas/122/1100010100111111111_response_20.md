The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames, even if they contain identical blocks with different locations. This issue was reported in a GitHub post titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" and provides a code sample that fails in the `equals` method.

Upon analyzing the provided code for the `equals` function and the error message from the failing test, it appears that the issue stems from the comparison of the blocks' locations.

The cause of the bug lies in the `canonicalize` function, which aims to standardize the order of blocks based on their type name and locations. However, if there are identical blocks with different locations, this approach fails to distinguish them, leading to an incorrect comparison.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the sorting logic in the `canonicalize` function to not only consider the type name but also the block content. This modification would ensure that identical blocks with different locations are handled correctly during the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, content, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now correctly handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
