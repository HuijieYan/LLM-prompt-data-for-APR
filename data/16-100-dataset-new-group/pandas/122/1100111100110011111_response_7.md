The issue with the buggy function is that it wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is causing the failing test, as it expects the function to return False.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparison of self_axes and other_axes, the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks, and the logic to determine if the two dataframes are equal.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the comparison of blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for comparing the blocks and handling the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # create a function to compare the blocks
    def compare_blocks(block, oblock):
        return (block.values == oblock.values).all()  # compare the values of the blocks
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda oblock: oblock.values.tostring())
    
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function handles the comparison of blocks with different locations by directly comparing their values. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the expected value of False for the failing test.
