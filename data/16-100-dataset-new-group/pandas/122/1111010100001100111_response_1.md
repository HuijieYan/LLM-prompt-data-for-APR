The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class appears to be related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `equals` method. The error is likely due to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, leading to a faulty return value.

The `canonicalize` function seems to be attempting to standardize the blocks' order, but it may be failing to correctly handle blocks with the same content but different locations.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their locations.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the content of the blocks using `np.array_equal` instead of comparing the blocks directly with their locations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected output.
