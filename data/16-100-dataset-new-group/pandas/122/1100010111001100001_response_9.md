The bug in the `equals` function is that it assumes the blocks in `self` and `other` are sorted and consolidated, which may not be the case. This can lead to the `equals` method giving incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both `self` and `other` are consolidated and sorted before comparing their axes and blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By consolidating and sorting `self` and `other` before comparing their axes and blocks, we ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result for the failing test case.
