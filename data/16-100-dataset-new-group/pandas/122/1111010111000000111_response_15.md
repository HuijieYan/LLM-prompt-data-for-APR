Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the DataFrame.equals() method wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations. The failing test function 'test_dataframe_not_equal' is a copy-pastable example from the failing test file located in pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py. The failing test is expected to return False, but it currently fails.

The issue is summarized in the following steps:

1. The DataFrame.equals() method is expected to return False when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
2. However, the equals() method is currently returning True in this case, indicating a bug in the implementation.
3. The bug is confirmed by the failing test function 'test_dataframe_not_equal', where it asserts that df1.equals(df2) should return False, but it actually returns True.

The buggy code provided is from the PandasObject class in the file pandas/core/internals/managers.py. The buggy function 'equals' is part of the BlockManager class. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the internal data structure.

The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the 'equals' method, which fails to account for the locations of identical blocks when comparing two DataFrames.

To fix this bug, one potential strategy is to modify the 'canonicalize' function used for sorting the blocks. Instead of using only the block's dtype and mgr_locs, it should also consider the locations of the blocks. Additionally, the comparison between the two DataFrames in the return statement should account for the block locations.

Here is a corrected version of the 'equals' function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the 'canonicalize' function now includes the block's values in the tuple, and the comparison between the DataFrames considers the block locations and values. This should resolve the bug and make the 'equals' method work as expected.
