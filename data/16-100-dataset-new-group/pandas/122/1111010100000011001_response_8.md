Based on the information provided, the buggy function `equals` is used to compare the `BlockManager` objects. The function compares the attributes `self.axes`, `self.blocks` of one `BlockManager` object with the corresponding attributes of another `BlockManager` object. The function should return `True` if all the conditions are satisfied, and `False` otherwise.

The potential error locations in the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect comparison of `len(self.blocks)` and `len(other.blocks)`
2. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of each block
3. Missing definitions and comparisons for some variables like `block`, `block.dtype`, and `block.mgr_locs`

The cause of the bug seems to be that the function is not properly comparing the `blocks` attribute of the `BlockManager` objects.

To fix the bug, the function should properly compare the `blocks` attribute using the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of each block. Additionally, the function should take into consideration the individual block comparisons and return `False` if any block does not match.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of each block. It also has a more accurate comparison for the `mgr_locs` attribute. This should fix the bug and ensure that the comparison of `BlockManager` objects produces the expected output.
