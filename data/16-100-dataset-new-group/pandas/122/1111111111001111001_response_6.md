The bug appears to be in the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks in the `BlockManager` instance, but the `canonicalize` function is not defined correctly. The correct definition of the `canonicalize` function should take `block` as a parameter, as it is intended to operate on individual blocks within the `BlockManager` class.

The corrected version of the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class should be as follows:

```python
def canonicalize(self, block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly operate on the individual blocks within the `BlockManager` class and return the expected output.

Here is the corrected version of the revised buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass.
