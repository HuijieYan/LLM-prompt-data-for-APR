The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of the blocks of the `self` and `other` BlockManager objects. Here's an explanation of the bug and a strategy for fixing it:

### Bug Description
In the `equals` function, the bug occurs when comparing the blocks of `self` and `other`. The comparison is not correctly accounting for unconsolidated blocks, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison includes proper handling for unconsolidated blocks and is based on the correct criteria for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        # Consolidate inplace
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Canonicalize block order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.max(), block.values.nbytes)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
In this corrected version, we have added logic to properly handle unconsolidated blocks and to compare blocks based on their type, location, and values' byte size.

By using this corrected version, the failing test should now pass, and the `equals` function should return the expected `False` value for the given test case in the GitHub issue.
