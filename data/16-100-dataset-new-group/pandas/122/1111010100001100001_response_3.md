The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. It first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects, then consolidates the blocks of each `BlockManager` and finally compares the blocks to check if they are equal.

The bug appears to be in the comparison of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks by a canonicalized key before performing the comparison, but the key is not being derived correctly.

Based on the runtime input/output variable values, it seems that the bug is occurring when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects, as the `canonicalize` function does not produce the correct key for comparison.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be implemented in a way that it correctly produces the key for comparison. One possible approach could be to use a combination of the block's data type and its location to create the key for comparison.

A corrected version of the function may look like this:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function creates a tuple that combines the type of the block and its location, which provides a unique key for sorting and comparison.
