## Correction:

The bug in the `equals` function occurs due to the order of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` being compared. The original code does not account for the possibility of unconsolidated blocks, such as Categorical data, which may have different locations but still represent the same data.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's data type and any additional information necessary to distinguish unconsolidated blocks. Then, we need to sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using this modified canonicalize function before comparing them in the `all` statement.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function now properly handles unconsolidated blocks or blocks with different locations but representing the same data, and it should pass the failing test case.
