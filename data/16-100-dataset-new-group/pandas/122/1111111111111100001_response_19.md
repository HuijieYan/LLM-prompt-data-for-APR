The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of the block elements. The comparison of blocks is not being correctly conducted, which leads to the function returning a false assertion even when the dataframes are not equal.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is handled accurately. One way to do this is by comparing the block data directly to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    return True
```

By comparing the blocks directly, we ensure an accurate assessment of the equality of the dataframes. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
