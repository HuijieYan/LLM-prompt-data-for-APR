The bug in the provided function is likely due to the way it compares the blocks of the `self` and `other` objects. It sorts the blocks and then compares them using the `equals` method. However, the sorting key used in the `canonicalize` function is not correctly generating unique identifiers for the blocks.

The reason why the bug occurs is that the `canonicalize` function is not defined correctly in the `equals` method. The `canonicalize` function should take into account both the type name and `mgr_locs` of each block. This is essential to guarantee that different blocks are correctly distinguished when comparing the `self` and `other` objects.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to take both the type name and `mgr_locs` of each block into account when generating the sorting key.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function generates a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs` of each block as the sorting key. This ensures that different blocks are correctly distinguished when comparing the `self` and `other` objects.
