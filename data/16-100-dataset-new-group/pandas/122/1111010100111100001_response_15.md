The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances `self` and `other` to check if they are equal. The function is comparing the axes and blocks of `self` and `other`, and then canonicalizing and sorting the blocks before comparing each pair.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to an assertion error.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables within the function, it is clear that the comparison logic is incorrect. The axes are being compared correctly, but the comparison of blocks is flawed. The canonicalization and sorting of the blocks are not resulting in correct comparisons due to mismatched data.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization and sorting process should ensure that the block content is accurately compared.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare axes
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        # Ensure that the blocks have the same shape and content
        if (block1.shape != block2.shape) or not np.array_equal(block1.values, block2.values):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of blocks directly checks their shape and content, ensuring that they are equal. This approach directly compares the blocks' values, which is a more accurate way to determine if the `BlockManager` instances are equal.
