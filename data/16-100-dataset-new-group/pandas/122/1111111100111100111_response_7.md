## Fixing the Bug

### Cause of the Bug
The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly, even when the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal. This is because the `equals` function does not account for the possibility that identical blocks may have different locations.

- The self and other axes are the same, but the blocks within self and other are sorted based on their Type and Location (mgr_locs) when determining if two DataFrames are equal. However, when comparing self and other, the function did not ensure that the blocks are sorted in the same way.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should ensure that identical blocks are sorted in the same way for self and other. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider both type name and `mgr_locs` for sorting blocks.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function inside the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().__array_interface__['typestr'], block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly account for the sorting of identical blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, thereby resolving the issue and passing the failing test on GitHub.
