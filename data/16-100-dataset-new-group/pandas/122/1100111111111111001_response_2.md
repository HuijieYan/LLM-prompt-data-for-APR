The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This function is used to compare two BlockManager objects, but it contains a bug that causes incorrect comparison results.

The bug seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks by their type and manager locations, but it may not be interpreting the data correctly.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two DataFrames are equal, and it currently fails with an assertion error:
`E       assert True is False`

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the sorting and comparison based on block type and manager locations is performed correctly. The `canonicalize` function and the subsequent comparison using `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` need to accurately reflect the characteristics and content of the blocks for a proper comparison. 

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sorting the blocks for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the fixed version of the `equals` function, the `canonicalize` function now correctly returns a tuple with the string representations of the block's dtype and mgr_locs. This ensures that the comparison is based on the correct characteristics of the blocks.

The `equals` function has been updated to use the correctly sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` for comparison, and it should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
