The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

One potential error location is the `canonicalize` function, where it uses `mgr_locs.as_array` without belonging to the block. This results in an attribute error when trying to access the attribute `as_array` of the `mgr_locs` object.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect use of the `canonicalize` function, which leads to an incorrect comparison of blocks between the two DataFrames. This causes the `equals` function to return `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we should refactor the `canonicalize` function to properly access the `mgr_locs` attribute from the `block` object. Once this is fixed, the comparison between blocks in the two DataFrames should be correct, and the `equals` function should behave as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Refactored canonicalize function to access block's mgr_locs attribute
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly handle the comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames and return the expected result, resolving the issue raised on GitHub.
