The buggy function is the 'equals' method within the 'BlockManager' class, located in the 'pandas/core/internals/managers.py' file.

The buggy function is intended to compare two instances of 'BlockManager' for equality. The main issue with the function is that it is incorrectly comparing 'IntBlock' and 'ObjectBlock' elements within the 'BlockManager'. It incorrectly assumes that the block ordering will match between the two 'BlockManager' instances.

The main strategy for fixing the bug is to implement a proper comparison method for the 'BlockManager' class, which takes into account the block ordering as well as the equality comparison for 'IntBlock' and 'ObjectBlock' elements.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = {type(block).__name__: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {type(block).__name__: block for block in other.blocks}

    if self_blocks.keys() != other_blocks.keys():
        return False

    for block_type in self_blocks.keys():
        if not self_blocks[block_type].equals(other_blocks[block_type]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version first ensures that the number and types of blocks in the two 'BlockManager' instances match, and then iterates through the block types to compare the individual blocks. This approach accounts for the different block types (e.g. 'IntBlock', 'ObjectBlock') that may be present in the 'BlockManager' instances and ensures that each block is compared correctly. This should address the issues identified with the original buggy function.
