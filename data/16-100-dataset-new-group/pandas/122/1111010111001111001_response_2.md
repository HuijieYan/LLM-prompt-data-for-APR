The bug in the equals function is likely causing the failing test because it compares two BlockManager instances and their blocks. The equals function returns False if the lengths of the self_axes and other_axes are not equal, and then it checks the blocks by canonicalizing them using the dtype name and mgr_locs. The issue might arise from incorrect sorting or comparison of blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to analyze the canonicalization process, sorting, and comparison of blocks in the equals function and correct any errors. Additionally, we need to ensure that the comparison logic handles the blocks correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
In the fixed version, we replaced block.dtype.name with str(block.dtype) to ensure that dtype comparison works correctly. We also included block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() in the tuple to capture block locations accurately. This updated canonicalize function should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test passes.
