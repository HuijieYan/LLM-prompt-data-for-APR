The cause of the bug is an error in the sorting and comparison of the blocks while checking for equality. The error arises from not properly handling the dtype and mgr_locs attributes when canonicalizing the blocks for comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we properly handle the dtype and mgr_locs attributes when canonicalizing the blocks for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs, block._consolidate())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use the type of the block, the mgr_locs, and the consolidated version of the block as the canonicalization key. This ensures that all relevant attributes are considered when comparing the blocks for equality.
