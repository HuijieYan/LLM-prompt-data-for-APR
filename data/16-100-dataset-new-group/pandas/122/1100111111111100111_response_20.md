To fix the buggy function, we need to address the logic that is causing the incorrect return value. Based on the provided runtime values and types, and the failing test, we have identified a potential issue in the canonicalize function, which is used for sorting the blocks. The current implementation of the canonicalize function does not correctly handle different locations of identical blocks.

Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the canonicalize function to account for the locations of identical blocks. We can do this by including the block's location information in the tuple returned by the canonicalize function.
2. Update the sorting process to consider the type name and the block's location when sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to include block location information
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the equals function should now handle the sorting of blocks based on both the type name and the block's location, ensuring that it accurately compares the two BlockManagers.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and make the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
