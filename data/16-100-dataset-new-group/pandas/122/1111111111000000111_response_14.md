### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas` library is erroneously returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This behavior has been identified as a bug in the GitHub issue.

### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` could be causing the bug.
2. Sorting and comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using `canonicalize` function might be causing the bug.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. When two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations, the function wrongly returns True.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function correctly handles the scenario of identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Checking if each block in self equals the corresponding block in other
    for i in range(len(self_sorted_blocks)):
        if not self_sorted_blocks[i].equals(other_sorted_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
``` 

This corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that it properly handles the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, as well as ensuring that the lengths of the blocks in both DataFrames are the same before performing the comparison. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
