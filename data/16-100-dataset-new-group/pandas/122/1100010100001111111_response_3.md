Based on the analysis of the GitHub issue and the provided buggy function, the bug seems to be related to the `equals` function incorrectly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the `canonicalize` function, where the sorting of the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs is causing the comparison to fail.

The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs. This leads to the comparison returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the sorting based on mgr_locs should be removed from the `canonicalize` function to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal. The sorting should only be based on dtype name to maintain the expected comparison behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been modified to only sort the blocks based on dtype name, removing the sorting based on mgr_locs. This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
