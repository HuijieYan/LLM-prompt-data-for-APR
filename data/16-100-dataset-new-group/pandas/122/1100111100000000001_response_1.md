The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` and returns True if they are equal and False if they are not.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The call to `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` may cause modification of the original BlockManager objects, affecting their equality comparison.
2. The use of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function may not be correctly comparing the blocks in the `BlockManager`.

The cause of the bug could be that the `_consolidate_inplace` function modifies the original BlockManager objects, leading to incorrect equality comparison. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function may not correctly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager`.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to create a copy of the BlockManager objects before calling `_consolidate_inplace` and to carefully review the `canonicalize` function to ensure it correctly compares the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_copy = self.copy()
    other_copy = other.copy()
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self_copy.axes, other_copy.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self_copy.blocks) != len(other_copy.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_copy.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_copy.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we make copies of the `self` and `other` BlockManager objects and perform the comparison on the copies, thus avoiding modification of the original objects. We also utilize the `canonicalize` function for comparison, assuming it has been correctly implemented to compare the blocks in the `BlockManager`.
