The bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class is leading to the failure of the test_dataframe_not_equal test. The equals method is used to check if two BlockManager instances are equal. However, the current implementation fails to do so due to an issue with the sorting of the blocks.

The issue arises from the way the canonicalize function is used to sort the blocks. The dtype.name and mgr_locs are used to create a tuple for sorting, but this approach does not guarantee that the blocks will be sorted in a consistent and reliable manner.

To fix this bug, a better approach for sorting the blocks needs to be implemented. One possible strategy is to use the index of the blocks instead of dtype.name and mgr_locs for sorting, as the index provides a consistent and stable way to order the blocks.

Below is the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: list(self.blocks).index(x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: list(other.blocks).index(x))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the equals method uses the index of the blocks to sort them, ensuring a consistent and reliable ordering of the blocks for comparison. This approach addresses the bug and should make the function pass the failing test.
