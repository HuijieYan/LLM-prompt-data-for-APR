Based on the GitHub issue and the runtime values and types of the input parameters and relevant variables, it appears that the bug in the `equals` function is related to the comparison of blocks with different locations.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle consolidated blocks with identical data but different locations. This results in the `equals` function incorrectly returning True for dataframes with blocks in different order or with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the comparison takes into account the data and the locations of the blocks. One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include locations of the blocks when sorting them. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account the block order and locations while checking for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))  # Include locations when sorting

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `equals` function should now properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations and return the correct result, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
