The bug seems to be in the canonicalize function, which is being redefined within the buggy equals function. This can lead to confusion as to which canonicalize function is being referred to when it's called, possibly causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the redundant canonicalize function within the buggy equals function should be removed. Then, the canonicalize function from the BlockManager class can be called directly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=BlockManager.canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=BlockManager.canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
