The bug in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks based on their data types and locations. The `canonicalize` function uses the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attribute, which doesn't exist and should be `mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()`. This results in an incorrect canonicalization, leading to the wrong comparison of DataFrame blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to provide the correct canonicalization of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
        
    # corrected canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now accurately compare the DataFrames while taking block locations into account. This change addresses the issue posted on the GitHub bug report and resolves the failing test case mentioned.
