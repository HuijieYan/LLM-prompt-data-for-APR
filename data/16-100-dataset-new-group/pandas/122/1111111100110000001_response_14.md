The bug in the equals function is causing the failing test. The equals function is supposed to check if two BlockManager objects are equal, but it is not comparing the values of the blocks correctly.

The bug seems to be in the canonicalization of blocks. The canonicalize function is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs, but the implementation of this function is incorrect.

Instead of fixing the canonicalize function, a better strategy would be to directly compare the values of the blocks and avoid the need for sorting them.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_dict = {self_blocks[i].mgr_locs: self_blocks[i] for i in range(len(self_blocks))}
    other_blocks_dict = {other_blocks[i].mgr_locs: other_blocks[i] for i in range(len(other_blocks))}
    if len(self_blocks_dict) != len(other_blocks_dict):
        return False

    for loc, block in self_blocks_dict.items():
        if loc in other_blocks_dict:
            if not block.equals(other_blocks_dict[loc]):
                return False
        else:
            return False

    return True
```

This version of the function directly compares the values of the blocks using a dictionary to store the mgr_locs and their corresponding blocks. This approach ensures that all blocks are checked for equality and the function correctly returns True or False based on the comparison.
