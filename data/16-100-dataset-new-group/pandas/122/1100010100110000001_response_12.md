The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test is failing. It shows that the assertion `True is False` failed, and it contains a comparison between two DataFrames with different data.

The bug seems to be related to comparing the DataFrames using the `.equals()` method, which is giving a `True` result even when the DataFrames have different values.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` function to explicitly return `False` when the data in the DataFrames is different.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # New check for data comparison
    if any(not block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        return False
    return True
```

With this correction, the `.equals()` method will explicitly check the data within the blocks and return `False` if they are different. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
