The bug in the equals function of the BlockManager class seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks. The function seems to be returning False because the comparison of the blocks is not producing the expected results. Looking at the provided runtime values and types, it appears that the blocks are not being compared correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done properly. We can use the canonicalize function to sort the blocks and then compare them using the equals method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the fixed version, the canonicalize function sorts the blocks based on the type name and mgr_locs. Then, the sorted blocks are compared using the equals method.

This should address the bug and ensure that the function returns the correct result.
