The bug in the equals function arises from the incorrect comparison of two dataframes using the df1.equals(df2) method. The function returns True when it should return False. This bug is due to the way the function compares blocks within the dataframes and does not account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the equals function to properly compare the blocks within the dataframes and take into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks to ensure proper comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort and compare the blocks, handling different block locations
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    self_blocks.sort()
    other_blocks.sort()

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the equals function now properly compares the dataframes and accounts for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
