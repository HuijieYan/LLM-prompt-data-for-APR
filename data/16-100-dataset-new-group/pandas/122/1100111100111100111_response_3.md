The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by a sorting issue within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists before the `equals` comparison. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be `False`, and the GitHub issue confirms that the expected output is `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is consistent and correct. This can be achieved by using the same `canonicalize` function to sort both lists and compare the sorted blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should provide the expected output of `False` for the failing test case provided in the GitHub issue.
