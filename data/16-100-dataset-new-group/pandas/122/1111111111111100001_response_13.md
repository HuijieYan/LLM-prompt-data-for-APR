The buggy function `equals` from the class `BlockManager` in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` contains a bug that causes it to fail the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`. The error message from the failing test indicates that `assert True is False` is raised when calling `assert df1.equals(df2) is False`.

The runtime values and types of the input parameters and relevant variables at the function's return have been analyzed. The issue lies in the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The two tuples of blocks are not being sorted correctly, leading to the failure in the equality check.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to handle the case when `block` is an `ObjectBlock`. Additionally, the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` need to be correctly sorted and compared.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            return (block.values.to_numpy().tolist())
        else:
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making these modifications, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
