The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The error message indicates that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

The cause of the bug is likely that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. This is leading to an incorrect result and an assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables is working correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are using a more comprehensive approach to comparing the blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. We are sorting the blocks by combining their `mgr_locs` and `values`, and then comparing them using the `equals` method. This should ensure that the comparison is done correctly and the function returns the expected results.
