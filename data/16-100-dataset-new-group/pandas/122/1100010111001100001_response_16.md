The bug in the equals function seems to be causing the failing test because it is not correctly comparing the dataframes df1 and df2. The equals function compares the axes and blocks of two BlockManager objects. However, due to the wrong order of values within the blocks, the comparison fails.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the order of values within the blocks is consistent and correct before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = [block.get_values() for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block.get_values() for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we extract the values from each block using the get_values() method and then compare the values within the blocks to determine if the two BlockManagers are equal. This should ensure that the comparison is done correctly and the failing test should pass.
