The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return an unexpected assertion error. The function compares two DataFrames and returns `True` when they are equal and `False` otherwise. However, in this case, the comparison is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`, causing the test to fail.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are in the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison is not working as expected, leading to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is related to the sorting and comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The bug may be due to how the `equals` method is implemented for the individual blocks, or there might be an issue with how the blocks are being compared using the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, we can implement a custom comparison method for the blocks or use a different approach to compare the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to ensure that the comparison returns the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare individual blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we loop through each block in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and explicitly compare them using the `equals` method. This approach ensures that each block is compared accurately, addressing the potential issue with the previous implementation.
