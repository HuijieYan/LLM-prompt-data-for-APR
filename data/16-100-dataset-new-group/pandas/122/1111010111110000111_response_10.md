The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing two DataFrames, causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail with the error `assert True is False`.

The bug is caused by the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class not correctly comparing the internal blocks of the DataFrames. The issue on GitHub titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" confirms that the `equals` function is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to iterate through each block in the DataFrames and compare them individually, ensuring that any differences are correctly identified and that the correct boolean value is returned.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare each block in the DataFrames
        for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
            if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
                return False
        
        return True
```

With this corrected `equals` function, the DataFrames will be correctly compared, and the failing test should now pass without any errors.
