The bug in the given function is causing the test to fail because it is incorrectly comparing the dataframes. Specifically, the bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method attempts to compare two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed, resulting in incorrect results.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists, where each block is sorted and compared. The bug also involves the `canonicalize` function that is used to define the sorting key for the blocks.

The incorrect comparison is leading to a `True is False` assertion error when the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` statement is executed, as the actual comparison result is not as expected.

To fix this bug, we should revise the comparison logic and the `canonicalize` function to correctly compare the blocks' content. This may involve ensuring that the blocks are sorted and compared based on their actual content, not just the type name and location.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Comparing the blocks based on their actual content
    def compare_blocks(block, oblock):
        return block.values.equals(oblock.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())
    
    return all(compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we are sorting the blocks based on their actual content rather than their type name and location. We also define a new `compare_blocks` function to compare the blocks' values.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
