The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` incorrectly for dataframes with identical blocks in different locations. This is verified by the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`, which checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False` for two dataframes with the same data in different column order. 

The bug is likely located within the `equals` function, specifically in the block sorting logic that leads to incorrect comparison between the blocks of the two dataframes.

To fix the bug, the sorting logic for the blocks needs to be adjusted to correctly compare and identify the differences between the blocks in the two dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining block values and block location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.astype(str), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
