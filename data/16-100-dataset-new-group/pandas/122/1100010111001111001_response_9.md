The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing two DataFrames in the expected manner. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are equal and then checks if all the corresponding axes are equal. However, it does not consider the case when the axes are in a different order. Additionally, it does not take into account the order of the blocks within the DataFrame.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not appropriately handle the comparison of DataFrames with the same data but in a different order. The comparison depends on the order of the blocks, which can lead to a false negative when comparing DataFrames that are essentially the same but in different orders.

To fix the bug, the function should first sort the blocks based on the canonicalize function and then compare them.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compare DataFrames regardless of the order of the blocks within them. It should now pass the failing test provided.
