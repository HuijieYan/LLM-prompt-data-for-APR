* It seems that the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class is not working correctly, as evidenced by the failing test.

* The bug appears to be in the `equals` method where it checks if the two DataFrames are equal. The function sorts the blocks in the DataFrames and then compares them, but it does not properly handle the case where the values in the blocks are not the same.

* To fix the bug, the `equals` method should iterate over the blocks and compare the values within each block, rather than just comparing the blocks themselves.

* Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This version of the `equals` method iterates over the blocks in the DataFrames and compares their values to check for equality, addressing the bug.
