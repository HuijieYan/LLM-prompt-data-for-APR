### Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to wrongly return `True` instead of `False`. This is because the function does not properly handle the case where identical blocks have different locations, resulting in misrepresentation of the equality of dataframes.

The problematic part is the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The function retrieves the blocks from the dataframes and sorts them based on a combination of the block type name and the manager locations. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of blocks being identical but positioned differently within the dataframe.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks needs to be adjusted to properly account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. This can be resolved by considering the content of the blocks rather than their positions.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # comparison of blocks based on content
    self_blocks = self.get_numeric_data()
    other_blocks = other.get_numeric_data()
    return self_blocks.equals(other_blocks)
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function addresses the root cause of the bug by comparing the numeric data blocks of the dataframes rather than their positions. This ensures that the comparison reflects the actual content of the dataframes, resulting in a proper evaluation of equality.
