Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class has a bug that causes it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The failing test provided in the error message and the GitHub issue both confirm this bug.

Potential error locations:
1. Comparing the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances, especially the `canonicalize` function

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not account for the case where the blocks in the DataFrames may be identical but have different locations. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare the actual values of the blocks in addition to their positions. This can be achieved by modifying the logic within the function to compare the data directly rather than just the block locations.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare the data in the blocks in addition to the block order
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now compares the actual data within the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances, ensuring that it correctly identifies instances where the DataFrames have identical blocks but different locations.
