The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test to fail. The error message shows that `assert True is False`, indicating that the function returns `True` when it should return `False`. This occurs despite the fact that the two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are not equal.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the relevant variables right before the buggy function's return, the bug is identified to be occurring in the sorting of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort these blocks based on their type name and manager locations.

The bug is likely occurring due to the fact that the `canonicalize` function returns a list of tuples instead of a single tuple. This causes the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to always return `True`, leading to the incorrect result from the `equals` function.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function must be modified to return a single tuple, combining the type name and manager locations. This will ensure that the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a single tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
