The error is likely occurring in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The failing test is checking for the inequality of two dataframes using the `equals` method, and the error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` failed. 

The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class performs several checks to determine if two block managers are equal. However, there is a redundancy in the canonicalization function. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the `BlockManager` class and once inside the class, leading to a conflict. 

To fix this bug, it is necessary to remove the duplicate `canonicalize` function. After removing the duplicate function and ensuring that the canonicalization function is correctly referenced within the `equals` method, the `BlockManager` class should be able to compare two block managers correctly and the failing test should pass.

Here is the corrected version of the `BlockManager` class:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Removed the duplicate "canonicalize" function from the class

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

After this change, the failing test should pass, indicating that the bug has been fixed.
