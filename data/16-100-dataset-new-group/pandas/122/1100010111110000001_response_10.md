The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison logic between two dataframes. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` attempts to compare two dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method, and it expects the result to be `False`. However, the test fails with the assertion error `assert True is False` because the comparison returns `True` instead of `False`.

The buggy function is using the `equals` method to compare blocks in the dataframes, but it seems to be misinterpreting the data structure or comparing incorrect attributes, which leads to the wrong comparison result.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to properly compare the dataframes based on their content. It should compare the data in each column and row of the dataframes to determine if they are equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.index) != len(other.index) or len(self.columns) != len(other.columns):
        return False
    for col in self.columns:
        if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected version of the function compares the length of the indices and columns first, and then iterates through each column to compare the data within the columns. If any data is found to be different, it returns `False`. If all comparisons pass, it returns `True`. This approach ensures a thorough comparison of the dataframes' contents.
