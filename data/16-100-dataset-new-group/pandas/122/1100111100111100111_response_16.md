The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is meant to create a tuple combining the type name and the mgr_locs, but it does not appear to be working as intended due to incorrect or missing implementation.

Also, there seems to be an issue with the comparison of `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function, as its value is not directly comparable.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates the expected tuples based on the type name and the mgr_locs, and that these tuples can be properly sorted and compared.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The main change in the corrected version is the modification of the `canonicalize` function to properly generate a tuple of type name and mgr_locs. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

Please note that the usage of `str(type(block))` assumes that the type name would serve as a unique identifier for different block types. If the assumption is incorrect, further adjustments to the `canonicalize` function may be necessary.
