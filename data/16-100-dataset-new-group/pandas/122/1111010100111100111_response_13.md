The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the pandas library is not correctly comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The existing code is incorrectly comparing the equality of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes, which is causing the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is based on their order in memory, rather than the actual content of the blocks. This leads to incorrect results, causing the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` should be based on the content of the blocks rather than their memory locations. Utilizing a different approach to comparing the blocks will resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare blocks based on their content
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version compares each pair of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `equals` method. If any pair of blocks is not equal, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
