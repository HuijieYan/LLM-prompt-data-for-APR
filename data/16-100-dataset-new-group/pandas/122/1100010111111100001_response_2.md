The bug appears to be in the `equals` function, as it doesn't accurately compare the values of the two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`). The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, and the failing test provides correct input parameters and values.

The bug is likely in the logic of the `equals` function, specifically in how it compares the two DataFrames. The function should correctly iterate through the blocks of the two DataFrames and compare their contents to determine if the DataFrames are equal.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should accurately compare the blocks of the two DataFrames, ensuring that the values within each block are compared correctly. Additionally, the order of the blocks should also be taken into consideration during comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```
This version correctly compares the blocks within the DataFrames and ensures that the DataFrames are considered equal only if all their blocks are also equal.
