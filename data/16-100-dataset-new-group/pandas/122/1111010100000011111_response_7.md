The buggy function `equals` is expected to compare two BlockManager objects and return whether they are equal or not.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not correctly handle the comparison of axes objects.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may not be correct and could lead to the wrong comparison of blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the comparison of axes and blocks, leading to incorrect True or False return values. The GitHub issue indicates that the DataFrame.equals() method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the comparison of axes is done correctly. This may involve iterating over the axes and comparing their elements to ensure they are equal to each other.
2. We need to sort and compare the blocks correctly. This may involve identifying a unique identifier for each block and using it for comparison.

Here's a corrected version of the function based on the above analysis:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block), block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison of axes and blocks is done correctly, addressing the issues identified. It also satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
