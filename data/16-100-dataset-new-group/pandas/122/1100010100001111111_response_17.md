### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is not returning the expected output for certain input cases, as reported in the GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The function compares the attributes of two `BlockManager` objects and returns `True` if all the attributes are the same, and `False` otherwise. The function should return `False` for the provided test case but seems to return `True`. 

Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` might not be taking into account differences in block locations or other attributes.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function may not be working as expected, leading to a false positive comparison.

### Bug Explanation
The bug might be caused by the comparison not taking into account differences in block locations or the order in which the blocks are stored. The values of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted based on the `canonicalize` function, which may not fully capture the differences. As a result, the function incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and ensure the function behaves as expected, we need to modify the comparison process to consider all relevant attributes of the `BlockManager` objects. Additionally, the sorting process using the `canonicalize` function may need to be refined to capture the differences more accurately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare each block in the same order
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```
The corrected version includes a modified comparison process that iterates through each block in the `BlockManager` objects and compares them one by one. This ensures that differences in block locations or other attributes are captured accurately. The sorting based on the `canonicalize` function is removed, and the comparison is done directly.
