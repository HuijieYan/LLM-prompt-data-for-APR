Based on the provided information, it seems the bug in the equals function of the BlockManager class is related to the sorting of blocks and their comparison. The canonicalize function is supposed to be used to order the blocks and compare them. However, the canonicalize function is defined twice, once within the BlockManager class and once outside the class. This is likely causing confusion and leading to the bug.

To fix this bug, we should remove the duplicate definition of the canonicalize function and ensure that the correct canonicalize function (defined within the BlockManager class) is being used when sorting and comparing blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the equals function should work as expected and fulfill the expected input/output values provided.
