### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is a method of the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure in pandas to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with the same columns but different values, and expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.
- The GitHub issue reports that `df3.equals(df4)` incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Error Location:
- The `equals` function compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` and returns `True` or `False` based on their equality.
- The issue seems to be with the comparison of the blocks, specifically with the canonicalization of the block order.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks when the data within the blocks are in different locations, leading to the `equals` function incorrectly returning `True` for DataFrames that should be considered not equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We can fix the bug by ensuring that when comparing the blocks, we also take into account the locations of the blocks in addition to their content.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using both type name and mgr_locs for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # sort the blocks based on canonicalization
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # compare sorted blocks and their locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
