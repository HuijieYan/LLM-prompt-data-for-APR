The current `equals` function has a bug where it returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations. This bug is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail, as it expects the function to return `False`.

The potential error location in the current `equals` function is in the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

The cause of the bug is that the current `canonicalize` function does not take into account the different locations of identical blocks, resulting in the incorrect comparison of block equality.

One strategy to fix the bug is to modify the canonicalize function to include both the type name and the block locations in the comparison. This would ensure that identical blocks with different locations are treated as different.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and locations of the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix would resolve the issue posted in GitHub titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."
