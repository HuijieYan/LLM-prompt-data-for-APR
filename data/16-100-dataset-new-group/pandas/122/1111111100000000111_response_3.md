The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This method is used to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal.

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` method. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is done without considering the order of the blocks or their locations.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of blocks within the `equals` method does not account for the order or locations of the blocks, which may lead to incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. The GitHub issue indicates that the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks within the `equals` method considers the order and locations of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: repr(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: repr(block))
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we sort the blocks using their representations (`repr(block)`) before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the order and locations of the blocks, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
