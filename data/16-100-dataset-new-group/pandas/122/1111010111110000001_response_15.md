The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The `equals` function is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` and determine if they are equal. However, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` from `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` indicates that the `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The cause of the bug is likely in the `equals` function, where the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is not producing the correct result. This is causing the incorrect behavior when comparing two `DataFrames` using the `equals` function, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison logic in the `equals` function to accurately compare the blocks of the two instances of `BlockManager`.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Sort blocks based on type name and mgr_locs
        def canonicalize(blocks):
            return [(block, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in blocks]

        self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
        other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)

        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False

        for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
            block1, dtype1, mgr_locs1 = self_blocks[i]
            block2, dtype2, mgr_locs2 = other_blocks[i]
            
            if dtype1 != dtype2 or mgr_locs1 != mgr_locs2 or not block1.equals(block2):
                return False
        
        return True
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the blocks based on their type name and mgr_locs. Then a comparison loop iterates through the sorted blocks and checks for any inequality, returning `False` if found. If no inequality is found, it returns `True`, indicating the equality of the two instances.

With this corrected `equals` function, the failing test should pass, and the comparison of two instances of `BlockManager` should produce the expected results.
