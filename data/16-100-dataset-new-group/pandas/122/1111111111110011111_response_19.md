The buggy function `equals` has an issue with comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` when the two DataFrames have identical blocks but in different locations.

The bug is identified in the block of code within the buggy function that attempts to compare the blocks of the two DataFrames. The issue occurs when the function `canonicalize` is used to sort the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison and resulting in the wrong output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function and ensure that it properly compares the blocks based on their type name and location.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), tuple(block.mgr_locs.flatten()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version modifies the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based on their type name and location. This ensures that the comparison is accurate and resolves the bug.

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and return the expected output, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
