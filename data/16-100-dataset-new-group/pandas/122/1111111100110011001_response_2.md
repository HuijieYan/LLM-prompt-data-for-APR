The bug in the provided function can be traced to the improper usage of the `equals` method for comparing two DataFrames. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, which means that the `equals` method did not return the expected value of `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to use the correct approach to compare DataFrames. The current implementation is attempting to use an internal sorting method to compare the block order within the DataFrames, but this is unnecessary and leads to the incorrect result.

We can fix the bug by directly comparing the values of the DataFrames using the `equals` method provided by the Pandas library.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

This corrected implementation directly compares the values of the DataFrames using the `equals` method. This approach avoids unnecessary internal sorting and correctly compares the DataFrames as intended. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
