### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error could be in the `canonicalize` function and the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to check equality.

### Explain the cause of the bug
The bug causes the `equals` method to return True even when the blocks are identical but with different locations. This is due to the incorrect comparison logic.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
The `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to ensure that it takes into account the locations of the blocks. Additionally, the comparison logic of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` needs to be updated to correctly compare the block contents.

### Provide a corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs) for block in blocks]
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This corrected version addresses the issue by properly considering the locations of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function and then comparing the blocks based on their content along with their locations.
