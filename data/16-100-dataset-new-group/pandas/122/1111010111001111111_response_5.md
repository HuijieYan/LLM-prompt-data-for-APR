Based on the GitHub issue, the problem occurs when the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. The `equals` function compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.

Upon analyzing the code, the issue likely arises from the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations using the `canonicalize` function but does not account for identical blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect equality comparison.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the locations of blocks when sorting them. This modification would ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are not mistakenly equated.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the manager locations of the blocks when creating the tuple for sorting. This modification ensures that the comparison accounts for blocks with identical content but different locations, addressing the issue reported on GitHub and allowing the failing test to pass.
