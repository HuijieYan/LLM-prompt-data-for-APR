The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` using the `equals` method. The failing test case is failing because it expects the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` to be not equal, but the buggy `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the contents of the axes instead of just their references.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    # Compare the contents of the axes 
    if not all(pd.api.types.is_list_like(ax) and ax.equals(ax2) or (ax == ax2) for ax, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass, thereby satisfying the expected input/output values.
