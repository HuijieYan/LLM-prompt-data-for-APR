The bug in the given function "equals" seems to be related to the comparison of the "self_axes" and "other_axes". The test case "test_dataframe_not_equal" is failing when comparing two data frames "df1" and "df2", indicating that the "equals" function is not returning the expected value. 

The "equals" function starts by comparing the lengths of "self_axes" and "other_axes", which seems correct. Then, it compares each pair of axes using the "equals" method, and if any of them are not equal, it returns False. After that, it consolidates both "self" and "other" objects in place. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks in both objects.

To fix the bug, we need to analyze the logic and ensure that the axes are correctly compared using the "equals" method. Additionally, we should verify the consolidation process and the block comparisons.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the "equals" function should now return the expected value for the failing test case "test_dataframe_not_equal."
