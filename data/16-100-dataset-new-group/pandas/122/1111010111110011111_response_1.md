The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test in the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function to fail. The error message indicates that True is being returned instead of False as expected.

The issue is due to the incorrect comparison of the blocks in the `equals` method, which is not properly comparing the contents of the blocks. This leads to the method returning True even when the DataFrames are not equal.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to correctly compare the individual blocks within the `BlockManager` objects and return False if any of the blocks are not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should properly compare the individual blocks within the `BlockManager` objects and return the expected False when the DataFrames are not equal. This will resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
