The buggy function `equals` is comparing two block managers and it fails when comparing data frames with different dtypes for the same columns. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the data frames have different dtypes for the same columns.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to also check for dtype equivalence when comparing the blocks. We can do this by adding a condition inside the loop that compares the blocks, checking if the dtypes are equal for the blocks being compared.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.dtype.name == oblock.dtype.name for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added an additional condition inside the `all` statement that checks if the dtypes of the blocks being compared are equal. If the dtypes are not equal, the function will return `False`, indicating that the data frames are not equal.

With this corrected implementation, the function should now pass the failing test case.
