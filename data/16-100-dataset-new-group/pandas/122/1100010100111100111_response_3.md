The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should return `False` in the failing test case. After analyzing the failing test case and the runtime values, it seems the issue is with the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method.

It appears that the `canonicalize` function used to sort `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` is not working as expected, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly capture the characteristics of the blocks for a proper comparison. Additionally, we need to check if the types and locations of the blocks are the same in both `self` and `other`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_characteristics(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_characteristics)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_characteristics)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks based on their characteristics, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
