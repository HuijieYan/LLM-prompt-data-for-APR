The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, there are several issues in the current implementation:

1. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the class and once inside the class. This can cause confusion and may lead to the wrong function being called.

2. The comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is using the `equals` method, but the `equals` method itself contains a call to `_consolidate_inplace`, which modifies the `BlockManager` objects. This means that the comparison is not being made on the original objects.

To fix the bug:

1. Remove the redundant `canonicalize` function definition outside the class.
2. Remove the calls to `_consolidate_inplace` within the `equals` method so that the comparison is made on the original objects.
3. Instead of using the `equals` method to compare the blocks, we can directly compare the `values` attribute of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly by values
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if self_block.values != other_block.values:
            return False
    
    return True
```
