## Correction:

The buggy function fails because the `equals` method is not correctly comparing the DataFrame blocks. The issue is that the method is comparing identical blocks with different locations and returning True, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should first ensure that the block order is canonicalized before comparing the blocks. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account the actual block values and their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values._ndarray_values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # modified to use block values in canonicalization

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method will correctly compare the DataFrame blocks and return the expected results, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
