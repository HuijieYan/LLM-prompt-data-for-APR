The buggy function `equals` tries to compare two `BlockManager` objects, but there are issues with the comparison logic and the sorting of blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`.

The failing test resulted in the following erroneous input/output variable values:
- `self` and `other` are both instances of `BlockManager` with different blocks
- The `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are tuples containing the blocks of `BlockManager`

The expected input/output variable values for the failing test are:
- `self` and `other` should be instances of `BlockManager`
- The `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` should be tuples containing the blocks of `BlockManager` in a specific order

The bug in the function `equals` is caused by improper comparison and sorting of blocks. To fix this, we need to modify the logic for comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function uses the type name of the block and its `mgr_locs` for sorting the blocks. This ensures that the blocks are properly ordered before comparison.

With this correction, the `equals` function should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
