## Bug Fix Strategy
Based on the GitHub issue and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug is related to the `equals` function incorrectly returning True when checking for identical blocks with different locations. It is clear that the comparison logic in the function needs to be corrected to properly handle these cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to properly handle cases where the blocks have different locations. We should ensure that the comparison is based on the content of the blocks rather than their locations.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.is_sliced_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.mgr_locs.is_sliced_array().equals(oblock.mgr_locs.is_sliced_array()) 
        and block.values.equals(oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version of the function, the comparison logic has been updated to compare the values of the blocks and their locations. This ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the blocks have different locations but contain the same data, as described in the GitHub issue.
