The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing two DataFrames and returning the wrong result. The expected output of `df1.equals(df2)` is `False`, but it is returning `True`. 

The issue is caused by the incorrect comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` without considering the actual contents of the DataFrames, leading to the function returning `True` when it should be `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is based on the actual contents of the DataFrames and not just the axis labels. We can modify the function to compare the content of each block within the DataFrames, ensuring that it produces the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False

    # compare each block in the DataFrames
    for self_block in self.blocks:
        for other_block in other.blocks:
            if (self_block.values != other_block.values).any():
                return False
    
    return True
```

This correction modifies the function to first compare the shapes of the DataFrames. If the shapes differ, the function returns `False`. Then, it iterates through each block within the DataFrames and compares their values. If any block has different values, the function returns `False`. If all comparisons pass, the function returns `True`.
