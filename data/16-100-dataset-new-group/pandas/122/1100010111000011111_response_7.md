The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. It is supposed to compare two dataframes for equality but is failing to do so, as seen in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` from `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.

The bug seems to be related to comparing the content of the dataframes instead of just the references. This is causing it to return `True` when it should be `False`.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the comparison mechanism used in the `equals` method. It compares the axes of the dataframes first, then consolidates them in place and compares the blocks. However, the issue seems to arise because it doesn't consider the order of the blocks in the dataframes. This causes it to erroneously return `True` when the ordering of the blocks is different but the content is the same.

To fix this bug, the `equals` method needs to explicitly consider the ordering of the blocks when comparing them. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the dataframes and return `False` for the failing test case. This fix should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the bug.
