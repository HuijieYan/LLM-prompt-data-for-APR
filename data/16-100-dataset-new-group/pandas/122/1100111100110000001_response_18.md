The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library. The function is responsible for checking if two `BlockManager` objects are equal based on their axes and blocks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice within the `BlockManager` class. This can cause confusion and lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The actual comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method may not be functioning as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of the two dataframes `df1` and `df2` is not returning the expected result, resulting in an assertion error. The error message shows that the comparison is returning `True`, even though it is expected to be `False`.

To fix the bug, the duplicate `canonicalize` function should be removed to avoid any ambiguity. Additionally, the comparison logic should be carefully reviewed and modified to ensure that it correctly compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
        
    # Sort the blocks by their type name and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    # Check if each pair of blocks is equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making these changes, re-run the failing test and it should pass without any assertion error.
