The buggy function contains a bug that causes it to return incorrect results. The bug is likely in the way the function compares the contents of the blocks within the BlockManager. It sorts the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs but does not consider the order, and then it checks if the sorted blocks are equal. This is potentially incorrect if the order of the blocks matters.

A strategy to fix this bug would be to compare the blocks directly rather than sorting them and then comparing. Also, the function could take into account the concatenation order of the blocks when performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare each block directly
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the order of the blocks and accurately determines if the two BlockManagers are equal.
