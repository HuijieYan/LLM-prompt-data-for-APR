### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` could be causing an issue if the lengths don't match.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function's output may be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the comparison of lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` not matching, and the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Address the mismatch in lengths between `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Ensure that the sorting based on the `canonicalize` function is correct.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort blocks by mgr_locs and dtype name
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.mgr_locs, x.dtype.name))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.mgr_locs, x.dtype.name))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```
