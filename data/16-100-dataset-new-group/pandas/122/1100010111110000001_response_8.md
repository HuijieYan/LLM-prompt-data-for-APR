The issue in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of DataFrames using the `equals` method where the comparison is expected to return `False` but instead returns `True`. 

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not properly distinguishing the blocks of different data types, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data type in the tuple for sorting and comparison, ensuring that different data types are correctly distinguished.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the DataFrames comparison should now work as expected and return `False` for the failing test.
