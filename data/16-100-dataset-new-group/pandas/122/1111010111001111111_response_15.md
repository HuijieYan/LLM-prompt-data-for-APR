To fix the buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class, we need to address the issue related to identical blocks with different locations returning an incorrect result. The bug seems to stem from the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which may not correctly handle the comparison of identically structured blocks with different locations.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function or change the block comparison approach to account for blocks with different locations but identical content.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        # Comparing each block in self.blocks with corresponding blocks in other.blocks
        for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
            if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
                return False
        
        return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should properly handle the identified bug by comparing each block in `self.blocks` with its corresponding block in `other.blocks`, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` now passes as expected.
