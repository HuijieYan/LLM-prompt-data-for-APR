The bug in the provided function `equals` is likely due to the sorting and comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists, which may not be ordered as expected. This can result in unexpected behavior and cause the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists are sorted and compared correctly. We also need to verify that the `self_axes` and `other_axes` lists are compared accurately.

Following these steps, a corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below.

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions here)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the function `equals` should now properly compare the `self` and `other` block managers and pass the failing test.
