The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. The bug is specifically related to the comparison of DataFrame objects and leads to incorrect results.

The main cause of the bug is the way the function compares the blocks within the DataFrame objects. It fails to properly account for the locations of the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to be revised to consider the block locations when comparing the DataFrame objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above changes, the `equals` function will consider both the types and locations of blocks when performing the equality comparison, which should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
