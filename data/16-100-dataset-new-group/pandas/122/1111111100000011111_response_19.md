The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return incorrect results for identical blocks with different locations. The issue was reported on GitHub with the expected output to be False, but the method is returning True.

The buggy function does not handle the comparison of blocks with different locations properly. It compares the blocks directly without considering their location, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to consider the locations of the blocks while comparing them. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on their type name and locations before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks
    canonicalize = lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method will now consider the locations of the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are treated as unequal.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the expected output is returned for the failing test case.
