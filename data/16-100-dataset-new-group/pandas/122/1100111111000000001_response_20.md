The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class from the `pandas.core.internals.managers` file. The function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.

The test function that the buggy function fails is `test_dataframe_not_equal` from `pandas.tests.internals.test_internals`.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the `canonicalize` function. This function is defined within the `equals` method, but it is also defined outside the method within the same class. This can lead to confusion and ambiguity.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the `BlockManager` class and once within the `equals` method. This can cause conflicts and incorrect behavior.

One strategy to fix the bug is to remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method. Instead, the `canonicalize` function should only be defined once within the `BlockManager` class.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other methods and functions...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
