The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. However, the failing test indicates that the function is not returning the correct result, as it should return False for the given input but it returns True.

Upon analyzing the code and the failing test, it can be observed that the bug may be caused by the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The ordering of blocks may not be consistent across different executions, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to modify the `canonicalize` function to use a deterministic approach for sorting the blocks. One possible approach is to sort the blocks based on their data values instead of their dtype and mgr_locs. This will ensure consistent ordering for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on their data values
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly handle the comparison of BlockManager objects and pass the failing test.
