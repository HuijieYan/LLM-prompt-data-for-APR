The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of blocks in the `BlockManager` class. The `equals` function compares the sorted `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. However, the comparison of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` does not guarantee correct sorting, resulting in false failures in tests like `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

To fix this bug, we need to redefine the `canonicalize` function to take into account the block's data and dtype in a better way. One way to do this is to convert the block's data into a tuple and then add the dtype name to it for better sorting. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.T.tolist(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the block's values and dtype name and uses it for sorting. This ensures consistent and correct sorting of the blocks, fixing the bug in the `equals` function.
