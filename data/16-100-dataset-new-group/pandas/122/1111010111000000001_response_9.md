The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is supposed to check whether the current `BlockManager` object is equal to another object of the same type. The method first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects, then consolidates them in place and compares the blocks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. There might be an issue with the comparison of the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects.
2. There could be a problem with the consolidation of the blocks and the subsequent comparison.

The bug occurs because the `equals` method does not handle the comparison of two DataFrame objects properly. In the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`, two DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` are created with different values, and the `equals` method is called to compare them. The `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class is not able to properly handle the comparison of the DataFrames, leading to a failed assertion.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method needs to be updated to correctly compare the contents of the `BlockManager` objects, ensuring that it can handle the comparison of DataFrames properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should be able to correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects, including DataFrames, and it should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
