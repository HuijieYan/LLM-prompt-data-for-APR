## Correction

The issue with the `equals` function seems to be related to the `canonicalize` function that is used to sort the blocks within the `BlockManager`. It appears that the `canonicalize` function is not correctly handling and distinguishing between blocks with different locations but identical content. This leads to the `equals` function returning `True` when it should be `False`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly handles the distinction between identical blocks with different locations. We can modify the sorting process for the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` by including the block locations in the sorting criteria.

The corrected version of the `equals` function with the modified sorting process for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the block content and locations would be as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and block content to ensure distinction
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should correctly differentiate between blocks with identical content but different locations, and return the expected result. This should resolve the issue originally posted on GitHub.
