The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test. The issue lies in the comparison of the blocks in the `BlockManager`. The function compares the blocks and their order, but it does not account for a situation where the block values are different but in the same order.

The proposed strategy for fixing the bug is to update the comparison method to consider the block values and their order. This can be achieved by using a tuple of the block values and their order as the key for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining values and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version of the function should now pass the failing test. After making these changes, it is important to run the failing test to verify that the bug has been fixed.
