The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison takes into account the actual block contents rather than just the block locations.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks in the DataFrames. This comparison should consider the block values, not just the block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on their actual values
    return all(
        any(
            np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for oblock in other.blocks
        ) for block in self.blocks
    )
```

This corrected version compares the block values in `self` with the values in `other`, ensuring that the comparison considers the actual data within the blocks.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` pass.
