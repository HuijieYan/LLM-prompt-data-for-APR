The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances.

The function compares the axes of two `BlockManager` instances and then tries to compare their blocks. However, the comparison is flawed, as it sorts the blocks based on the type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute. This comparison method can lead to incorrect results, especially when the blocks are not consolidated.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the comparison method for the blocks of the `BlockManager`. Instead of simply sorting the blocks based on their type names and `mgr_locs`, we should compare the blocks based on their actual content. We can do this by iterating through the blocks and checking for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the function iterates through the blocks of both `BlockManager` instances and compares each block for equality. If any block is not equal, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that the `BlockManager` instances are equal.
