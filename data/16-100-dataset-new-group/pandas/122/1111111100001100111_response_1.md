The issue reported on GitHub is related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returning True in the case of identical blocks with different locations. The expected output is False, but the function returns True under certain circumstances.

Upon reviewing the provided buggy function and the relevant runtime input/output values, it appears that the issue arises from the comparison of blocks in the `equals()` method. The comparison does not account for the possibility of blocks with identical content but different locations (mgr_locs).

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals()` method to consider the comparison of blocks with the same content but potentially different locations. We can achieve this by updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block's manager locations. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` method:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the updated `equals()` method, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block's content, manager locations, and data type. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are not falsely considered equal.

By making these changes, the `equals()` method will now correctly compare the blocks within the BlockManager, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
