## Code Analysis

The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function compares two BlockManager objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.

The `equals` function calls the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their data type and manager locations. It then checks if the sorted blocks for both BlockManager objects are equal.

The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrame objects, `df1` and `df2`, with different values in the columns and expects the `equals` function to return `False`. 

The root cause of the bug appears to be the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The sorting considers the block's data type and manager locations but fails to account for the actual values within the blocks. As a result, two BlockManager objects with different values in the same positions are considered equal.

## Bug Cause
The `canonicalize` function only uses the block's data type and manager locations to determine equality, which is incorrect. It should consider comparing actual block values when determining equality between blocks.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to consider the values within the blocks when sorting them. Additionally, the `_consolidate_inplace` function calls within the `equals` function appear to be unnecessary, and they can be removed.

## Corrected Function
The following is the corrected version of the `equals` function.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare the blocks
    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(
        self.blocks,
        key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    )
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(
        other.blocks,
        key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    )
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the sorting key to include the block values in addition to the data type and manager locations, we ensure that the `equals` function compares the actual values within the blocks for equality. This change addresses the bug and makes the function align with the expected behavior.
