This buggy function compares two BlockManager objects to determine if they are equal. The issue with the function is that it does not properly handle the comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager objects. It attempts to sort and compare the blocks by type and location, but it does not appropriately handle the comparison of the actual data within the blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly compare the data within the blocks and ensure that the comparison accounts for all the relevant attributes of the BlockManager and its blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare blocks
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if self_block.shape != other_block.shape:
            return False
        if not self_block.index.equals(other_block.index):
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version compares the shapes, indices, and values of the blocks within the BlockManager objects, ensuring a comprehensive comparison to determine equality.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
