The bug in the function `equals` is causing it to return `True` incorrectly. To fix the bug, we need to address the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` list in the function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager`. It is sorting the blocks and then comparing them using the `equals` method, which is leading to the incorrect result.

To fix this bug, we need to compare the blocks directly without sorting them. We should iterate over the blocks and compare them one by one using the `equals` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly without sorting
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the blocks directly without sorting them, which should fix the bug. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
