The bug in the `equals` function is likely in the `canonicalize` function, where it sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using `key=canonicalize`. The bug might be related to the way it sorts and compares blocks.

The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects that `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`. However, the buggy `equals` function may incorrectly return `True` in some cases due to a bug in sorting and comparing the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic in the `canonicalize` function and the comparison of sorted blocks in the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks by block type and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and return the expected results.
