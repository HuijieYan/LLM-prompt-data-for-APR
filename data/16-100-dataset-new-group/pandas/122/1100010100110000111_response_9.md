## Potential Error Location
The potential error location is in the `equals` method where the sorting of the blocks is likely causing the issue. The method sorts the blocks based on their type names and `mgr_locs`, which may not be a reliable way to compare two dataframes for equality.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting might not be a reliable way to determine the equality of the dataframes, especially if the two dataframes have identical blocks with different locations. As a result, the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` in this case.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to compare the blocks directly without relying on the sorting based on the `canonicalize` function. Instead of using `sorted` on the blocks, we should iterate through each block and compare it directly with the corresponding block in the other dataframe.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks of the two dataframes without the need for sorting. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result for dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.
