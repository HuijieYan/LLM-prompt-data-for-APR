The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. It looks like the comparison neglects an essential attribute of the block, causing the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison also considers the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block when sorting and comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.key)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes sorting and comparison of blocks based on the `mgr_locs` attribute, considering it as a key for canonicalizing the blocks. This should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
