The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class appears to be comparing the attributes of two instances of the class. The code seems to be comparing the axes and blocks of the two instances for equality. However, there are potential issues in the function that need to be addressed.

One potential cause of the bug could be the comparison of `self.axes` and `other.axes`. If these axes are not sorted in the same order, the comparison may fail even if the values are the same.

Another potential cause could be the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison is based on a canonical order, but the sorting logic may not be accurate, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the sorting logic for both axes and blocks to ensure that they are sorted consistently before comparison.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = sorted(self.axes), sorted(other.axes)
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return len(self.blocks) == len(other.blocks) and all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, we first sort the axes of both instances before comparing them. Then, we sort the blocks using a lambda function that combines the type name and the `mgr_locs` to achieve a consistent order for comparison. We also perform a length check before comparing the blocks to ensure they have the same number of elements.

This corrected version addresses the potential issues in the original function and should satisfy the expected input/output values.
