The bug in the function `equals` causes it to return True in cases where it should return False for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The issue reported on GitHub confirms that the `equals` function is not returning the expected False for identical but differently located blocks.

The potential error locations in the code include the comparison between self and other axes lengths, sorting of self and other blocks, and the final comparison of each block using the equals method.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the canonicalization process of the blocks to include their entire content, not just the dtype name and mgr_locs. This can be achieved by converting the blocks to a hashable form that incorporates their contents, and then using this hashable form for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block by converting to hashable form
    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(str(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function converts the block to a hashable form using the `hash` function on the string representation of the block's values. This ensures that the comparison includes the entire content of the blocks rather than focusing solely on the dtype names and mgr_locs. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function behaves correctly in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
