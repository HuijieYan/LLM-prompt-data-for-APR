The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is evidenced by the failing test and the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The issue is in the sorting of blocks within the `equals` function, which leads to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations resulting in `True` instead of `False`. This is because the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their data type name and location, but it is not consistent with the location information.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to modify the `canonicalize` function to only use the data type name for sorting and comparison, and not include the location information. This would ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not erroneously marked as equal.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # modified canonicalize function to only use the data type name for sorting and comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the `equals` function correctly handles the comparison of blocks in different locations, and it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
