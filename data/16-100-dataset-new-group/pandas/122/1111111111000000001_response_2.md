The buggy function is `equals` of the `BlockManager` class in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The purpose of this function is to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of axis lengths (`len(self_axes) != len(other_axes)`) may not accurately represent the equality of the two `BlockManager` objects.
2. The sorting and comparison of blocks could be ambiguous due to unconsolidated blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic in the `equals` function does not handle mixed-type dataframes correctly, leading to incorrect results in cases where the data type of columns in the two dataframes are different.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to improve the comparison process for mixed-type dataframes within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of axes is changed to a loop that checks the equality of each axis separately. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function is modified to include the data type of the blocks for more accurate sorting and comparison of the blocks. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
