The potential issues in the buggy function are:
1. It is not handling the case where `self.blocks` or `other.blocks` is empty.
2. It is assuming `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are always the same length.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not address the case where `self.blocks` or `other.blocks` is empty, leading to a potential error when checking the length of these attributes.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.blocks` or `other.blocks` is empty and also ensure that the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are the same before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # handle the case when self.blocks or other.blocks is empty
    if not self.blocks and not other.blocks:
        return True
    if (self.blocks is None and other.blocks) or (self.blocks and other.blocks is None):
        return False
    
    # ensure that the length of self.blocks and other.blocks are the same
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
