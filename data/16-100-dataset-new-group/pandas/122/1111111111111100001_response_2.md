The bug in the `equals` function appears to be related to sorting the blocks and comparing them. The function tries to consolidate in place, sort the blocks by a custom function `canonicalize`, and then compare them. However, due to the custom sorting, it is failing to compare the expected DataFrame to the actual DataFrame, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the custom sort function `canonicalize` works as expected. 

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, hash(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we use the type of the block along with its hash as the key for sorting in the `canonicalize` function. This ensures that the sorting is stable and allows for proper comparison between the blocks.

After making this change, the failing test should pass and there should be no AssertionErrors raised.
