The buggy function `equals` is not working as expected. The `equals` function is comparing two DataFrames, `self` and `other`, which in the failing test contain different values in their columns. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True`, which is unexpected.

The potential error in the `equals` function is with the sorting and comparison of the blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on the block's type name and `mgr_locs`. However, this can cause unexpected behavior when comparing DataFrames with different values in their columns.

To fix the bug, the sorting and comparison logic for the blocks should be revised to compare the actual values in the DataFrames' columns rather than sorting them based on type name and `mgr_locs`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare axes
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Compare values in DataFrames
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

In this corrected version, we compare the DataFrames' axes and then directly compare the values using `self.values.equals(other.values)`.

This approach ensures that the actual values in the DataFrames are compared, addressing the bug in the original function.
