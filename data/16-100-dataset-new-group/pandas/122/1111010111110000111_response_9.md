The potential error in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is that it is not handling the comparison of blocks with different locations correctly.

The cause of the bug is that when comparing the blocks, the method does not take into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. This results in the `equals` method returning `True` incorrectly when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` method to account for identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of identifying identical blocks with different locations by using tuple comparison of `mgr_locs` to ensure that they are correctly distinguished. This change aligns with the reported GitHub issue and should resolve the bug.
