The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test because it is not correctly comparing the two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function is comparing the axes of the two `BlockManagers` and then comparing the blocks in a sorted order, using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks.

The comparison of the blocks is incorrect because the `canonicalize` function only considers the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of the blocks, but it does not consider the actual values in the blocks. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing the blocks for equality.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual values in the blocks when sorting them. This will ensure that the comparison of the blocks is based on their content rather than just their data type and manager locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the values in the blocks when sorting them. This ensures that the comparison of the blocks for equality takes into account the actual content of the blocks. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function work correctly, passing the failing test.
