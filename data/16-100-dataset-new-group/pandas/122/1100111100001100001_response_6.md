The buggy function seems to be trying to compare two BlockManager objects using a combination of their axes and block data. However, it appears that the comparison function may not be implemented correctly as per the provided test case. 

The buggy function `equals(self, other)` first checks whether the number of axes in `self` is the same as in `other`. If they are not, it returns False. Next, it checks whether each pair of axes is equal or not using the `.equals()` method. If any pair of axes are not equal, it returns False. Then, it consolidates the blocks in both `self` and `other`, and again checks if the number of blocks are the same. Finally, it sorts the blocks in `self` and `other` based on a canonicalization function and then checks whether each pair of blocks are equal or not.

Based on the input variables and their types, as well as the variables right before the function's return, it appears that the canonicalization function `canonicalize(block)` is not implemented correctly. The function tries to combine the type name and `mgr_locs` attribute of the block, but there is no `mgr_locs` attribute in the given variables. In addition to this, the use of `dtype.name` within the canonicalization function might not be appropriate.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization function should be modified to consider the block type and its data for comparison. Additionally, it should handle different types of blocks appropriately.

Iterating through the blocks and comparing each pair of blocks can be done by ensuring that the `equals` method for the Block objects is implemented correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.values, block._ref_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.values, block._ref_locs))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I updated the canonicalization function to consider the block type, values, and reference locations for comparison. Then, I used the sorted blocks for comparison, while leveraging the `equals` method for the Block objects to compare each pair of blocks.
