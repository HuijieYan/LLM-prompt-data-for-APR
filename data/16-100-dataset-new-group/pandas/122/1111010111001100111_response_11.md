## Correction 

### Analysis:
The `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is expected to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to check for equality. However, the bug in the current implementation causes it to return incorrect results in some cases, such as when the blocks have the same content in different locations.

The issue reported on GitHub confirms that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` even when the blocks have the same content in different locations, leading to failed test cases.

### Bug cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. Since the comparison is based on the order of the blocks, it fails to handle cases where the blocks have the same content but are located differently within the `BlockManager`. This results in incorrect equality checks.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to compare the actual content of the blocks rather than simply their order. This can be achieved by comparing the content of the blocks without considering their locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Compare the content of blocks
        self_content = {block.values.tostring() for block in self.blocks}
        other_content = {block.values.tostring() for block in other.blocks}

        return self_content == other_content
```
In the corrected version, after the initial checks for axes and block length equality, the content of the blocks is compared using their values to ensure accurate equality checks.

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should return the correct result and pass the failing test mentioned in the GitHub issue.
