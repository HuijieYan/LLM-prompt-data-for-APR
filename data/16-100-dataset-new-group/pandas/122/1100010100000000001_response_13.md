## Analyzing the buggy function
The function `equals` is comparing two objects based on their axes and blocks. It's trying to check if the objects are equal by comparing their axes lengths and then consolidating and comparing their blocks.

## Potential error locations
1. The length of `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not be the same, leading to a false negative comparison.
2. There could be unconsolidated blocks that are not being handled properly.
3. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might not be done correctly.

## Cause of the bug
The bug may be caused by unconsolidated blocks and the incorrect comparison of axes lengths.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check for unconsolidated blocks and handle them properly.
2. Ensure the comparison of axes lengths is done correctly.
3. Verify the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is accurate.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self._rebuild_blknos_and_blklocs()
    other_blocks = other._rebuild_blknos_and_blklocs()
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks
    return all(pd.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
