The issue here seems to be that the `equals` function is not properly handling the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The bug might be caused by a mismatch in the ordering of the blocks before attempting to compare them. 

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to first validate the integrity of the blocks and then compare their contents. This would involve sorting the blocks based on a key that identifies them uniquely before the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a key for sorting blocks
    def block_key(block):
        return block._get_numeric_data().values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the comparison of blocks is based on a key that uniquely identifies each block, ensuring that the comparison is consistent and accurate. This approach should resolve the mismatch and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
