## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The issue here seems to be related to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals()` function to correctly handle comparing blocks with different locations.

One potential solution is to modify the `canonicalize()` function to use a combination of the type name, block values, and block locations to uniquely identify and compare the blocks. Additionally, we can handle the comparison of blocks with different locations within the `equals()` function to ensure the correct comparison results.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a combination of the type name, values, and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the blocks, handling different locations properly
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if block.dtype != oblock.dtype or not np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) or not np.array_equal(block.mgr_locs.as_array, oblock.mgr_locs.as_array):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals()` function ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly handled and compared. It should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
