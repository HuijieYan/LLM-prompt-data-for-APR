The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of block locations when sorting the blocks. The bug seems to be leading to an incorrect result when comparing DataFrames for equality.

To fix this bug, the canonicalization method should properly compare the block locations to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not wrongly classified as unequal.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.items())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue by properly comparing the block locations in the canonicalization function, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are classified as equal. This should make the `equals` function work correctly and pass the failing test.
