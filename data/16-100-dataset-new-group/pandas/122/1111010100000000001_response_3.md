The buggy function `equals` is part of the class `BlockManager` in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their attributes and data.

The potential error in the `equals` function is that it is comparing the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks, which can lead to incorrect comparisons if the blocks have different locations but the same content.

The cause of the bug is that the function uses the `mgr_locs` attribute for comparison, which might not be a reliable indicator of equality between blocks.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic to ensure that it compares the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations. This can be achieved by comparing the values directly instead of relying on the `mgr_locs` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of blocks is based on their content using the `equals` method, ensuring a more reliable equality check.
