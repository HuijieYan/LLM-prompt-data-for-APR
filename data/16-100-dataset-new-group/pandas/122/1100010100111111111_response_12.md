The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test to fail. The function is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks of the DataFrames. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on type name and manager locations, but it's not taking into account that the order of the blocks may differ.

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks needs to be modified to account for the different order of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly, not using canonicalize
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function directly compares the blocks of the DataFrames without sorting them, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values while resolving the GitHub issue.
