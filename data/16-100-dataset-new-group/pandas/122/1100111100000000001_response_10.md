The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager objects and should return True if they are equal, otherwise False.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the length of self_axes and other_axes may not accurately determine if the BlockManagers are equal, as they may have the same length but different contents.
2. The use of `_consolidate_inplace` may modify the state of the BlockManager objects.
3. The canonicalization of block order may not be correct, leading to incorrect comparison results.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not accurately compare the BlockManagers for equality, and the use of `_consolidate_inplace` may have unintended consequences.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `equals` function and remove any potential side effects caused by `_consolidate_inplace`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks[:]
    other_blocks = other.blocks[:]

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In the corrected version, we compare the lengths and the contents of `self_axes` and `other_axes` separately. We also create copies of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists to avoid unintended side effects. Then we sort and compare the blocks using the `canonicalize` function to ensure an accurate comparison.
