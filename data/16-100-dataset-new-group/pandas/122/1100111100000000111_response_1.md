Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue is related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method incorrectly returning True in the case of identical blocks with different locations. The problem lies within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, specifically in the sorting and comparison of blocks.

The bug causes the `equals` method to return True when it should actually return False, as demonstrated in the GitHub issue example. This is due to the incorrect comparison of blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `canonicalize` function needs to be revised to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block content instead of just locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.index)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the values and index of the blocks for comparison. This should ensure that the `equals` method correctly compares the content of the blocks, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report.
