The buggy function `equals` is used to determine if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. The function fails the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` which compares two dataframes `df1` and `df2` and expects them to be not equal.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The comparison logic to check if all axes are equal
2. The sorting and comparison logic for the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly comparing the axes and blocks of the `BlockManager` instances, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for axes and blocks needs to be implemented correctly, and the function should return `False` when the compared objects are not equal in both axes and blocks.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function compares the axes and blocks properly, and returns `False` if the compared `BlockManager` instances are not equal.
