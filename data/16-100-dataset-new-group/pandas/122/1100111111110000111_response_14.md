To fix the buggy function, we need to address the issue with the DataFrame equals() method that wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations. This can be done by modifying the implementation of the equals() method.

The problem with the current implementation of the equals() method is that it is not properly handling the comparison of DataFrames when the blocks are at different locations. In the failing test function, when comparing two DataFrames with different values but the same keys, the equals() method incorrectly returns True.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the equals() method in the BlockManager class to properly handle the comparison of the blocks in DataFrames. We can achieve this by ensuring that the comparison takes into account the order and location of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the equals() method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._consolidate_inplace(), id(block)))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._consolidate_inplace(), id(block)))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, we use the _consolidate_inplace() method to ensure that the blocks are properly consolidated before comparison. We also use the unique identifier of each block (id(block)) to handle the comparison based on block location.

This fix should address the bug and ensure that the equals() method returns the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks at different locations.

With this corrected version, the failing test function should now pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
