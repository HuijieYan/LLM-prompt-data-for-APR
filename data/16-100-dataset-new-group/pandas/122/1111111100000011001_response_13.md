The bug in the given function seems to be due to the incorrect handling of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes. The function attempts to compare the blocks using the `equals` method, but the blocks are not being sorted properly, which may lead to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a function to canonically sort the blocks
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, we ensure that the blocks are sorted before comparison, which should address the bug and lead to the expected behavior for the given test cases.
