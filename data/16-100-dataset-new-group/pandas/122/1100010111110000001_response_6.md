The bug in the given code is causing the `equals` method to return an incorrect value, resulting in a failing test.

The bug is likely due to the fact that the `equals` method is not implemented correctly, causing it to return an incorrect result when comparing two DataFrames.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the `equals` method to properly compare the DataFrames and return the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return False
    
    if self.shape != other.shape or (self.columns != other.columns).any():
        return False
    
    for col in self.columns:
        if (self[col] != other[col]).any():
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected method compares the shape and columns of the DataFrames, and then iterates through each column to compare their values. If any discrepancies are found, it returns `False`, otherwise it returns `True`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
