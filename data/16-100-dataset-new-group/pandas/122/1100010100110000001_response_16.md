The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, and the assertion evaluated to `True is False`. This means that the `equals` method is not working as expected and returning `True` instead of the expected `False`. 

The potential error location is in the `equals` method where the comparison logic is implemented. 

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not properly comparing the dataframes and returning the correct result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic in the `equals` method correctly compares the dataframes and returns the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, type(self)):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method will fix the bug and ensure that the comparison of dataframes returns the expected result.
