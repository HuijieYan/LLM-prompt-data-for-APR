The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class causes it to return `True` incorrectly in cases where identical blocks have different locations. This issue is reported on GitHub under the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The buggy function attempts to compare two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are of the same length and if all the axes are equal. However, it fails to properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `equals` function to also compare the actual blocks within the `BlockManager` for equality. This comparison should involve sorting the blocks based on a consistent criterion and then iterating through the sorted blocks to check for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function includes a proper comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager`. It sorts the blocks based on a consistent criterion using the `canonicalize` function and then iterates through the sorted blocks to check for equality.

By implementing this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and return the correct value of `False` when comparing the provided `DataFrame` objects in the test function.
