The bug in the `equals` function is causing the assertion error in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The function is incorrectly comparing dataframes and returning `True` instead of `False` when the dataframes are not equal.

The potential error location is in the `equals` method where the comparison logic is implemented. It seems that after sorting the blocks, the `equals` method is not properly comparing the block contents and returning the correct result.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function. The failing test clearly expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but the function is returning `True` instead.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to carefully compare each block of data in the dataframes and ensure that the comparison returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function should properly compare the blocks within the dataframes and return the expected result.
