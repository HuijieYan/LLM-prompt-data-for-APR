The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, specifically with the sorting operation and the comparison using the `equals` method.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, which leads to the failure of the subsequent comparison. Additionally, the variable `block` is being used without being defined within the `equals` function, potentially causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` correctly and also define the variable `block` within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
