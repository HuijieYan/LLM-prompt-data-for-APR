The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. It is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects, which are used in the internals of pandas to manage the blocks of data within a DataFrame.

The error message from the failing test states that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` has failed. It is indicating that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting of these blocks might not be producing the expected result and hence leading to the comparison failure.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of the internal data blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The sorting method used for canonicalizing the block order might be inconsistently producing different orders due to data types or unconsolidated blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the canonicalization and sorting logic to ensure a consistent order and comparison of the internal data blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the block's data type and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple of the block's values and its data type name. This should provide a consistent and meaningful canonical order for comparison. The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on this canonical order, and then the blocks are compared in the `all` function to determine equality. This should address the bug and make the function return the correct result for the failing test.
