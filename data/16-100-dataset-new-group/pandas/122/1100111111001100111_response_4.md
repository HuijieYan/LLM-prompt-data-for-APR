The buggy function `equals` is failing to properly compare DataFrames and is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This issue is reported on GitHub, and the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is failing.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. Incorrect comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
2. Incorrect sorting of block values that leads to wrong comparison results.

When analyzing Case 1 runtime values and types, it's evident that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This leads to the failing test.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to modify the sorting and comparison logic for `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` in the `canonicalize` function. This can be done by introducing a new sorting key based on the block's content, dtype, and locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block._get_values())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly compare DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations and pass the failing test case.
