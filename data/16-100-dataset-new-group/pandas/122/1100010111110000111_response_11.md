The error is raised by the `equals` method within the `Dataframe` class in pandas. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two dataframes `df1` and `df2` where the values in 'a' and 'b' columns of `df1` are of different data types compared to `df2`, which should result in the `equals` method returning False. However, the method incorrectly returns True, leading to a failing test.

The source of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not properly ordering the blocks before comparing them. This leads to the equals method incorrectly returning True when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the `canonicalize` function to ensure that blocks are properly ordered based on their data type and location, so that the comparison is accurate and returns the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method will properly compare the dataframes based on the data type and location of the blocks, and should return False for the failing test case provided.
