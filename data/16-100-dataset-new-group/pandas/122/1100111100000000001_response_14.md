The potential error location in the buggy function is the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` after the `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` calls. It seems that the `self._consolidate_inplace()` should not be called before the comparison.

The cause of the bug is that the `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` functions are being called before the comparison, which could potentially modify the blocks and cause the comparison to be inaccurate.

To fix the bug, the `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` calls should be removed from the `equals` function and the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` should be done before any modification is made to the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
