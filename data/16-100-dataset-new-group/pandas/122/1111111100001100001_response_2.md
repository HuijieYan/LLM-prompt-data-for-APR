The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class to check if they are equal. The bug is likely in the comparison logic or in the data provided for comparison.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables:
- Both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are tuples containing multiple blocks of different types (IntBlock and ObjectBlock) with different slice values and dtypes.
- The comparison logic uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs` values before comparing them. The `mgr_locs` values are derived from the `block` object and used to create a tuple for comparison.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks and potentially the sorting of the blocks using `canonicalize`.

To fix the bug:
- Ensure that the comparison logic between the blocks is accurate and can handle different block types and dtypes correctly.
- Verify the `canonicalize` function to ensure it correctly captures the properties needed for block comparison.
- Check if the comparison logic should consider the order of the blocks in addition to their content.

Below is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is removed, and the sorting of the blocks is done using a lambda function to capture the type name and `mgr_locs` for comparison. This should provide a more reliable comparison of the blocks.
