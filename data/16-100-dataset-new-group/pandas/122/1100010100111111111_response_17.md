The issue in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks in different locations within the `BlockManager`. This causes the function to return `True` incorrectly. The error message indicates that the comparison is resulting in `assert True is False`, which is not intended. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks based on their content rather than their location.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content, using a tuple combining the block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison logic now focuses on comparing the values of the blocks rather than their locations.

This corrected version of the function should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the comparison of DataFrame blocks accurately determines equality, resolving the bug reported.
