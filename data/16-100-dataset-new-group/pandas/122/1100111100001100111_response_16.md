## Bug Cause and Strategy for Fixing

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison of block locations when checking for equality between two `BlockManager` objects using the `equals` function. The `equals` function calls the `_consolidate_inplace` function, which may be causing issues with the comparison of the block locations.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the block locations are handled properly and consistently when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. This may involve modifying the logic for comparing the block locations and potentially the `_consolidate_inplace` function.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Check if the blocks are consolidated and sort them based on their dtype and mgr_locs
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)  # Removing the unnecessary conversion to a list

    # Sort the blocks based on canonicalization
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check if all the sorted blocks are equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we remove the unnecessary conversion of `mgr_locs` to a list in the `canonicalize` function and update the comparison logic to properly handle block locations. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
