The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is not correctly checking if two DataFrames are equal. The issue seems to be related to how the function is sorting and comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling cases where the ordering of the columns in the DataFrames is different. This leads to the function incorrectly returning `True` for DataFrames with different column orders, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to sort the columns in each block before comparing them in the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test provided.
