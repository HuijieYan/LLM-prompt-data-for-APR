## Explaining the bug
The buggy function `equals` is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects, then consolidates them in place before comparing the blocks. However, the bug causes the comparison to return `True` even if the blocks are in different locations. This behavior is not expected and results in failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The bug is due to the use of `canonicalize` to sort the blocks for comparison. The `canonicalize` function considers only the dtype name and `mgr_locs` to identify and sort the blocks. This approach fails to take into account blocks with the same dtype but different locations, leading to the comparison returning `True` erroneously.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider the full information of each block. This would include both the dtype and the actual values within the block to accurately identify and sort the blocks for comparison.

Additionally, we should also remove the redundant comparison for the number of blocks, as this check is already implicitly performed during the block comparison.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block, block.mgr_locs))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
With these updates, the `equals` function now considers the full information of each block for sorting, ensuring that blocks with identical contents but different locations are correctly identified and compared.
