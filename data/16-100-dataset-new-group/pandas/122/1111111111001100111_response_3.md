The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `df3.equals(df4)` test to fail. The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances and return `True` if they are equal, but it is wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The bug seems to stem from the `canonicalize` function. The `equals` function first sorts the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using `canonicalize`, but `canonicalize` uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` without any reference to `self` or `other`. This results in identical blocks with different locations being mistakenly flagged as equal.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary `canonicalize` function from the `equals` function.
2. Sort and compare `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` directly using a custom comparison function that takes into account the difference in block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly using a custom comparison function
    def block_equals(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly return `False` for the failing test `df3.equals(df4)`. This addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
