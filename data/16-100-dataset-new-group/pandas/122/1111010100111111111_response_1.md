The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test to return a value of `True` when it should return `False`, as indicated in the GitHub issue. Upon analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the bug lies in the comparison of the blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks in `self` and `other`. This is evident from the error message, which indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`. Additionally, based on the runtime input/output and expected input/output values, it is clear that the block comparison is not functioning as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison is done correctly. One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `equals` method to first check if the block counts are the same before going into the block-wise comparison. This would involve checking if the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is the same, and only proceeding with the block-wise comparison if this condition is met.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Checking block-wise comparison only if the block counts are the same
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method first checks if the block counts are the same. If they are, it proceeds with the block-wise comparison and returns `False` if any blocks do not equal each other. Otherwise, it returns `True` if all comparisons are successful. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
