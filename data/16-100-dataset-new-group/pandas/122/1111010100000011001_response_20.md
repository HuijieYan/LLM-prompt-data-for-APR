The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists. The comparison is intended to check if the blocks are equal, but there seems to be an issue with how the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks.

The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs to distinguish between unconsolidated blocks. However, the bug might be caused by the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function or the usage of the `sorted` function to compare the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks and the comparisons between individual blocks are correct.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check if the sorted blocks are equal
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple by converting the dtype to a string and using the `as_array` method of `mgr_locs`.
2. The blocks are sorted using the corrected `canonicalize` function.
3. The sorted blocks are then compared in a loop to ensure their equality.
4. The function returns `True` if all comparisons are successful, indicating that the `self` and `other` objects are equal.
