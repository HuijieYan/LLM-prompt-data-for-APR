Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The bug may be causing identical blocks with different locations to incorrectly return `True` when compared using the `equals` function.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, and the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` does not take into account the block locations, leading to incorrect equality checks. Additionally, the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function may not properly differentiate blocks with the same type but different locations.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block locations and update the equality check for blocks to consider their locations as well.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block locations when creating the tuple for comparison. Additionally, the comparison of blocks is performed in a loop, checking each block's equality based on its location-aware canonicalized representation.

These changes should fix the bug that caused the `equals` function to wrongly return `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue.
