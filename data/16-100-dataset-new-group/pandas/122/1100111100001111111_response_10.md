## Fixing the bug

From the analysis, it seems that the bug occurs when comparing identical blocks with different locations. The issue is related to the sorting of the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. The buggy function does not handle this case correctly, leading to incorrect results. To fix this bug, the canonicalization process for blocks needs to be updated to include the comparison of manager locations.

## Corrected Version

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to include manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes an updated `canonicalize` function that now includes the manager locations when sorting the blocks. This should resolve the issue and ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly handled in the `equals` function.

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include manager locations, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now return the correct result for the failing test case provided in the GitHub issue.
