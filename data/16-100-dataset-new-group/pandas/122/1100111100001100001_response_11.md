The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. Based on the provided runtime values, the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` seems to be correct, as well as the comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. Additionally, the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a custom function `canonicalize` and then comparing each pair of corresponding blocks appears to be the source of the problem.

The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once at the class level and once inside the `equals` function. This leads to ambiguity and potential incorrect order manipulation of the blocks. Furthermore, the `as_array` attribute of `mgr_locs` is used incorrectly which results in a `AttributeError` when called as a method.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the duplicated definition of `canonicalize` inside the `equals` function.
2. Fix the usage of `as_array` by accessing it as an attribute instead of a method.
3. Ensure that the `canonicalize` function is defined correctly and returns a tuple.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the function should no longer produce erroneous results and behave as expected when comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
