## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of dataframe axes using `self.axes` and `other.axes`.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which is using the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block.

## Explain the cause of the bug
The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return True even when the dataframes have identical blocks with different locations. The bug is due to the incorrect comparison of axes and the sorting of blocks based on `mgr_locs` attribute, which causes the comparison to be inaccurate.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of axes is accurate, and the sorting of blocks is done based on the correct criteria. This may involve modifying the `canonicalize` function and ensuring that the comparison of axes is based on the actual content of the axes rather than their object references.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = [tuple(ax) for ax in self.axes], [tuple(ax) for ax in other.axes]
        
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and the actual data in the block to ensure accurate comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.get_values().tobytes())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By converting the axes to tuples and comparing their actual content, and sorting the blocks based on the actual data in the block, this corrected version of the function should address the bug and ensure accurate comparison of dataframes.
