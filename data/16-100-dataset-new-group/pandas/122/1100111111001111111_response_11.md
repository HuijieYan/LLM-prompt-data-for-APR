Based on the information provided, it appears that the bug in the equals function is due to the incorrect comparison of block order. The function wrongly returns True in cases of identical blocks with different locations. This is due to the sorting of blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs, causing the function to return True even when the two DataFrames are not equal.

To fix the bug, the sorting of blocks should be modified to ensure that the comparison is based on the actual data rather than the block order. Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [self.blocks[ax] for ax in self_axes]
    other_blocks = [other.blocks[ax] for ax in other_axes]

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are extracted based on the axes of the DataFrames, and the comparison is performed directly on the extracted blocks rather than sorting them based on dtype.name and mgr_locs.

This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the equals function behaves as expected, returning False in cases of identical blocks with different locations.
