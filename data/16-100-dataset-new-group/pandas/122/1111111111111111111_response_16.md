Based on the information provided, it seems that the `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False` for two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, which are not equal. This issue is related to block locations being different in the two DataFrames, resulting in the `equals` function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

The bug seems to be caused by the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the canonicalize function, and then checking for equality block by block. However, this approach fails when the block locations are different even though the blocks themselves are equal.

To fix this bug, we should revisit the `equals` function and modify the equality check process to handle cases where the blocks have different locations but are still equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check equality block by block
    for sblk, oblk in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not sblk.equals(oblk):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function directly loops through each block in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, checking for equality using the `equals` method for each block. This approach ensures that the equality check properly handles cases where the block locations are different but the blocks themselves are equal.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly return `False` for the provided failing test case, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
