The buggy function is the `equals` method from the `managers.py` module in the `pandas.core.internals` package. The function is used to compare two internal structures of Pandas objects.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. It's possible that the sorting logic is causing the comparison to fail.

The bug is causing the assertion error in the failing test because the `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to create a more unique and consistent sorting key that accurately represents the blocks. This will ensure that the comparison between the blocks of `self` and `other` is accurate and leads to the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then
    # mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks (say, Categorical)
    # which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(), block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now uses a combination of `mgr_locs` and `values` to uniquely identify and sort the blocks, ensuring that the comparison between `self` and `other` produces the correct result.
