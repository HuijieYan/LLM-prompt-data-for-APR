The buggy function `equals` is attempting to compare two DataFrames `self` and `other` using the `equals()` method, but it's encountering an assertion error that indicates `True is False`, implying that the comparison is resulting in `True` instead of `False` as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison between `self` and `other` DataFrames is not producing the expected result. This could be due to the incorrect implementation of the comparison logic within the buggy function.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to be reviewed and potentially rewritten to ensure that it correctly compares the two DataFrames and returns the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods and class attributes)

    def equals(self, other):
        if self.shape != other.shape:
            return False
        if self.columns.tolist() != other.columns.tolist():
            return False
        if not self.values.tolist() == other.values.tolist():
            return False
        return True
```

In this corrected version of the `equals` function for the `BlockManager` class, the logic has been updated to compare the shapes, columns, and values of the two DataFrames `self` and `other` to determine their equality. This fixed logic should address the issue identified in the failing test.
