The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal. The function first checks if the number of axes in both objects is the same, and if the axes themselves are equal. Then, it consolidates the blocks within each `BlockManager` object and compares the number of blocks. Finally, it sorts and compares the individual blocks.

The failing test is comparing two `DataFrame` objects, `df1` and `df2`, using the `equals` method. The test fails with the error message `E       assert True is False`, indicating that the `equals` method returns `True` incorrectly.

The buggy function takes two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`, and inspects their `axes` and `blocks` attributes.

A potential error location is in the sorting and comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. There might be an issue with the sort order of the blocks that causes the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should use a more robust comparison approach for the underlying blocks. This could involve a deep comparison of the block contents or a different strategy for canonicalizing and comparing blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.get_blocks()
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the function, after consolidating the blocks, we retrieve the individual blocks using the `get_blocks` method. Then we directly compare each block using the `equals` method, ensuring that a correct comparison is performed.

This corrected approach should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected for the failing test.
