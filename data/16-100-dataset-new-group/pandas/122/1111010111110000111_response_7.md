Based on the provided information, here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # iteratively compare the blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

Explanation:
1. The original code was intended to compare each block independently by iterating through the blocks. However, the faulty implementation sorted the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, causing incorrect behavior when comparing different instances with the same data but different block order.

2. The corrected version iterates through the blocks of the 'self' and 'other' objects and compares each block individually. If any block is found to not be equal, it returns False immediately. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that all blocks are equal.

3. This modification to the function address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

By using this corrected version of the `equals` function, the incorrect comparison behavior will be resolved, and the failing test case will pass as expected.
