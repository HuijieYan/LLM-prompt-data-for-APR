The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `DataFrame.equals` method to return `True` incorrectly for DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly taking into account the block locations when comparing the DataFrames. It compares the blocks without considering their locations, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks while considering their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks including their locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the comparison of block locations in the `equals` function, we ensure that the function considers the blocks' actual positions and correctly identifies differences. This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
