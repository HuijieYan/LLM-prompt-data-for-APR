The buggy function 'equals' is defined within the BlockManager class in the 'pandas/core/internals/managers.py' file. This function is meant to compare two instances of BlockManager for equality, but it is failing for the test case provided. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is the reason for the failure.

The buggy function attempts to compare two BlockManager instances by first comparing their axes, then consolidating the instances, and finally comparing their blocks. However, there are a few issues within the function:

1. The function attempts to compare block equality without checking if the number of blocks in the instances is the same.
2. It calls the `canonicalize` function, but the implementation of this function has a bug where the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` should be called as `block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()`.
3. The function does not handle the case when the number of blocks is different between the two instances.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be updated to first check if the number of blocks in both instances is the same before performing the comparison. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to correct the call to `as_array`. Finally, the canonicalized blocks can be compared directly after sorting and canonicalizing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
  
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

def canonicalize(self, block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
```

With these updates, the `equals` function should now perform the comparison correctly and pass the failing test.
