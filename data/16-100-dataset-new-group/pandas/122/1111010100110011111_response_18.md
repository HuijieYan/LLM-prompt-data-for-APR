## Correction to the Buggy Function

To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue of identical blocks with different locations returning `True` instead of `False`. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on the type name and the locations before comparing them for equality. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # ... (other class code remains unchanged) ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Sort blocks based on type name and locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now sorts the blocks based on the type name and locations before comparing them for equality. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and accurately return `False` for cases where identical blocks with different locations are compared.
