The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test, as it is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that should be considered different. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames, and the canonicalization process to order the blocks for comparison.

The cause of the bug could be related to the sorting and comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. It seems that the sorting function `canonicalize` might be working incorrectly when trying to order the blocks for comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of the blocks in both DataFrames is consistent and correct. This can be achieved by properly identifying and ordering the blocks to make sure that the comparison of equivalent blocks returns `True`, while the comparison of different blocks returns `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the type of the block and the `mgr_locs` attribute. This should ensure that equivalent blocks are ordered consistently for comparison, leading to a correct result when comparing the DataFrames.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and return the expected result of `False` for the given input DataFrames.
