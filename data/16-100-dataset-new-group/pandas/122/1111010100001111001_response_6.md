The bug in the provided function "equals" of the "BlockManager" class is that it is not comparing the "blocks" attribute correctly. The function compares the length of the blocks and the axes correctly, but when it comes to comparing the actual blocks, it does not handle the comparison appropriately, especially the "mgr_locs" attribute within the "block" object.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic should be modified to ensure that it correctly handles the comparison of all relevant attributes in the "blocks".

Here's a corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
	    if not block.equals(oblock):
	        return False
    return True
```

In the corrected version, I added a loop that iterates through the blocks and checks if each block in in "self_blocks" is equal to its corresponding block in "other_blocks". This loop guarantees that all the relevant attributes within the blocks are compared correctly.
