The bug in the `equals` function seems to be due to the comparison of blocks with different locations. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, but it doesn't take into account the block locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the comparison. Additionally, the sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` needs to be updated to properly consider the block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs to compare block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function takes into account the block locations when comparing blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are treated as unequal, which resolves the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue.
