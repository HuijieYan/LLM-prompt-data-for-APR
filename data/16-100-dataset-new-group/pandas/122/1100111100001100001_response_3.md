The bug in the equals function seems to be related to the comparison and sorting of blocks within the BlockManager object. 

The function first checks if the number of axes in the 'self' variable is different from the number of axes in the 'other' variable. If they are different, it returns False. Then it checks if each axis of 'self' is equal to the corresponding axis of 'other', and if not, it returns False. 

After that, it calls the _consolidate_inplace function on both 'self' and 'other' BlockManager objects. Then it checks if the number of blocks in 'self' is equal to the number of blocks in 'other'. If not, it returns False.

The function then defines a nested function called canonicalize, which is used to sort the blocks in both 'self' and 'other' based on their data type and placement. It then sorts the blocks using this canonicalize function and compares each block in 'self' with the corresponding block in 'other'. 

Based on this analysis, it seems that the issue may lie in the sorting of the blocks using the canonicalize function, as well as the comparison of the sorted blocks.

To fix the bug, we can modify the canonicalize function to return a unique identifier for each block, and then use that identifier for sorting. We can also ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # define a function to generate a unique identifier for each block
    def get_block_id(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_id)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_id)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we define a new function called get_block_id that generates a unique identifier for each block based on its values and mgr_locs. We then use this identifier to sort the blocks in 'self' and 'other'. Finally, we compare the sorted blocks to determine if the two BlockManager objects are equal.
