### Bug analysis
The purpose of the `equals` function is to compare two DataFrames and return `True` if they have the same element values and number of the elements. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is incorrectly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Error location
The potential error in the function lies in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. It seems that the sorting is not taking into account the order of the elements within the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug cause
The cause of the bug is that when sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, the order of the elements within the blocks is not a factor in the sorting process. This can lead to identical blocks with different element locations being considered equal, resulting in an incorrect `True` return value.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the order of the elements within the blocks is considered during the sorting process. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the element values in addition to the type name and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and element values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, the `canonicalize` function now includes the `block.values` to ensure that the element values are considered during the sorting process. This change will address the bug and ensure that identical blocks with different element locations are not incorrectly considered equal.
