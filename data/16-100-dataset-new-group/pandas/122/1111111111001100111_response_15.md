The issue reported on GitHub reflects a bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library. The bug causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

After analyzing the provided code and test case, it's clear that the bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of the block locations within the `equals` method. When comparing the blocks, there is no consideration for the actual data within the blocks, instead, only the block locations are being compared. This results in an incorrect `True` return for the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`, where two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are incorrectly identified as equal.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to compare the actual data within the blocks, rather than just the block locations. This can be achieved by iterating through the blocks and comparing their contents rather than relying only on the block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` method compares the actual data within the blocks by sorting the blocks based on their values and then comparing them.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, and the corrected version of the `equals` method should correctly identify the two DataFrames as not equal.
