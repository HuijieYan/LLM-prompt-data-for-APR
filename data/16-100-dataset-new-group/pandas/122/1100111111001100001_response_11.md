#### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, there are several issues that could be causing it to fail:

1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` is not sufficient to determine equality since these are lists of axes, not the actual data to compare.
2. The call to `_consolidate_inplace` on both `self` and `other` may be modifying the blocks, causing unexpected changes in the comparison.
3. The `canonicalize` function may not be implemented correctly, leading to incorrect sorting of blocks.
4. The sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` may not be accurate.

#### Bug Fix Strategy
Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
1. Instead of comparing `self_axes` and `other_axes`, the actual data should be compared. This can be done by iterating over the axes and comparing the values.
2. Avoid calling `_consolidate_inplace` in the `equals` function, as it may modify the blocks and affect the comparison.
3. Ensure that the `canonicalize` function accurately represents the block and is used to sort blocks for comparison.
4. Review the sorting and comparison logic to ensure that it accurately compares the blocks.

#### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self.axes)):
        if not self.axes[i].equals(other.axes[i]):
            return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_data.sort(key=self.canonicalize)
    other_data.sort(key=other.canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_block, other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_data, other_data)
    )

# Modify the canonicalize function to properly represent the block
def canonicalize(self, block):
    return (block.values.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))
```

This corrected version compares the actual data within the blocks, uses a modified `canonicalize` function to represent the block, and ensures that no unexpected modifications are made to the blocks during comparison.
