The buggy function `equals` appears to be comparing two dataframes to check if they are equal. The function compares the axes of the dataframes and the blocks within the dataframes. However, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but this assertion is failing.

The potential error location within the buggy function could be in the block comparison section. It seems that the function does not handle the case where the values within the blocks are compared. This could be the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to also compare the values within the blocks of the dataframes. The comparison should not only check if the block structures are the same but also if the values within the blocks are the same.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the blocks by checking both the structure and values
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, it should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
