To fix the bug in the equals function, it appears that the issue stems from a potential inconsistency in comparing blocks due to differences in their locations. The canonicalize function is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs, but this may not accurately capture the uniqueness of the blocks.

One potential strategy to fix the bug is to enhance the canonicalize function to include additional attributes that ensure the uniqueness of each block. This might involve incorporating more block-specific attributes or using a different approach to sort and compare the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the canonicalize function has been updated to include the block values as well, which should help ensure the uniqueness of each block. This modification should address the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected output for the equals function when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks located differently.
