The buggy function `equals` has a few potential error locations that need to be addressed. One issue arises from the comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes`, wherein the buggy function checks if they have the same length, but it doesn't account for the order of the axes or the actual data within them. Another potential issue is the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, which could lead to incorrect results.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it instead returns `True`, leading to an assertion error.

The bug described in the GitHub issue also aligns with the failing test case, indicating that the `equals` function is not returning the expected output.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be updated to compare the data within the axes and blocks, rather than just their lengths or ordering.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Compare the data within the axes
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare the data within the blocks
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version compares the data within the axes and blocks, ensuring that the function returns the expected output.

With this fix, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, as well as the GitHub issue.
