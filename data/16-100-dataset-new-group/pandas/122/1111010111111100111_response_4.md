The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class does not compare the data blocks correctly, leading to incorrect results when comparing two DataFrames.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect implementation of how the data blocks are compared in the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to compare the data blocks using a different approach that ensures the correct comparison of the underlying data.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Ensure the correct comparison of the data blocks
    for block_loc in self._data:
        if block_loc not in other._data or not self._data[block_loc].equals(other._data[block_loc]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the data blocks of the `BlockManager` instances, ensuring that the comparison is done correctly.

By using this corrected version, the failing test should pass, and the issue on GitHub should be resolved.
