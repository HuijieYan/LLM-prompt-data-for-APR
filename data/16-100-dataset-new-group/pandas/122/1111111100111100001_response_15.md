The bug in the `equals` function is that it is comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` directly without ensuring that the blocks are properly sorted and consolidated. This can lead to incorrect comparisons when the blocks are not in the same order or have different data types.

To fix the bug, the function should consolidate the blocks before comparing them, ensuring that they are in a consistent order and with the correct data types.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_consolidated = self.copy(deep=False)
    self_consolidated._consolidate_inplace()
    
    other_consolidated = other.copy(deep=False)
    other_consolidated._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self_consolidated.blocks) != len(other_consolidated.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_consolidated.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_consolidated.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version first ensures that the axes of the two objects are equal, then consolidates the blocks of both objects before sorting and comparing them. This should fix the bug and make the function return correct results for the failing test.
