The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is not the expected behavior. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The comparison of block locations using `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` may not capture the actual equality of blocks with different locations.
2. The sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function does not account for blocks with different locations but identical content.

The cause of the bug lies in the fact that the function is not properly differentiating between blocks with identical content but different locations. This leads to the incorrect comparison and results in the `equals` function returning True when it should be False.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle blocks with different locations. Additionally, the comparison logic between the sorted blocks should be enhanced to consider both content and location.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Use a dictionary to store canonicalized block representations
        canonicalized_self_blocks = {}
        canonicalized_other_blocks = {}

        for block in self.blocks:
            canonicalized_repr = (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
            canonicalized_self_blocks[canonicalized_repr] = block

        for block in other.blocks:
            canonicalized_repr = (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
            canonicalized_other_blocks[canonicalized_repr] = block

        # Check for equality of blocks
        if len(canonicalized_self_blocks) != len(canonicalized_other_blocks):
            return False

        for key, block in canonicalized_self_blocks.items():
            if key not in canonicalized_other_blocks or not block.equals(canonicalized_other_blocks[key]):
                return False

        return True
```

In the corrected version, we use a dictionary to store the canonicalized representations of blocks, taking into account both content and location. We then compare the dictionaries to ensure that both `BlockManager` instances have the same blocks with the same content and location, returning True if they are equal.
