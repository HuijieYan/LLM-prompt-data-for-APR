## Solution:
The bug in the `equals()` function is caused by comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager` without considering the block's actual order. To fix this, we need to update the comparison logic to sort the blocks before making the comparison. Based on the provided details, a corrected version of the `equals()` function is provided below.

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a function to canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    # Sort the blocks based on the canonicalized representation
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected implementation, the `equals()` function now sorts the blocks based on a canonicalized representation and then compares the sorted blocks. This approach ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be appropriately compared, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

The corrected function ensures the expected input/output values and addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue.
