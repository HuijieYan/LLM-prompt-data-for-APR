The buggy function appears to be the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The purpose of this method is to check whether the BlockManager object is equal to another object or not.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the bug may be related to the comparison of the data blocks within the BlockManager. The function attempts to compare the blocks by sorting them based on their dtype name and manager locations and then comparing each pair of blocks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the axis lengths of the two BlockManager objects.
2. The comparison of the axes themselves.
3. The comparison of the data blocks within the BlockManager objects.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect comparison of the data blocks within the BlockManager object. The function is not handling the comparison of the data blocks accurately, leading to incorrect results when checking for equality between BlockManager objects.

A strategy for fixing the bug could be to ensure that the comparison of the data blocks within the BlockManager is correctly implemented. This may involve revisiting the logic for sorting and comparing the blocks to ensure that it accurately reflects the equality between the BlockManager objects.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare the data blocks based on dtype name and manager locations
    self_blocks = sorted(
        [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()) for block in self.blocks]
    )
    other_blocks = sorted(
        [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()) for block in other.blocks]
    )

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file.
