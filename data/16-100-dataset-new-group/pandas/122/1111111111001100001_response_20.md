The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. The function fails to return the correct result when comparing two `BlockManager` objects, causing the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()`. 

Based on the provided runtime values and the buggy function's code, it seems that the issue is with the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparing them. 

Potential cause of the bug:
1. The `canonicalize` function is not correctly defined within the `BlockManager` class, causing an error during the sorting process.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `canonicalize` function correctly within the `BlockManager` class to ensure it can be called and used properly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False

        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_tuple())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is defined within the `BlockManager` class and properly handles the block sorting process, resolving the issue that caused the failing test case.
