### Analysis
The `equals` function is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal. However, it fails to do so correctly, as confirmed by the GitHub issue where a simple test case fails to return the expected result.

The potential error locations include:
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
2. The sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison performed in the `canonicalize` function is not comprehensive enough to account for identical blocks with different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the `BlockManager` instances is comprehensive and accounts for identical blocks with different locations. We may need to rethink the approach to sorting and comparing the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a dictionary to hold the blocks of each BlockManager
    self_blocks_dict = {block.dtype.name: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks_dict = {block.dtype.name: block for block in other.blocks}

    # Check if the number of unique block types is the same
    if len(self_blocks_dict) != len(other_blocks_dict):
        return False

    # Check if each block in self exists in other
    for self_block_name, self_block in self_blocks_dict.items():
        if self_block_name not in other_blocks_dict:
            return False
        else:
            other_block = other_blocks_dict[self_block_name]
            if not self_block.equals(other_block):
                return False

    return True
```
In the corrected version, we use dictionaries to organize and compare the blocks of each `BlockManager`. This way, we ensure that blocks are compared comprehensively, and the comparison takes into account identical blocks with different locations.
