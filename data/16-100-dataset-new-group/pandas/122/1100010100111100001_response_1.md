The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects, but it has an issue. The function compares the axes of the two objects, followed by comparing their blocks. The issue arises when the function tries to compare the blocks. It uses a custom sorting function `canonicalize` to sort the blocks before comparing them. The bug is most likely located in the sorting process within the `canonicalize` function.

The provided error message indicates that the `assert` statement `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, and the assertion `assert True is False` is raised. This means that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, leading to the assertion failure.

The input and variable values provided indicate that both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` have the same layout and data, but the sorting process in the `canonicalize` function is causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to use a different approach to sort the blocks. This could involve comparing the content of the blocks directly, rather than trying to sort them based on their data types and locations. Additionally, the original comparison logic inside the `equals` function can be reviewed and validated to ensure it accurately compares the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the function skips the sorting step and directly compares the blocks for equality. This approach should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result for the failing test.
