The bug appears to be in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method. The function is not defined correctly within the class `BlockManager`, resulting in a reference to the outer function instead of the class method. This incorrect reference is likely causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method should be redefined using a correct reference to the class method. Additionally, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` could also be a problem, as the ordering for comparison may not be reliable. Refactoring the comparison step may help in resolving this concern.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (
            block.values,  # Consider all block values for canonicalization
            block.mgr_locs.indexer,  # Include the mgr_locs indexer
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been renamed to `canonicalize_block` to avoid confusion with the outer function. The sorting key for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` now includes the block values along with the `mgr_locs` indexer to ensure a reliable comparison.

With this correction, the `equals` method should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
