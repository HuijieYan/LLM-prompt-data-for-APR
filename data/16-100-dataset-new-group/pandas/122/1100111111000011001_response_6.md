The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrame objects `self` and `other` for equality. However, the function encounters a bug where it fails to correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames due to potential unconsolidated blocks (such as Categorical) that can only be distinguished by the iteration order. This leads to incorrect equality comparisons and causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function used to sort the blocks needs to be adjusted to take into account the unique characteristics of unconsolidated blocks. Additionally, the comparison logic for the blocks within the DataFrames needs to be improved to correctly evaluate equality.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Include unconsolidated blocks in the canonicalization
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._holder.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the unconsolidated blocks in the canonicalization and using a proper comparison logic, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output.
