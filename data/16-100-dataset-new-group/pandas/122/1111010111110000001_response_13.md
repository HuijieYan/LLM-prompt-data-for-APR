The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. It seems that the `equals` function is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. Comparing the individual axes of the two `BlockManager` instances may not yield the expected result.
2. The way the blocks are being sorted and compared may not be accurate.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not able to correctly determine the equality of the two `BlockManager` instances, resulting in the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the equality comparison of the two `BlockManager` instances is done correctly and consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Compare blocks in the same order
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that the axes are compared correctly, and the blocks are compared in the same order. This should address the issue and allow the `equals` function to correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances.
