The main issue with the provided code is that the `canonicalize` function is not handling the `block` object properly. The code is trying to access the properties of the `block` object directly without considering the actual data it contains.

We will fix this bug by updating the `canonicalize` function to properly extract the necessary information from the `block` object in order to compare it with the other `oblock` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the `canonicalize` function to extract the block type name and values, and use them to create a tuple for comparison.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output for the given input values.
