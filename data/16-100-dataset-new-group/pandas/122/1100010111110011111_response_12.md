The buggy function `equals` in `managers.py` is responsible for checking whether two dataframes are equal. However, it fails to handle the comparison correctly due to sorting issues with unconsolidated blocks.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with different values and checks that they are not equal. However, the assertion fails with the error message `assert True is False`, indicating that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

Based on the failing test, the expected input/output variable values, and the GitHub issue, the bug is caused by the `equals` function incorrectly sorting unconsolidated blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

To fix the bug, we should update the `canonicalize` function to handle unconsolidated blocks properly. We can achieve this by consolidating the blocks before sorting them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        block.consolidate()
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this updated version, the `equals` function correctly consolidates unconsolidated blocks using the `consolidate` method before sorting, ensuring that the comparison is consistent and accurate.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the `equals` function pass the failing test case.
