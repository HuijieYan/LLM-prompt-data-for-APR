The buggy function `equals` is comparing two dataframes and returning `True` instead of `False` when the dataframes are not equal. This is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to give an assertion error.

The cause of the bug is the logic in the `equals` function. When `df1` and `df2` are compared using the `equals` method, it is returning `True` instead of `False` as expected. This is because the buggy function is not correctly handling the comparison logic for two dataframes.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `equals` function to correctly compare the dataframes and return `False` when they are not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
