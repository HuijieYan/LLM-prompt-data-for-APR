The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return incorrect results. The function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the `self` and `other` BlockManager objects, which results in incorrect equality comparisons. Specifically, the bug is related to the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager objects.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly returns a unique identifier for each block, taking into account the block type and its locations within the block manager. Additionally, the sorting and comparison of the blocks should be handled with respect to the unique identifiers generated by the `canonicalize` function.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()  # Consolidate before comparison
    other._consolidate_inplace()  # Consolidate before comparison

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Function to generate unique identifier for a block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    # Sort the blocks based on unique identifiers
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function generates a unique identifier for each block, considering the type of the block and its locations within the block manager. Then, the blocks are sorted based on these unique identifiers, and the sorted blocks are compared to determine equality.

By making these changes, the corrected `equals` function should now perform the comparison of BlockManager objects properly, addressing the issue reported on GitHub and ensuring the expected output for the given test cases.
