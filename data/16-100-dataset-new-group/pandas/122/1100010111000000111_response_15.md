## The corrected version of the function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.shape, repr(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
The original buggy function has a logical error when comparing the blocks of the DataFrame. The issue on GitHub highlighted the problem that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in cases of identical blocks with different locations. When comparing the blocks, the buggy function only took into consideration the dtype name and mgr_locs, but did not consider the block shape and the representation of the block itself. This caused incorrect comparison results and led to failing tests.

To fix this, the corrected function includes the block shape and the representation of the block in the canonicalize function. The comparison has also been updated to ensure that there is a matching number of blocks between the two DataFrames before comparing each block.

With these modifications, the corrected function now addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures correct comparison of DataFrames.
