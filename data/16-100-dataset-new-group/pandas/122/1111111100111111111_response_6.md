The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class from the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is causing it to return True when it should be False, as demonstrated by the failing test case. The key issue arises from the `canonicalize` function being redefined within the `equals` function, leading to unexpected behavior.

The `canonicalize` function is supposed to be defined only once within the `BlockManager` class, but the redefinition within the `equals` function is causing the issue.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should only be defined once within the `BlockManager` class and should not be redefined within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using a distinct name, `canonicalize_block`, for the block canonicalization function within the `equals` function, we can avoid redefining the `canonicalize` function within the class, resolving the bug.
