The buggy function `equals` is failing to correctly identify whether two BlockManager objects are equal. The issue is caused by the comparison of the BlockManager's axes and blocks, and the canonicalization of the blocks. The actual cause seems to be that the canonicalize block order is not properly taking into account the type name and mgr_loc values.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function within the `equals` function needs to be updated to correctly compare the type name and mgr_loc values for each block. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks themselves needs to be adjusted to ensure that they are correctly identified as equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, str(block))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and correctly identify when two BlockManager objects are not equal.
