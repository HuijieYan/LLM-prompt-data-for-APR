The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. This is indicated by the error message from the failing test, which shows that the comparison of the two DataFrames is returning `True` instead of `False`.

The cause of the bug appears to be the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The sorting operation may not be preserving the relative order of the blocks as required by the comparison, resulting in an incorrect equality check.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to use a more appropriate key for sorting the blocks. Specifically, we should include the position of the block within the list of blocks as part of the sorting key to ensure that the block order is preserved.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (index, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted([(self.blocks[i], i) for i in range(len(self.blocks))], key=lambda x: canonicalize(*x))
    other_blocks = sorted([(other.blocks[i], i) for i in range(len(other.blocks))], key=lambda x: canonicalize(*x))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
