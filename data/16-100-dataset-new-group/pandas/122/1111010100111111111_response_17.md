The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class causes the function to wrongly return `True` instead of `False` when faced with identical blocks with different locations. This can be seen from the provided failing test and the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the function are the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, as well as the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which can lead to identical blocks with different locations being considered the same. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, the ordering of the blocks needs to be revised, ensuring that it takes into account the locations of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # check if blocks have the same types and locations
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if self.blocks[i].dtype != other.blocks[i].dtype:
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(self.blocks[i].mgr_locs.as_array, other.blocks[i].mgr_locs.as_array):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version introduces a loop to compare the types and locations of the blocks, ensuring that they are identical before returning `True`. This should address the bug and make the function return the expected result.
