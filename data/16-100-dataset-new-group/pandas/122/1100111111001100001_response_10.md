The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly compare the blocks in the `self` and `other` BlockManager instances due to a misimplementation of the `canonicalize` and `equals` methods. 

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be moved outside of the `equals` method and implemented in the `BlockManager` class. Additionally, the comparison of blocks should be done using their respective `mgr_locs` attribute and proper sorting.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other methods...
    
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With these changes, the `equals` method should now properly compare the BlockManager instances and pass the failing test.
