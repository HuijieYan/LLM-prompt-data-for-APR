The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the blocks are identical but have different locations. This causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` in some cases, leading to failing tests and issues reported in GitHub.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them for equality. We can achieve this by incorporating a comparison of block locations within the `canonicalize` function. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the lengths of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are different.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function now incorporates block locations in the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

This fix should address the reported bug and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes, and the expected input/output values are satisfied.
