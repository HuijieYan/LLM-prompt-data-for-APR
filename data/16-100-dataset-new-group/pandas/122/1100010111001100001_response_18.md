The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. 

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are equal using the `equals` method. The test fails, indicating that the `equals` method is not working properly.

In the provided runtime values, it can be observed that the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are being sorted using a custom key function `canonicalize`, which sorts the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs` attribute. The issue could be with the ordering of the blocks when comparing the two `BlockManager` objects.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, which might not be capturing the correct comparison criteria for the blocks. It is also possible that the block order is impacting the comparison result. 
2. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks of `self` and `other` are compared correctly. This could involve redefining the `canonicalize` function or the comparison process.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been replaced with a lambda function within the `sorted` calls. This lambda function sorts the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs` attribute, ensuring that the blocks are compared correctly during the `equals` process. This correction should address the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
