### Bug Explanation:

The issue is likely occurring due to the comparison of `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. This causes the function to return `True` instead of `False` in cases where the blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison logic inside the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on their data rather than their locations.
2. We can also ensure that the comparisons are performed based on the type and the data content of the blocks to achieve accurate results.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block data content, using the block's internal values
        def canonicalize_values(block):
            return block.values

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_values)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_values)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
