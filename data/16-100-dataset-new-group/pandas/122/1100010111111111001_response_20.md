The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. However, the function fails to handle the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`, resulting in the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

The specific issue arises from the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method, which does not properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` must be modified to ensure that the individual blocks are correctly compared for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block individually
    for block_name in self.blocks:
        if not self.blocks[block_name].equals(other.blocks[block_name]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version includes a loop to iterate through each block in the `BlockManager` and compare them individually using the `equals` method. This ensures that each block is compared correctly for equality, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
