The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should return `False` for the given test case. The error message indicates that the expected result is False, but the function is returning True.

The bug is likely in the block comparison part of the function, where it sorts and compares blocks from the two DataFrames. The bug may be due to incorrect comparison methods or the sorting process.

To fix the bug, we should verify the comparison and sorting process for the blocks. Additionally, we should check if any hidden state changes are occurring in the process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for idx in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[idx].equals(other_blocks[idx]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the function should satisfy the failing test, as well as the expected input/output values.
