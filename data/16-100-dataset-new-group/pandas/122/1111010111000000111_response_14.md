## Analysis:
- The buggy function is a method called `equals` in the `BlockManager` class located in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. This method is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances.
- The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` compares two DataFrames using the `equals` method and expects the result to be `False`.
- The GitHub issue describes a scenario where `equals` incorrectly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The canonicalization of block order using the `canonicalize` function could be causing blocks with identical elements in different positions to be considered as equal.

## Bug Cause:
- The `equals` method uses the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks, but this function does not take into account the element positions within the blocks.
- When two blocks have identical elements but are in different positions, the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To address this bug, the `canonicalize` function should take into account both the type name and the element positions within the blocks.
- After updating the canonicalization method, the `equals` method should correctly compare the blocks based on both type names and element positions.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the position of the elements within the blocks by converting `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to a tuple. This should ensure that the `equals` method correctly compares identical blocks with different locations and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
