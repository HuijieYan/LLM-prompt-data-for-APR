The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. It is designed to compare two block managers for equality.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` call is returning `True` when it should be `False`. This suggests that the equality comparison is not working as expected.

Analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function shows that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the block managers for equality, leading to an incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison between the blocks in `self` and `other` block managers is handled correctly. We also need to make sure that the ordering of the blocks is consistent for a proper comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        type(block) == type(oblock) and block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the comparison between the blocks is done using the `type` of the block and its `mgr_locs`. This allows us to compare blocks of the same type in a consistent and correct manner.
