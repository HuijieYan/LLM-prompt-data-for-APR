The bug in the `equals` function occurs due to the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function is comparing the blocks by their dtype and mgr_locs, which may not ensure a correct comparison of the blocks. Additionally, the block management methods `_consolidate_inplace` and `canonicalize` are being called, but they are not relevant to the comparison logic.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks should consider a more reliable method of comparison. The comparison can be improved by directly comparing the block values. Additionally, the unnecessary method calls should be removed from the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks directly
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].values.equals(other.blocks[i].values):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected function, the comparison of the block values has been added to directly compare the block contents. This will ensure a more accurate comparison between the `BlockManager` instances. Additionally, unnecessary method calls have been removed, providing a more efficient implementation.
