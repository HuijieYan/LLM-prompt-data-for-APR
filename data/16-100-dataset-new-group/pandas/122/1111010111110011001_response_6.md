The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class has a bug that causes it to return `True` instead of the expected `False` when comparing two dataframes. This bug leads to the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the contents of the dataframes. It compares the axes and the blocks of the `self` and `other` objects, but it fails to accurately compare the actual data. This leads to the incorrect result and triggers the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should not only compare the axes and blocks but also the values contained within those blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if list(self_axes) != list(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self_data = self.get_numeric_data()
    other_data = other.get_numeric_data()
    
    return self_data.equals(other_data)
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now compares the data within the dataframe blocks, and the failing test should pass.

This corrected version ensures that the comparison of the dataframes includes the content of the blocks, not just the axes and block metadata.
