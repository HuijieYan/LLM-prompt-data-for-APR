To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue where the function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

One potential error location is the comparison of the canonicalized blocks. The `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks, may not accurately capture the equality of blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with different block locations.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's data as part of the sorting criteria. This will ensure that blocks with different locations but identical data are correctly categorized as not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name, data, and then mgr_locs
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version, we have included the block's values as part of the sorting criteria in the `canonicalize` function. This ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly categorized as not equal. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes.
