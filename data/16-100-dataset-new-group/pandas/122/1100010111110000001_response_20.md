The cause of the bug is that the equals function is not properly handling the comparison of dataframes with different column orders. It is currently only comparing individual columns without regard to their positions, leading to a false positive when comparing dataframes with different column orders.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the equals function to consider the order of the columns in addition to their contents.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare column order
    if list(self.columns) != list(other.columns):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the equals function should now properly compare the order of columns as well as their contents. The failing test should now pass without any assertion errors.
