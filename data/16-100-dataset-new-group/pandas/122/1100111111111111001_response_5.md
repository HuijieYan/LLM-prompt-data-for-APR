The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the sorting method `sorted` inside the function, which attempts to sort the blocks based on a function `canonicalize` that is not properly defined. This leads to incorrect comparisons and the function returning unexpected results.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `canonicalize` function properly and ensure it correctly interprets and sorts the blocks. Then, we can use the sorted and canonicalized blocks to make valid comparisons.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function to properly sort and compare the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.shape, block.dtypes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `block.shape` and `block.dtypes` are used as the key for sorting the blocks, which ensures a proper comparison and enables correct functioning of the `equals` function.
