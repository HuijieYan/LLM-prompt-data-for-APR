The error in the `equals` function is caused by the comparison of two DataFrames with the same column names but different data types. The bug causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when comparing DataFrames with different data types.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to also take into account the data type of the block when sorting the blocks for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and dtype because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (e.g., Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will correctly return `False` when comparing DataFrames with the same column names but different data types. This will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function behave as expected.
