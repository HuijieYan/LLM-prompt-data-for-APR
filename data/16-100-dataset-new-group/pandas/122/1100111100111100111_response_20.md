The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. It appears that the sorting function `canonicalize` is not able to correctly identify the different locations of blocks, leading to an incorrect comparison.

The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple combining the type name and the `mgr_locs` of the block. However, it seems that the `mgr_locs` attribute does not accurately represent the location of the block in this context. As a result, when the blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function, the comparison in the `equals` function results in an incorrect True value.

To fix this bug, a potential strategy would be to modify the `canonicalize` function or introduce a different method to correctly identify and sort the blocks based on their actual locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # revised canonicalize function to correctly identify block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block), block.dtype.name)  # Use the block's id and type for sorting
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the block's id along with its type for sorting, the corrected `canonicalize` function ensures that blocks with different locations are correctly identified and sorted. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the `equals` function more robust.
