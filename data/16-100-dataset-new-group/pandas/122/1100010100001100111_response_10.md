The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects. This is resulting in a False negative during the comparison, leading to incorrect results being returned by the equals function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager objects is done correctly. The bug might be occurring because the logic for comparing the blocks is not handling the case where the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks now includes both the `mgr_locs` and the `values` of the block, to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered unequal. This should fix the bug and ensure that the equals function returns the expected results as described in the GitHub issue.
