The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal. The bug seems to be related to how the function is comparing the block data within the two BlockManager objects.

The bug is likely in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparison. It seems that the sorting logic is incorrect, leading to incorrect comparison results.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to review the logic in the `canonicalize` function and double-check how the blocks are being sorted.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares each block in the `BlockManager` objects, ensuring that the comparison is done correctly and returns the expected result.
