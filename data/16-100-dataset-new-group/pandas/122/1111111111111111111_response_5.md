The bug in the `equals` function is that it returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations, resulting in a false positive when comparing two DataFrames. This bug is causing the failing test in the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function, as it expects the result of `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`, but the actual result is `True`.

Looking at the runtime values of the input parameters and the variables inside the `equals` function, it seems that the bug occurs when comparing the blocks of the `self` and `other` objects, as the blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function. It's likely that the `canonicalize` function does not properly account for the differences in block locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations as well, so that blocks with the same data but different locations are still recognized as different. After that, the sorted lists of blocks should be compared, ensuring that the block locations are properly considered in the comparison as well.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update the canonicalize function to consider block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    # Sort the blocks using the updated canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the sorted lists of blocks along with their locations
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly handle comparisons of DataFrames with identical blocks but different block locations, resolving the issue posted in GitHub and passing the failing test.
