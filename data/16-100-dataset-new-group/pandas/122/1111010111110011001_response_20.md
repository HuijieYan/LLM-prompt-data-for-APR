In the given code, the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. It compares the axes and blocks of the two instances to determine if they are equal. However, the comparison of the blocks is flawed and leads to incorrect results. 

The bug occurs when the code tries to compare the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances. It sorts the blocks based on their dtype and `mgr_locs`, but it fails to consider the value of the blocks themselves.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the actual values of the blocks in the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, including the block values, dtype, and mgr_locs in the comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method will now consider both the dtype and actual values of the blocks when comparing the two instances. This should fix the bug and make the failing test case pass.
