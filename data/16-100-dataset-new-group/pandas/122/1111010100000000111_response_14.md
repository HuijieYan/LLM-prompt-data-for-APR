## Analysis:
- The `equals` function is used to compare two BlockManager instances for equality.
- The issue reported on GitHub describes that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function only compares the block contents and not their locations. This leads to a situation where the function returns `True` for BlockManagers with identical block contents but different locations, which is incorrect.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The `equals` function needs to be modified to consider not only the block contents but also their locations when comparing two BlockManagers. This can be achieved by including the block locations in the comparison process to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are treated as unequal.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Include block locations in the comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of the `block` and `oblock` now includes a check for the equality of their locations using the `mgr_locs.equals` method. This ensures that the function accurately determines the equality of BlockManagers, taking into account both the block contents and their locations.
