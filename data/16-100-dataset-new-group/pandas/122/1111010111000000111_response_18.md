The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations when comparing two DataFrames. The issue is reported on GitHub as "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The potential error locations within the buggy function are identified as:
1. Incorrect handling of block equality comparison.
2. Inefficient block canonicalization before comparison.

The bug is caused by the `equals` function when comparing DataFrames `df3` and `df4`, which contain identical blocks but at different locations. The function should return `False` as expected, but due to the way block canonicalization is handled, the comparison incorrectly returns `True`.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization strategy before comparison should be improved to correctly handle identical blocks at different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self._merge_sort_blocks()
    other_blocks = other._merge_sort_blocks()
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalization of blocks before comparison is improved by using the `_merge_sort_blocks` method to ensure that identical blocks at different locations are handled appropriately. This correction should address the issue and ensure that the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes as expected.
