The bug in the equals function is caused by the fact that it wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations. This means that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks, resulting in incorrect output.

The cause of the bug lies within the canonicalize function used to sort the blocks. The canonicalization process defines a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs. However, a key issue is that the mgr_locs for the blocks are not being properly compared, leading to the wrong evaluation of equality.

To fix this bug, the canonicalize function should be modified to properly compare the mgr_locs of the blocks. This can be done by ensuring that the mgr_locs are compared in a consistent manner, allowing for accurate sorting and comparison of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Fix the canonicalize function to compare mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the equals function will now properly compare the mgr_locs of the blocks and accurately determine their equality.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the equals function returns the correct result in the case of identical blocks with different locations.
