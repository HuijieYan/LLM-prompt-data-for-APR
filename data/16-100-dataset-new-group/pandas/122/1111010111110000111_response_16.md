The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is causing the DataFrame `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The potential error locations in the `equals` function include:
1. Comparing the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without considering the content of each axis.
2. Sorting and comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists without properly accounting for different block locations.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not accurately comparing the internal blocks of the DataFrames, causing the comparison to return `True` when it should return `False`. This is evidenced by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` where the comparison of two DataFrames with different content yields an unexpected result of `True`.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to accurately compare the internal blocks of the DataFrames. This can be achieved by modifying the comparison logic to properly handle identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block in the BlockManager
    for blk in self.blocks:
        if blk._can_hold_identifiers_and_holds_name:
            blk_ids = blk.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
            for oblck in other.blocks:
                if oblck._can_hold_identifiers_and_holds_name:
                    if blk.dtype.name == oblck.dtype.name and blk.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() == blk_ids:
                        if not blk.equals(oblck):
                            return False
                        break

    return True
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function should resolve the issue on GitHub and pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
