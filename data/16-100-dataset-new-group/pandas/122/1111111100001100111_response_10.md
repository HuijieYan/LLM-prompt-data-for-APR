The bug in the `equals` function is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to return True when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The issue seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames.

The problem occurs when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple of the block's dtype and `mgr_locs.tolist()` and uses it for sorting. However, when the block's locations are different but the contents are identical, this sorting may not produce the expected results, leading to a wrong comparison.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to use more unique attributes for identifying and sorting the blocks, ensuring that the block comparison is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modify the canonicalize function to create a unique identifier for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block), block.values_hash())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses a combination of the block's unique identifier (generated using `id(block)`) and the hash of the block's values (calculated using `block.values_hash()`) for sorting. This ensures that the sorting is not affected by the block's location but rather by its unique identifier and contents.

By making this change, the `equals` function should now accurately compare DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
