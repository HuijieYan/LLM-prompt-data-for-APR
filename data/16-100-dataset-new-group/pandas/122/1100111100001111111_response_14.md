## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the BlockManager class and once inside it. This causes confusion and results in the wrong `canonicalize` function being called, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should remove the duplicate `canonicalize` function from inside the BlockManager class and only use the one defined outside the class.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other functions from the same class

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
