## The buggy function and its relationship with related functions and failing test

The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module. This method is responsible for checking the equality of two instances of `BlockManager` by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, comparing the number of blocks, and then comparing the blocks themselves. 

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates the buggy behavior of the `equals` function by creating two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` where the values are of different types for the same columns. The expectation is that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False` because the two DataFrames are not equal, but the buggy function is not handling this case properly.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of axes is not handling cases where the axes are not equal.
2. The comparison of blocks is not considering the case where the values in the blocks are of different types.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not properly handling the case where the values for the same columns in two instances of `BlockManager` are of different types.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly handle the case where the values for the same columns in two `BlockManager` instances are of different types. This can be achieved by implementing a more robust comparison logic for the blocks.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
# Within the BlockManager class in pandas/core/internals/managers.py

class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # ... (other methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # Compare the blocks based on the type and mgr_locs
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if str(type(block)) != str(type(oblock)) or not block.equals(oblock):
                return False
        
        return True
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function now properly handles the comparison of blocks by considering the type of the block and its location, and then comparing them to check for equality. This ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the values for the same columns in two `BlockManager` instances are of different types.
