The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing a failing test. The method compares two `BlockManager` instances and determines if they are equal by checking if they have the same axes and blocks. The failing test checks if two DataFrames are not equal but the `df1.equals(df2)` check returns `True` instead of `False`. This implies that the `equals` method is not correctly identifying the inequality between the two DataFrames.

Upon analyzing the run-time values and types of the input parameters and the expected values and types of variables, it is evident that the bug may be related to how the method is handling the comparison of the `blocks`. This comparison involves sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using a custom key function, which involves using the data type name and `mgr_locs`, but there seems to be an issue with this comparison algorithm.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method is being handled properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, repr(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison algorithm for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` has been modified to ensure a proper comparison of the blocks. The `canonicalize` function now uses the `dtypes` attribute of the block instead of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` represented as a string, ensuring that the blocks are compared correctly.

After applying these fixes, the failing test should pass, and the `equals` method should correctly identify the inequality between two DataFrames.
