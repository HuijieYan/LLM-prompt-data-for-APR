The buggy function is the method `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. This method is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class to determine if they are equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the comparison of attributes such as `axes`, `blocks`, and in the sorting and comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison of the `mgr_locs` attribute and the way blocks are being sorted and compared. There could be issues with the sorting algorithm and comparison logic for the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

To fix the bug, the comparison of `mgr_locs` and the sorting and comparison logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should be thoroughly reviewed and potentially revised.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_numpy().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `mgr_locs` attribute has been updated to use the `to_numpy` method to convert it to a NumPy array and then to a list. This ensures that the comparison of `mgr_locs` works as intended. Additionally, the sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `sorted` function has been updated to use the `canonicalize` function as the key for sorting. This should resolve any issues with the comparison of the blocks.
