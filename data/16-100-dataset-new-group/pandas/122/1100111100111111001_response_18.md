The bug in the equals function is causing the failing test because the ordering of the blocks is incorrect. The function is attempting to compare the blocks by sorting them using the canonicalize function, but the canonicalize function itself is using unconsolidated blocks, which leads to an incorrect result. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalize function properly handles unconsolidated blocks and provides a consistent ordering for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    # this ensures a consistent order for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        consolidated_block = block if block.is_consolidated() else block.consolidate()
        return (consolidated_block.dtype.name, consolidated_block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now properly consolidates unconsolidated blocks in the canonicalize function and provides a consistent ordering for comparison. This should resolve the failing test case.
