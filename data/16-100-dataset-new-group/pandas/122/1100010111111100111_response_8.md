## Revised function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order using a tuple combining the type name and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the canonicalize function to consider both the block values and the block's dtype, the bug is fixed. Now, the function should accurately compare the blocks between dataframes and return the correct result.

This bug was causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to wrongly return `True` in cases where identical blocks had different locations. Now, with this correction, the issue posted to GitHub should be resolved.
