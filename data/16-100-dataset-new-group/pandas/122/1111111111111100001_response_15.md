The problem occurs when comparing the two dataframes `df1` and `df2` in the failing test. It seems that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`, which causes the assertion error.

The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class seems to be incorrectly comparing the block managers of two dataframes. It is comparing the axes and blocks of the two dataframes to check for equality but there seems to be a logical error in the comparison.

From the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the variables right before the return of the buggy function, it can be observed that the axes and blocks of the two dataframes are being compared correctly. However, there is a discrepancy in the comparison logic causing the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class needs to be reviewed and modified to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks correctly returns `False` when the dataframes are not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
With this corrected version, the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class should now correctly compare the block managers of the two dataframes and return the expected result in the failing test case.
