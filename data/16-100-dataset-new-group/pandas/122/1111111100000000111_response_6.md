The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to incorrectly returning `True` in cases where identical blocks with different locations are being compared. This is evident from the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations", where a test case is failing and the expected output is `False`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of block equality
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks

The cause of the bug is likely related to the sorting and comparison of blocks, which may result in different orderings of identical blocks being considered unequal.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison of blocks to take into account the different block locations. We can update the comparison logic to consider both the type name and the block locations for sorting and comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.flags.id, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the block values flags id and the block locations to sort and compare the blocks. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be correctly identified as unequal.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the expected output.
