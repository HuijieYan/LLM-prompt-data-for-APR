The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return incorrect output in some cases, leading to failing test cases. The function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects and check if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` to check if they are equal.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a custom key.

The bug is causing the function to incorrectly return `True` in some cases, which is not the expected output according to the GitHub issue. The bug appears to be related to the comparison of block locations and the sorting based on a custom key.

To fix the bug, the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` should be revisited, ensuring that it correctly identifies if the axes are equal. Additionally, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the custom key should be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles unconsolidated blocks.

Now, let's provide a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the custom key for sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is modified to use the block itself as part of the tuple, along with `mgr_locs`. This should help in distinguishing unconsolidated blocks and ensure a proper comparison during sorting.
