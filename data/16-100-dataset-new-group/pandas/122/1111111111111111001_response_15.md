The bug in the `equals` function occurs because the comparison between different blocks is not being performed correctly. The blocks need to be sorted and then compared to ensure that their content and order match. Additionally, the placeholder for the `canonicalize` function is used twice in the same scope, leading to confusion. 

To fix the bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to be explicitly defined inside the `BlockManager` class. This resolves the conflict with the other implementation outside the class.
2. Sort the blocks for both `self` and `other` within the `equals` function before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class definitions and methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Sort the blocks before comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of the comparison of blocks, and the `canonicalize` function is specified within the `BlockManager` class. This should resolve the failing test case.
