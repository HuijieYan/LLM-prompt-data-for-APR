The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, but it is incorrectly defined in the class as well as outside of the class. Also, there is inconsistent use of `block` instead of `self_block` within the function which might cause confusion.

To fix the bug, I will start by removing the incorrectly defined `canonicalize` function from the class. Next, I will use `self_block` to refer to the blocks within the `equals` function instead of using `block` directly which will help to avoid any confusion.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(self_block):
        return (self_block.dtype.name, self_block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
