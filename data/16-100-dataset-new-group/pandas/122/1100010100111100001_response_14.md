The buggy function `equals` is intended to determine if two BlockManager objects are equal. However, the error message from the failing test shows that the function is not returning the expected result. The test fails with the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` returning `assert True is False`.

From the runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function, it can be seen that `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are tuples containing different blocks. However, within the function, both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted using a canonicalization function, and then compared for equality using `all`. This approach seems to have issues distinguishing between different blocks, hence causing the incorrect comparisons and failing the test.

To fix this bug, a strategy could involve changing the approach to compare the blocks within the BlockManager objects. Instead of attempting to sort and compare the blocks separately, the function can directly compare the block values within the BlockManager objects without the need for sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the direct comparison of blocks within the BlockManager objects, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and return the expected result.
