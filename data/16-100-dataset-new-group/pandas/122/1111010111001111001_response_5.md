To fix the buggy function, we need to focus on the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, which is used for comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables using the `canonicalize` function, and the comparison of each pair of blocks in the final return statement.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is incorrectly comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. It fails to properly handle the cases where the blocks are in different orders and have different values.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` method to first check the equality of the attributes `axes` and `blocks`. Then, we can sort the self and other blocks using the `canonicalize` function and compare them to check for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.axes != other.axes:
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```
In this corrected version, we first compare the `axes` of both `BlockManager` instances. If they are not equal, we return False. We then sort the `blocks` of both instances using the `canonicalize` function and compare them. If the sorted blocks are equal, we return True; otherwise, we return False.

This corrected version of the `equals` method should now pass the failing test.
