The bug in the equals function occurs when comparing two DataFrames where the blocks have identical data types but different locations. 

The issue arises when sorting the blocks using the canonicalize function, which incorrectly identifies blocks with the same data type but different locations as being equal. This results in the equals function returning True when it should return False.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to include the block's data type and its values to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function with the fix incorporated:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the data type and values to distinguish blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly distinguished and compared, resulting in the expected behavior for the equals function.

With this fix, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass.
