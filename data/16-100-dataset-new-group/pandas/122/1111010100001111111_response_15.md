To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block sorting and comparison are done correctly. Based on the GitHub issue, the DataFrame.equals() method is returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations, so there's a problem with how the blocks are being compared.

We can fix this issue by modifying the canonicalize function to include the block index when creating the tuple for comparison. This way, even if the blocks have identical content but different locations, they will be treated as different blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block, idx):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), idx)

    self_blocks = sorted([(block, idx) for idx, block in enumerate(self.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, idx) for idx, block in enumerate(other.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this correction, we are including the block index when creating the tuple for comparison in the canonicalize function. Then, when sorting the blocks, we are also including the index. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations will be treated as different blocks and will return the correct result.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the equals() method returns the expected output for cases of identical blocks with different locations.
