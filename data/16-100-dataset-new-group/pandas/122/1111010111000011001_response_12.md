The bug in the `equals` function is likely causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to produce incorrect results. The function is supposed to check if two BlockManager objects are equal. The bug could be related to how it handles the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists. 

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic in the `equals` function and identify where it is not correctly comparing the BlockManager objects.

Here is a fixed version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should address the issues with comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` produces the expected results.
