The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class seems to be incorrectly comparing the blocks of two objects and returning a wrong result. This is an issue because the `equals` method is expected to return True only if all elements are the same and in the same order. However, in the provided GitHub issue, it's reported that `df3.equals(df4)` is returning True when it should be False, indicating that the current implementation is not working as intended.

To fix the bug, we should review the way the `equals` function compares the blocks within the two objects. It's possible that the comparison logic is not correctly accounting for the different locations of identical blocks, causing the method to return an incorrect result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, we have modified the `canonicalize` function to use the `items` attribute of the blocks, as it seems to be necessary for creating a unique identifier for each block. This modification should fix the issue and ensure that the `equals` method behaves as expected.

By making this change, the function should now correctly compare the blocks of the two objects and return the expected result, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
