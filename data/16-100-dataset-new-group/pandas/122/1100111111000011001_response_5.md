The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is expected to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality, including their axes and blocks. However, the function fails a specific test case where it compares two different dataframes `df1` and `df2`, resulting in an assertion error `assert df1.equals(df2) is False`.

The bug occurs because the `equals` function is incorrectly implemented to work only with `BlockManager` instances, but the test function is expecting it to work for dataframes as well. 

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be updated to check if the `other` object is of type `BlockManager`, and if not, convert it to a dataframe before performing the comparison. Also, the sorting and canonicalization of blocks should only be performed for `BlockManager` instances, not dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        if isinstance(other, pd.DataFrame):
            other = pd.DataFrame(other)
        else:
            return False
        
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    if isinstance(self, BlockManager):
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    else:
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function first checks the type of the `other` object. If it is not a `BlockManager`, the function attempts to convert it to a dataframe. Then, the comparison logic is for the `BlockManager` instances while ignoring the sorting and canonicalization for dataframes. This fix ensures that the function can handle both `BlockManager` instances and dataframes for comparison.
