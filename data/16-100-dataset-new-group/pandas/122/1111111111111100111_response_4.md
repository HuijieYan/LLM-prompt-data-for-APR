The problem with the buggy function `equals` is that it can return `True` when comparing DataFrames that should be considered not equal due to differing block order. This occurs when the `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the blocks between the two DataFrames.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `equals` function to consider the order of the blocks when comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass. The corrected `equals` function accounts for the order of the blocks when comparing them, ensuring that the correct boolean output is returned. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post as well.
