### Bug Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not returning the correct result in some cases. Based on the error message and the provided test case, it seems that the function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be `False` for the provided DataFrames.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the `equals` function are:
1. Comparison of axes length.
2. Comparison of axes elements.
3. Sorting and comparison of blocks.
4. The conditional statements for returning `False`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the comparison and sorting of blocks within the `equals` function. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying differences between the DataFrames, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug-Fix Strategy
The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function correctly identifies differences between the DataFrames during comparison of axes and blocks. This involves checking the axes length and elements, as well as properly sorting and comparing the blocks to ensure accurate results.

### Corrected Version
Based on the analysis, the corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        (block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) and
         np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values))
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the potential error locations and aims to provide the correct output for the comparison between `self` and `other` DataFrames.
