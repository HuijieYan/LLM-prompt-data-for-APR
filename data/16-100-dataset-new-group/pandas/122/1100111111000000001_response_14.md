The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` because it is not handling the comparison of DataFrames with different data types correctly. The comparison logic is assuming that the blocks are in the same order which may not be the case when the DataFrames have different data types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of DataFrames takes into account the different data types and their order.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we compare the number of blocks first, and then iterate through each block to check for equality. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the order and data type of the blocks within the DataFrames.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
