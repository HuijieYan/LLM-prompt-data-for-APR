The bug in the `equals` function is that it is not properly handling the comparison of blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect returns. The issue has been reported on GitHub as `BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations`. The expected behavior is for the function to return `False` when comparing dataframes `df3` and `df4` due to their different block locations.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be updated to properly handle block comparisons and return the correct result. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block._values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function will properly handle the sorting and comparison of blocks, ensuring the correct result is returned.

With this correction, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, and the `BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations` GitHub issue should be resolved.
