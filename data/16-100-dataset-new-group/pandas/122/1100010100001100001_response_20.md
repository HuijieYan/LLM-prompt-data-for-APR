The buggy function is a method of a class and compares two objects of the same class. It checks if the axes of two objects are equal, then compares the blocks of the objects based on the dtype name and mgr_locs.

The potential error location in the code is the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method, as well as the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function does not take into account the actual content of the blocks and only considers the dtype name and mgr_locs, which may not be sufficient for determining equality.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to take into account the actual content of the blocks, as well as modify the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    if not all(
        compare_blocks(block1, block2)
        for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    ):
        return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we have modified the comparison of the blocks to use the `equals` method directly and removed the `canonicalize` function, which was potentially causing the bug. We are comparing the actual content of the blocks to determine their equality.
