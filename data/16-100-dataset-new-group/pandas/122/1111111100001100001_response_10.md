The bug in the equals function is likely occurring due to issues with comparing the blocks within the BlockManager.

In the buggy function, the function canonicalize is redefined within the equals function, which is unnecessary. Also, a variable `block` is referenced within the canonicalize function without being passed as a parameter. This is incorrect and might lead to the bug.

Another issue is with the comparison of blocks within the self and other BlockManagers. The comparison is not considering the content of the blocks, and is instead sorting the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be removed from the equals function, and the comparison of blocks should consider the actual content of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, the canonicalize function is removed and the comparison of blocks is changed to directly compare the blocks using the equals function. This will ensure that the content of the blocks is being compared correctly.
