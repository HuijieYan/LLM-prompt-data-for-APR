The buggy function "equals" is intended to compare two BlockManager objects and return True if they are equal, and False otherwise. However, the test function "test_dataframe_not_equal" is showing that the function is returning True for cases where it should be returning False, indicating a bug in the function.

The issue reported on GitHub further confirms that the DataFrame.equals() method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The canonicalize block order
2. The sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks

The cause of the bug:
The bug is likely in the canonicalize function and the subsequent sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks. The canonicalize function returns a tuple combining the dtype name and mgr_locs, which may not correctly handle unconsolidated blocks.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalize function correctly handles unconsolidated blocks, and the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks is done effectively to compare the blocks from two BlockManager objects accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate inplace before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version addresses the issue by consolidating the blocks before comparison and using a revised canonicalize function to correctly sort and compare the blocks.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the equals function returns the expected output for the failing test case.
