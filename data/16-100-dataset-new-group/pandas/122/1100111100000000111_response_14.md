The bug in the buggy function `equals()` is causing it to return True when it should return False in case of identical blocks with different locations. The issue is related to the comparison of DataFrames `df3.equals(df4)`, where `df3` and `df4` have the same data but in a different order.

The cause of the bug is in the `equals` function, where it uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks in different DataFrames based on their dtype and locations. However, the sorting based on location is causing the bug to return True even when the data in the blocks is the same but located differently.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to only use dtype for sorting and remove any sorting based on locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
By removing the sorting based on location in the `canonicalize` function, the bug should now be fixed and the `equals()` function should return the expected result.
