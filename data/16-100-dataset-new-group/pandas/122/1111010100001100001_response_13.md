The buggy function `equals` is comparing the attributes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal. It uses the `.equals` method on the axes and blocks, and then sorts and compares the blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic of the blocks.

The bug occurs because the code is not correctly comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. It is assuming that the order of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` should be the same, but this is not necessarily true. The comparison logic also does not account for the possibility of unconsolidated blocks.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to properly handle unconsolidated blocks and avoid assuming a specific order of the blocks. We can achieve this by creating a function that groups the blocks based on a key and then compares the groupings rather than attempting to sort and compare each block directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # group and compare blocks
    def get_block_key(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_block_groups = {get_block_key(block): block for block in self.blocks}
    other_block_groups = {get_block_key(block): block for block in other.blocks}

    if len(self_block_groups) != len(other_block_groups):
        return False

    return all(self_block_groups.get(key).equals(other_block_groups.get(key)) for key in self_block_groups)
```

In this corrected version, the blocks are grouped based on the keys generated by the `get_block_key` function, and then these groupings are compared to ensure that unconsolidated blocks are handled properly and the comparison is not relying on the order of the blocks. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function works as intended.
