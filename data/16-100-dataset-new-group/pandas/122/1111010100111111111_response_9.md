The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is causing the test to fail. The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is the expected result. Analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the expected values and types of relevant variables provides insight into the cause of the bug and the strategy for fixing it.

### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` fails to compare the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` correctly, leading to the incorrect result. The cause of this bug is that the comparison of blocks is not taking into account the block's locations. As a result, blocks with identical data but different locations are considered equal, leading to the incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function needs to be modified to consider both the block's type and its locations. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modify the block comparison to consider both type and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function will correctly compare blocks based on both their type and locations, resolving the bug and ensuring that the failing test passes as expected.
