Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug arises from the comparison of blocks with different locations. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not handling the comparison of blocks with different locations correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to include the block's index along with the block type and locations. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account the block's location and prevents the incorrect return of `True` when comparing blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type,
    # name, and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block_index)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the `block_index` in the `canonicalize` function, the comparison now takes into account the block's location, which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This change ensures that the `equals` function correctly handles comparisons of blocks with different locations and returns the expected results.
