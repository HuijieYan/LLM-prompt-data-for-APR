The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames that should be considered unequal.

The bug is likely occurring in the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function, but it seems that there is an issue with the sorting or comparison process that is causing incorrect results.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is attempting to check if two DataFrames are equal or not by using the `equals` method, which should return `False` in this case. However, the function is returning `True` instead.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function is being done correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs._start, block.mgr_locs._stop, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this version, I modified the `canonicalize` function to use the start and stop values of `mgr_locs` in addition to the dtype name for sorting the blocks. This should ensure that the canonicalization produces a more accurate order for comparison.

After making these changes, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
