The buggy function `equals(self, other)` incorrectly returns True in some cases when the blocks have identical content but different locations. The issue has been reported on GitHub and is described as the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the `canonicalize` function, where the order of the blocks is being compared without considering the location. This causes the function to return True even when the content of the blocks is identical but their locations are different.

To fix the bug, I would suggest modifying the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the block locations so that it takes into account the content as well as the locations of the blocks during comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and block values to differentiate identical blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block values along with the type name and mgr_locs. This ensures that the comparison considers the content as well as the locations of the blocks, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
