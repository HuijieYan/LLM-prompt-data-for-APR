Based on the provided code and the nature of the bug, it seems that the main issue lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is tasked with checking if two `BlockManager` objects are equal, but it contains some logic that is not functioning as intended.

The bug can be attributed to the following factors:
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` lists is not sufficient to determine equality between the two `BlockManager` objects.
2. There is a missing `self._consolidate_inplace()` call before comparing the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
3. The `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function doesn't seem to be properly defined or utilized.

To fix the bug, a more comprehensive approach is needed to compare the two `BlockManager` objects. This can be achieved by considering not only the lengths of the axes and blocks but also comparing the contents of the axes and the individual blocks themselves.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for i, ax1 in enumerate(self_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function now iterates through the axes and blocks to ensure that the contents are equal. It also includes calls to `_consolidate_inplace()` appropriately and does not rely on the faulty `canonicalize` function. This should provide a more accurate comparison between the two `BlockManager` objects.
