The buggy function `equals()` in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` has an issue that causes it to incorrectly return `True` in cases where it should be returning `False`. This bug has been reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The bug is causing the `equals()` method to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks, but different locations. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` provided in the test file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` also demonstrates this issue by comparing two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) that have different data types for the columns, but the `equals()` method incorrectly returns `True`.

The root cause of this bug lies in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort blocks of the DataFrames before comparison. This can cause unconsolidated blocks (like Categorical) to be incorrectly considered equal due to the order in which they are sorted.

To fix this bug, a possible strategy is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional information that distinguishes blocks based on their data types and locations. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block's data type and location in the tuple returned, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal. This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` pass.
