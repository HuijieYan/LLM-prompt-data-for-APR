The buggy function `equals` is used to compare the equality of two DataFrames. The GitHub issue describes a scenario where `df3.equals(df4)` wrongly returns `True` even though the two DataFrames have different values. This issue happens when identical blocks of data are in different locations.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `canonicalize` function does not consider the different locations of identical blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.
2. The condition for checking the length of self.blocks and other.blocks is not adequate for determining equality.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not properly account for blocks with identical values but in different positions. As a result, the function incorrectly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to account for the different locations of identical blocks. Additionally, the function should compare the blocks based on the actual values and their positions within the DataFrames.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include the block values along with its position for canonicalization
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `canonicalize` function now includes the block values along with its position for canonicalization. This ensures that identical blocks with different positions are not considered equal.
2. The comparison of blocks now includes checking for the equality of values as well as their positions within the DataFrames.

This corrected version of the `equals` function addresses the issue reported on GitHub by properly accounting for identical blocks with different locations and returning the expected result.
