The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is responsible for checking if two `BlockManager` objects are equal based on their axes and blocks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the class and once inside the class, and only the one inside the class should be used.
2. The function is directly comparing the memory addresses of the blocks instead of their contents.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not comparing the contents of the blocks correctly. The blocks are being sorted and the `equals` method is used to compare them, but the `equals` method itself might be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks' contents correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use the `values` attribute of the blocks to compare their contents instead of directly comparing the blocks themselves. This ensures that we are comparing the actual data within the blocks.

Additionally, I removed the redundant `canonicalize` function defined outside the class since the one inside the class is the one being used. I also fixed a small mistake by calling `as_array()` and `tolist()` methods on the `mgr_locs` and `block` objects, respectively.
