The bug in the equals function is that it is not comparing the actual block data for equality. It is only comparing the block and external location of each block and then returning True. The function is missing a comparison of block data.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the equals function to compare the actual block data as well.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Compare block data as well
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block data along with block and external location for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the function, it now compares both the block and external location along with the block data for equality. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
