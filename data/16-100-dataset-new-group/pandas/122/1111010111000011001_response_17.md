The buggy function `equals` is failing because it is not handling the comparison of dataframes with different datatypes correctly. The function is sorting the blocks based on the datatype name and then comparing them, causing it to fail when the datatypes are different.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to compare the dataframes directly, rather than sorting and comparing the blocks by datatype name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function now directly compares the blocks of the dataframes without sorting by datatype name, which should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
