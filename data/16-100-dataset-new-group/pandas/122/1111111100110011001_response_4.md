To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue with the comparison of DataFrames `df1` and `df2` failing. The error message `assert True is False` indicates that the comparison is resulting in `True`, even though it should be `False`.

The expected behavior of the `equals` function is to compare two BlockManager objects and return `False` if they are not equal based on their axes and blocks.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the comparison is happening within the function. It's possible that the comparison logic is not correctly identifying differences between the block structures of the two DataFrames.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic within the `equals` function to ensure that it properly compares the axes and blocks of the BlockManager objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if not all(self_axis.equals(other_axis) for self_axis, other_axis in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(other_block) for block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, we compare the axes of the BlockManager objects one by one using the `.equals` method. Then, we consolidate both BlockManagers in place and compare their blocks. The `canonicalize` function ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their type name and locations, allowing for accurate comparison.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
