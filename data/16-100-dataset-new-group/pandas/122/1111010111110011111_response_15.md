## Analysis
The `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. However, the bug causes it to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two different instances. The error message confirms an assertion failure indicating that `assert True is False`, which is unexpected. The `GitHub` issue further confirms that the function is expected to return `False` but instead returns `True` in certain scenarios.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Comparison logic within the `equals` function.
2. The sorting logic using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function is not comprehensive enough to handle the heterogeneous data types in separate locations correctly. This results in the incorrect comparison.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks when the data has different types in separate locations. To fix the bug, the comparison logic and the sorting method should be updated to handle such heterogeneous data types correctly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    # because there might be unconsolidated blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished
    # by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, repr(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version includes changes to the `canonicalize` function to use a combination of `dtype.name` and the representation of `mgr_locs` to handle heterogeneous data types correctly. This should resolve the comparison issues when consolidating the blocks and result in the correct comparison of two `BlockManager` instances.
