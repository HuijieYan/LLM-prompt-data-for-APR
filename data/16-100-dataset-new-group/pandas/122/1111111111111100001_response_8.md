The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` to check if they are equal. However, the comparison fails and raises an AssertionError.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison logic leading to the failure of the assertion.
2. Issues with the implementation of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic inside the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is incorrect. It is failing to correctly compare the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on their contents and is not accounting for the specific index orders in the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the `equals` method to handle the comparison of the DataFrames correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on the index
    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.min())
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.min())

    # Compare each block in the sorted list
    for block1, block2 in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

By sorting the blocks based on their index values and then comparing each block, we ensure that the comparison is based on the contents of the DataFrames and their index order.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass without raising any assertions.
