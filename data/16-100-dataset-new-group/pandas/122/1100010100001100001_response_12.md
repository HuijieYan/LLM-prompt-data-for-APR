The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. The comparison is being based solely on the order of the blocks, rather than their actual content.

The function first checks if the number of axes of `self` and `other` is the same, and if all the individual axes are equal. After this, it checks if the number of blocks in `self` and `other` is the same. Then, it attempts to compare the blocks themselves.

However, the comparison of the blocks is flawed because it sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function that only considers the block's data type, and the block's manager locations. This sorting may not accurately identify differences in the actual content of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks should be based on their actual content, rather than their order or characteristics.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare the blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, the comparison of the blocks is done by iterating through each block and comparing them individually using the `.equals()` method, which compares their actual content.

By making this change, the function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other` based on the actual content of their blocks, fixing the bug.
