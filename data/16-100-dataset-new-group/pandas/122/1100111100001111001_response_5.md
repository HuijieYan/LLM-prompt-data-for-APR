The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison of two BlockManager objects. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two BlockManagers and checks for equality. However, there are inconsistencies in the canonicalization and sorting of the blocks that may lead to incorrect comparison results.

The bug could be caused by the sorting and canonicalization function that is used to compare the blocks. It is possible that the canonicalization function is not correctly implemented or does not account for all relevant properties of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalization function accurately captures the essential properties of the blocks. Additionally, the sorting of the blocks based on canonicalization should be consistent and reflect the intended order for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the canonicalization function `canonicalize` is defined to capture the type name and location of the blocks, and the blocks are sorted based on the canonicalized values. This ensures that the comparison is consistent and accurate.
