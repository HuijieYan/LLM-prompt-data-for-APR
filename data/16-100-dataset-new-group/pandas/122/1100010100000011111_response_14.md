The bug in the `equals` function is that it returns `True` incorrectly in the case of identical blocks with different locations. The issue is that the function does not properly compare the blocks and their locations, leading to an incorrect result. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's locations, which will differentiate between identical blocks with different locations. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple of the type name, dtype, and block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, dtype
    # and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks which can
    # only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function takes into account the dtype and block locations in addition to the type name when canonicalizing the blocks for comparison. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly distinguished, and the function will return the correct result.
