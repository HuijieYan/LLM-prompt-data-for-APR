The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test. The bug is in the sorting logic in the function, which is impacting the equality check of two DataFrames.

The bug appears to be in the `canonicalize` function's `mgr_locs` attribute. The `mgr_locs` attribute is not being correctly sorted and causing the `equals` function to provide false results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to accurately return the expected order for blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        tuple_list = []
        for loc in block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist():
            tuple_list.append(tuple(loc))
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple_list)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
By modifying the `canonicalize` function to take into account the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly, it should fix the bug and enable the `equals` function to pass the failing test.
