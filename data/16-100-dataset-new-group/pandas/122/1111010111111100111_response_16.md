The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison between the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The function fails to correctly compare blocks with the same content but different locations.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations when comparing the two `BlockManager` instances.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances, accounting for the possibility of blocks with the same content but different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Import the necessary module
from pandas._libs import lib

# Updated version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [blk.values for blk in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [blk.values for blk in other.blocks]

    result, _, _, _ = lib.blockwise_equals(
        self_blocks,
        other_blocks,
        self.axes[0],
        self.items,
        [0, 1] if len(self_blocks) > 1 else [0],
        None,
    )

    return result
```

This corrected version includes using the `lib.blockwise_equals` method to compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances, accounting for the possibility of blocks with the same content but different locations.

With this fix, the `equals` function should correctly compare `BlockManager` instances and address the issue reported on GitHub.
