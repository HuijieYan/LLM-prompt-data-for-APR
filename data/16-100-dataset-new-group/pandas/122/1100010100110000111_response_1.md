The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method for DataFrames in Pandas is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is causing the failing test and has been reported as an issue on GitHub.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the `canonicalize` function for sorting the blocks and the comparison of sorted blocks using the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's shape in addition to its dtype name and mgr_locs. This will differentiate between blocks with identical type and location but different shapes. Furthermore, we need to update the comparison of sorted blocks using the `equals` method to check for shape equality before comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, shape, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # compare sorted blocks, checking for shape equality first
    if any(block.shape != oblock.shape for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and make the failing test pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
