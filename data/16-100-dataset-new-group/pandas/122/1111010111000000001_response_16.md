The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in pandas/core/internals/managers.py. The function is designed to check if two BlockManager instances are equal. The function has several potential error locations including the comparison of axes, consolidation of blocks, and canonicalization of block order.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect comparison of the two dataframes `df1` and `df2` in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` defined in pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py. The bug arises because the `equals` method does not handle dataframes with different column data types correctly, leading to a false positive in the comparison.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the `equals` method to properly handle dataframes with different column data types and ensure that the comparison takes into account the entire structure and contents of the dataframes.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks()
    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other_blocks) for block in self_blocks
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will properly handle dataframes with different column data types and ensure the comparison of the entire structure and contents. The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
