The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return `True` instead of the expected `False`. 

The issue arises from the comparison of two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The test assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, resulting in the error message: `E       assert True is False`. This error occurs because the buggy `equals` function does not correctly compare the two DataFrames, leading to a True assertion instead of the expected False.

In the `equals` function, the bug arises when comparing the blocks within each DataFrame. The comparison is meant to return False if there are any differences between the two DataFrames. However, due to the buggy logic, the function is incorrectly returning True in some scenarios, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be corrected to accurately compare the blocks of the two DataFrames and return the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should now pass as expected.

This fix addresses the bug by properly comparing the blocks within the DataFrames and returning the correct result.
