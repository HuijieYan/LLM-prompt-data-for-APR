The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library. The function is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal, however, the function contains a bug that causes it to fail under certain circumstances.

The error message from the failing test shows that it is asserting `True` is equal to `False`, indicating that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, we can see that the `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. However, the actual comparison of the blocks is done using the `equals` method, which may not consider this sorting order. This could lead to misinterpretation of the block equality.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should not only sort the blocks but also make sure that the contents of the blocks are sorted in a consistent manner so that they can be directly compared.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, sorted(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the updated version, within the `canonicalize` function, the manager locations of the block are sorted to ensure a consistent comparison. This should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result, passing the failing test.
