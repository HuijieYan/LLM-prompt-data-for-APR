The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that it incorrectly compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. This comparison is problematic because it does not properly handle cases where the blocks are unconsolidated, such as when dealing with Categorical data.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. We can do this by sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block. This will ensure that unconsolidated blocks are properly handled during the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these modifications, the `equals` function should now properly compare the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances, effectively fixing the bug.
