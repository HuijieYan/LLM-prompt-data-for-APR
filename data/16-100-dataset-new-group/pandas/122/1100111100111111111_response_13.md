In the given buggy function, the issue seems to be related to the incorrect comparison of DataFrames using the `equals` method. The buggy function does not handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations correctly, hence returning True instead of False.

The cause of the bug can be identified by the failing test, where it is expected that `df1.equals(df2)` should return False, but the actual output is True.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's `mgr_locs` for creating a unique representation of each block. This would ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly distinguished during comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare identical blocks with different locations and return the expected result. This should resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug in the `equals` method of the DataFrame class.
