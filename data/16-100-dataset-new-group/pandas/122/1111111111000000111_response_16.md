The buggy function `equals` is wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This bug is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not correctly compare DataFrame objects and returns True even when the data within the DataFrame objects are not equal, as seen in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare the actual data within the DataFrame objects, rather than just comparing the block locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the actual data within the blocks
    for b in self.blocks:
        if b not in other.blocks:
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function will correctly compare the data within the DataFrame objects and return True only if the data is identical.

This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
