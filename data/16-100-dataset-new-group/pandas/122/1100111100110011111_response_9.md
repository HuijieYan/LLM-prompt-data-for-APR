The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to wrongly return `True` in cases where the blocks have identical content but are located differently. This is contrary to the expected behavior of returning `False` in such cases as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Identification
The bug occurs in the `equals` function, where the program fails to compare identical blocks with different locations and instead returns `True` when it should return `False`.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly check for the equality of the blocks due to their different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should properly compare the blocks while taking into account the differences in location for identical blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
    )
```

By incorporating the location of the blocks into the comparison process, the corrected version of the `equals` function is now able to properly compare identical blocks with different locations and return the expected `False` value.

With the corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values as well as resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
