The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test due to the following reasons:

1. The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are being sorted using a custom key defined by the `canonicalize` function. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` is not used in the `canonicalize` function, causing incorrect sorting of the blocks.

2. The failing test is comparing two DataFrames that have different column types, which should return `False`. However, the bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and dtype, to distinguish blocks properly
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` and `dtype` attributes of the `block`, the function will properly compare and sort the blocks, leading to the correct comparison between two DataFrames with different column types.
