## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is happening because the function is not sorting the blocks before comparison, leading to a false positive result.

The failing test is attempting to compare two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, using the `equals` method. It expects the result to be `False` but is getting `True`. The issue arises from the way the function handles the comparison of blocks belonging to the DataFrames.

In the provided runtime values, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted using `canonicalize` function which considers the type name and `mgr_locs`. However, the `canonicalize` function is considering the type name but is not correctly considering `mgr_locs` for comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be updated to consider both the type name and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, the function should sort the blocks before comparing them. This can be achieved by creating a tuple that combines the type name and `mgr_locs`, ensuring that blocks with identical data and different positions are correctly identified.

## Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted before being compared, ensuring that blocks with identical data but different positions will not falsely pass the comparison.
