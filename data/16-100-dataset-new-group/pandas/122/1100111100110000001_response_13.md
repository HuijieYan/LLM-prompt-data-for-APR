The buggy function `equals` is checking whether two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and content. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, with the actual result being `assert True is False`, meaning the two DataFrames are erroneously considered equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of the content of DataFrame `df1` with DataFrame `df2`.
2. The `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function is not defined correctly, which affects the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
3. The `_consolidate_inplace` method is called on `self` and `other` without being used correctly.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison process, the sorting of the blocks, and the use of the `_consolidate_inplace` method, resulting in DataFrames that are not equal being erroneously considered equal.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to properly compare the blocks and make sure that `_consolidate_inplace` is used as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the dataframes inplace before further comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block.dtype, CategoricalDtype):
            return (block.values, block.index)
        return (block.values, block.index)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the dataframes are consolidated before further comparison. We also modify the `canonicalize` function to properly compare the blocks by considering the block values and index, especially when dealing with categorical data types. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function behave as intended.
