## Correction:

The bug is likely due to the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. It is apparent that the comparison of blocks does not account for the possibility of identical blocks located at different positions. This leads to the unexpected `True` output in the failing case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to account for their locations. One way to do this is to consider the locations of the blocks in the comparison. We can use the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block to compare locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = {canonicalize(block): block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {canonicalize(block): block for block in other.blocks}
    if set(self_blocks.keys()) != set(other_blocks.keys()):
        return False

    return all(
        self_blocks[key].equals(other_blocks[key]) for key in self_blocks
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We define a `canonicalize` function that returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`.
- We create dictionaries `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, where the keys are the canonicalized blocks and the values are the original blocks.
- We compare the keys of the dictionaries to ensure they have the same set of blocks.
- We then compare the blocks using their locations and attributes to determine equality.

This correction accounts for the possibility of identical blocks located at different positions and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
