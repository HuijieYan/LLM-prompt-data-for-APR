To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` takes into account the internal location of each block. This will ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations will be correctly identified as unequal.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The most significant change is in the `canonicalize` function, where the location of each block is included in the tuple that is used for sorting. This ensures that blocks with the same data but different locations will be correctly identified as unequal.

With this corrected version, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass and return the expected value of `False` as specified.
