The problem lies in the `canonicalize` function. The buggy code defines a `canonicalize` function twice, once outside the class and once inside the class `BlockManager`. This can lead to confusion and may not guarantee the expected behavior. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function inside the class `BlockManager` is not being called correctly.

To fix the bug, we can remove the redundant definition of the `canonicalize` function inside the class `BlockManager` and ensure that the correct `canonicalize` function is being called.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring that the correct `canonicalize` function is called and removing the redundant definition inside the class, this corrected version of the function should pass the failing test provided.
