The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks in the `self` and `other` instances. The function compares the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function and then checks if all blocks are equal with the `equals` method. However, there seems to be an issue with the comparison of the block's `mgr_locs` attribute.

The 'canonicalize' function is used to sort the blocks, and it relies on the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks. However, in the provided runtime values, the `block.mgr_locs` seems to have a value of `BlockPlacement(slice(0, 1, 1))`, which does not support the `as_array.tolist()` method that the `canonicalize` function tries to use.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified or enhanced to handle the `block.mgr_locs` attribute appropriately. Additionally, it might be necessary to validate the `mgr_locs` attribute and ensure that it provides a valid comparison when sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this fixed version, I modified the `canonicalize` function to convert the block type to a string and used the `mgr_locs` attribute directly without converting it to an array, which should address the issue with the comparison and sorting of the blocks.
