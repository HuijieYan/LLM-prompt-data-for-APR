The bug in the function `equals` occurs when comparing two DataFrames in the `pandas` library. The issue arises from the way the function compares identical blocks with different locations.

The `equals` function starts by comparing the axes of the two BlockManagers, ensuring they have the same length and that all corresponding axes are equal. Then, it consolidates both BlockManagers and compares the lengths of their blocks. Finally, it tries to canonicalize the block order and compares the blocks element-wise.

The bug in the function occurs in the final comparison step where it tries to canonicalize the block order. The issue arises from the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks based on their data type and locations. The comparison of blocks is faulty, as it doesn't handle cases where identical blocks might have different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to handle cases where identical blocks with different locations are compared.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then block values to handle identical blocks with different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now compares the block values as tuples, handling cases where identical blocks have different locations.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
