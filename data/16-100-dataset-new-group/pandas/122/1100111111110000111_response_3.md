The bug in the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file causes the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail. This bug was reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The root cause of this bug is that the `equals` function does not correctly compare two DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2`. It's failing to return the correct result when the two DataFrames have different block locations but the same content.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks in a way that takes into account the possibility of different block locations resulting in different iteration orders. We can address this by sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `df1.equals(df2)` test should now pass, and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
