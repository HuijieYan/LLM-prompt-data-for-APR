Looking at the buggy function `equals` in the class `BlockManager`, the issue seems to be related to the sorting mechanism that should be applied to `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The current implementation doesn't handle the sorting correctly, which leads to the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The expected behavior for this function is to compare two BlockManager instances, `self` and `other`, by comparing their `axes` and `blocks` attributes. The `blocks` should be sorted based on their dtype and manager locations, and then each block should be compared for equality.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on dtype and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, and all the provided runtime and expected variables and types should be correctly handled.
