The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return True in case of identical blocks with different locations, instead of returning False as expected.

The potential error is in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function, where the blocks are being sorted based on a tuple combining the type name and then `mgr_locs`. However, the `mgr_locs` is being accessed incorrectly with `.as_array.tolist()`, which may lead to incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is not correctly handling the comparison of blocks based on their type and locations.

To fix the bug, the `mgr_locs` should be accessed directly without conversion to a list, and the comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function needs to be adjusted for correct sorting of blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, the `mgr_locs` is accessed directly as a tuple, the type name is retrieved using `type(block).__name__`, and the blocks are sorted and compared based on these values. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function return the correct output as expected.
