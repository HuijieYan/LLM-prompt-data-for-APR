The bug in the equals() function causes it to incorrectly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly compare the blocks. When comparing the blocks, the function sorts the blocks and then uses the equals() method to compare them. However, the sorting is not based on the correct criteria, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to update the canonicalize function to properly sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly identified as unequal.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function properly sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations before comparing them, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.

This corrected version of the equals() function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
