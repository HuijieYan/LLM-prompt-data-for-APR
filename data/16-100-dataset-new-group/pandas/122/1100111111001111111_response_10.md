The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with different locations. When sorting the blocks, the order is based on the block's data type and locations, which might not reflect the actual equality of the blocks in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to re-implement the comparison of blocks in a way that correctly determines their equality, regardless of their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.index))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.index))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, instead of sorting the blocks based on the data type and locations, we are sorting them based on the block's values and index. This should provide a more accurate comparison of the blocks, addressing the issue of wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

By implementing this change, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and correctly determine the equality of the blocks.
