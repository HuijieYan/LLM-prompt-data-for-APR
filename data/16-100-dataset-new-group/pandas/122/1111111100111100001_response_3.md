The bug seems to be caused by a sorting issue when comparing the blocks. 

The canonicalize function is called twice, once inside the buggy function and once outside in the class definition. However, the canonicalize function inside the buggy function is missing the 'self' parameter which causes it to fail when called from within the class.

To fix the bug, we need to pass 'self' as a parameter to the canonicalize function inside the buggy function.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(self, x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(self, x))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By passing 'self' as a parameter to the canonicalize function inside the buggy function, we ensure it has access to the necessary attributes of the class instance. This should resolve the sorting issue and fix the bug.
