The bug in the `equals` function is that it doesn't handle the comparison of the data blocks in the `BlockManager` class correctly. The function attempts to sort the blocks by their data type and positions, but this approach does not guarantee that the blocks in `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects are truly equivalent.

To fix the bug, we can use a simpler approach to compare the data blocks. We can compare the number of data blocks first, and then iterate through each block in `self` and compare it to the corresponding block in `other`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Compare the blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly compare the `BlockManager` objects and return the correct result for the failing test case.
