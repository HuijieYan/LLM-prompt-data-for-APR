The buggy function `equals` in the class `BlockManager` appears to be comparing two block managers for equality. This function is being used to compare two DataFrame objects in the failing test.

Upon analyzing the buggy function and runtime input/output values, the potential error location is the sorting and comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists.

The `canonicalize` function is meant to create a key for sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. However, there is a discrepancy in the input and output types, which could be causing the failing test.

The potential cause of the bug is that the key created by the `canonicalize` function may not be consistent with the actual comparison of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to return a consistent key for sorting and comparison of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function returns a consistent key for sorting based on the dtype name and `mgr_locs.values`. Additionally, the dtype is converted to a string to avoid any comparison discrepancies. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
