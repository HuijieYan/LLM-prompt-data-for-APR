The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison and sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The bug is causing the failing test because the sorting of the blocks is incorrect, leading to a comparison that does not accurately reflect the equality of the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, we need to redefine the `canonicalize` function such that it correctly distinguishes and orders the blocks by their data type and location within the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define canonicalize function to order blocks by dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function orders blocks based on their data type, location (`mgr_locs`), and values. This ensures that the blocks are properly distinguished and sorted, leading to an accurate comparison between the DataFrames.
