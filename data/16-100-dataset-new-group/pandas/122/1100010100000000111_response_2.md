The buggy function `equals` is located in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The GitHub issue highlights a problem with the `equals` function where it wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

After analyzing the function, the potential error locations are in the block sorting and comparison process. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, and then the `equals` function is used to compare the sorted blocks.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the sorting of the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. This sorting may not accurately represent the equality of the blocks, leading to the function returning incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the sorting mechanism needs to be improved to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalization and sorting process has been removed, and the comparison now directly operates on the original blocks. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
