To fix the buggy function, we need to address the issue with the comparison of the block elements in the `equals` function. One way to fix this is to sort the elements of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on their dtype and mgr_locs. Then, we can compare the elements one by one.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and mgr_locs for each block. We then compare the sorted blocks for equality. This should address the issue of unconsolidated blocks affecting the comparison result and provide the expected output.
