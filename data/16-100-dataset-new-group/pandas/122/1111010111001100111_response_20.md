The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is incorrectly comparing the blocks of two BlockManager objects. It is not considering the possibility of identical blocks with different locations, resulting in a false comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the location information of the blocks when sorting them. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not falsely identified as different.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks of two BlockManager objects, taking into account the location information, and pass the failing test case identified in the GitHub issue.
