The bug in the equals function is causing the failing test to return `True is False`, which raises an AssertionError. The bug is likely related to the sorting and comparison of the blocks in the BlockManager objects.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for comparing the blocks in the BlockManager objects within the equals function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort the blocks based on column names for comparison
    self_blocks = dict((blk.mgr_locs, blk) for blk in self.blocks)
    other_blocks = dict((blk.mgr_locs, blk) for blk in other.blocks)
    return all(
        self_blocks[loc].equals(other_blocks[loc]) for loc in self_blocks
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on their manager locations and then compares the blocks for equality.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to DataFrame.equals() wrongly returning True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.
