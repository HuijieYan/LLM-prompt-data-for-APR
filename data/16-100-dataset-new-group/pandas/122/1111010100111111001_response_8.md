The bug in the `equals` function arises from incorrect comparison of block order. The function fails to account for the possibility of unconsolidated blocks which can only be distinguished by the iteration order. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to account for unconsolidated blocks. We can create a key that combines the type name and locations of the blocks to ensure proper ordering.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will now properly compare the block order and distinguish unconsolidated blocks by their type name and manager locations. This should resolve the failing test case.
