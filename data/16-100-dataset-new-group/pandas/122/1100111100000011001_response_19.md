The bug in the function appears to be related to the handling of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. It involves sorting and comparing these blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs attributes.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is defined twice in the class BlockManager. The first definition of `canonicalize` is at the module level and the second is within the class. When the function is called, the second definition of `canonicalize` within the class is used instead of the one at the module level, which is likely unintended.

To fix the bug, we should remove the redundant definition of `canonicalize` within the class and ensure that the correct `canonicalize` function is used.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # other methods of the class...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # define the canonicalize function at the module level
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly compare the block attributes and return the expected results for the given test cases.
