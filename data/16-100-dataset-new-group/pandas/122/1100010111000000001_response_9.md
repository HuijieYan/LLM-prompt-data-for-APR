## Analysis:
The buggy function is `equals` in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. This function is used to check for equality between two objects.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function.
2. Sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function which is used to sort the blocks. It does not handle the case where the data frames have different types for the same column names.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the case where the data frames have different types for the same column names.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modify canonicalize function to handle different types for the same column names
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This corrected version modifies the `canonicalize` function to consider the `dtypes` of the blocks in addition to the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to handle cases where the data frames have different types for the same column names.
