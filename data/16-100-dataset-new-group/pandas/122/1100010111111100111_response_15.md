## Error Fixing Strategy
The failing test case is comparing two DataFrames with the `equals` method, and it expects the comparison to return `False` because the order of the columns is different in the two DataFrames. However, the buggy `equals` method does not account for the order of the columns when comparing the DataFrames, leading to the incorrect assertion failure.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to consider the order of the columns in the DataFrames when performing the comparison.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Consider the order of the blocks when comparing
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    ) and self._data.equals(other._data)
```

By modifying the `equals` method to consider the order of the blocks as well as the order of the columns in the underlying data, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
