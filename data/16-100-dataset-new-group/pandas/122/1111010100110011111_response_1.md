The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module. The function is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances and determine if they are equal. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` comparison returns `True` instead of `False`.

Upon analyzing the function, it is apparent that the bug may exist in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` due to the sorting of these blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug can be traced to the failure of the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, leading to an incorrect determination of equality. This results in the `df1.equals(df2)` comparison returning `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, it's essential to ensure that the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances are correctly compared to determine their equality.

A corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This revised version of the `equals` function correctly compares the axes and blocks of the `BlockManager` instances to determine equality, ensuring that the comparison returns the expected result.
