The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to wrongly return `True` in some cases where it should return `False`. The issue arises when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

The error lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function. To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison logic to properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a combination of the type name and mgr_locs
    # to properly handle blocks with different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we update the `canonicalize` function to consider not just the block data type but also the block's locations. Then, we sort the blocks based on this combination, ensuring that blocks with identical data types but different locations are properly handled.

This updated logic will address the issue and ensure that `DataFrame.equals()` returns the correct result when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
