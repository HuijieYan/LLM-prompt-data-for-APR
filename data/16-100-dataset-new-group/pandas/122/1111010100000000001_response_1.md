The buggy function is a part of the BlockManager class within the pandas library. The equals function is used to compare two BlockManager objects, checking if they are equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. In the comparison of the axes of the two BlockManagers.
2. In the comparison of the blocks of the two BlockManagers.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the axes and blocks of the two BlockManagers, leading to incorrect equality checks.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the axes and blocks needs to be re-implemented to ensure that the equality checks are performed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._consolidate().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer.tolist())

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of axes is unchanged, but the comparison of blocks is modified to ensure that the blocks are properly consolidated and checked for equality. This corrected version should address the issues with the original buggy function.
