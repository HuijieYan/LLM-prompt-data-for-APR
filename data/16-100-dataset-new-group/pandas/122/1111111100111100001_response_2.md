The buggy function is the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. When the `equals` method is called with input DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, it raises an AssertionError in the test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False`. 

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not correctly comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` for equality. It is currently returning the opposite of the correct result due to the erroneous comparison logic.

To fix the bug, I will modify the `equals` method to compare the DataFrames `self` and `other` for equality by iterating through their blocks and checking for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the DataFrames for equality and pass the failing test.
