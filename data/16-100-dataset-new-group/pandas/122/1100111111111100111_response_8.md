The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` for the given test case. The issue reported on GitHub confirms that the expected output for the test case is `False`.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type and locations, but it seems there could be an issue with the sorting logic.

To fix the bug, the sorting logic in the `canonicalize` function should be revised to ensure that it correctly sorts the blocks by type and locations. Additionally, the comparison logic at the end of the `equals` function should be reviewed to ensure that it compares the blocks accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
