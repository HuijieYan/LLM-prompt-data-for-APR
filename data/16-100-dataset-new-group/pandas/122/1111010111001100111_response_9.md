Based on the given information, the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to wrongly return True in cases of identical blocks with different locations. The bug occurs when comparing two DataFrames with the same data but with the columns swapped, resulting in a `True` return value when it should be `False`.

The issue arises from the comparison logic implemented in the `equals` function when dealing with different block locations within the internal data structures. It appears that the function does not properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to be revised to correctly account for the case where the order of blocks is different due to the column swapping.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare blocks based on data and not on block locations
    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison is based on the sorted order of the blocks' values to ensure that the comparison is not affected by block locations. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result when comparing DataFrames with swapped column data.
