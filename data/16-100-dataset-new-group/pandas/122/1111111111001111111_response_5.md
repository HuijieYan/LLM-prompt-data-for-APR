Based on the provided information, the bug in the "equals" function is causing the function to incorrectly return True in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations. This differs from the expected output of False, as demonstrated in the failing test. The issue has been reported on GitHub, and we will address it by fixing the bug in the "equals" function.

One potential error location within the buggy function is the sorting of the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" using the "canonicalize" function. The "canonicalize" function combines the type name and "mgr_locs" to distinguish unconsolidated blocks, but the comparison is causing issues.

To fix the bug, we can modify the "canonicalize" function to properly distinguish identical blocks with different locations. We should consider using a different criterion to sort the blocks.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Use a different sorting criterion to distinguish blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: id(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: id(block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the "canonicalize" function has been replaced with a lambda function that uses the "id" of the block to sort the blocks. This should address the issue and ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly distinguished.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
