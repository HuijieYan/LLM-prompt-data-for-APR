The buggy function `equals` has an issue that causes it to fail when comparing two DataFrames. The issue seems to be related to the sorting of the blocks and the equality checking of the blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` checks if two DataFrames are not equal and the assertion fails with the error message `assert True is False`.

The cause of the bug is that the canonicalization of the blocks is not done correctly, leading to the incorrect comparison of the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly sort and compare the blocks of the DataFrames, ensuring that the comparison is done based on the actual data in the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on actual data
    def sort_key(block):
        return (
            block.values,
            block.index,
            block.columns,
            block.dtypes
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and
        block.index.equals(oblock.index) and
        block.columns.equals(oblock.columns) and
        block.dtypes.equals(oblock.dtypes)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test should pass, as the comparison of the DataFrames is now based on the actual data within the blocks.
