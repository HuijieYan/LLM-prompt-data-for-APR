The issue reported on GitHub involves the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returning True in cases of identical blocks with different locations. The code provided in the issue's description includes a test where `df3.equals(df4)` is expected to return False, but it returns True instead.

The buggy function `equals` tries to compare two objects by their attributes, `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The bug seems to arise from the fact that this comparison is not taking into account the order or the locations of the blocks within the DataFrame, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `equals` function to include a check for the order and location of the blocks when comparing them. This can be done by extending the comparison to consider the order and location of the blocks in addition to their attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = list(enumerate(sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)))
    other_blocks = list(enumerate(sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)))

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        idx1 == idx2 and block.equals(oblock) 
        for (idx1, block), (idx2, oblock) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we create a list of tuples `(index, block)` for both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` after sorting them. Then, we compare not only the attributes of the blocks but also their indices to ensure that the order and location are considered in the comparison.

This should address the issue reported on GitHub and the function should now correctly return False for the test case provided.
