The issue here is that the `equals` method of the DataFrame is returning True when it should be returning False due to the differences in block locations between the dataframes. This is causing an assertion error in the failing test.

The bug is likely caused by the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on both their data type name and their locations. This sorting could change even when the content is the same due to different block locations, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the data type name for sorting, excluding the block locations. This change will ensure that the sorting is based solely on the content of the blocks, allowing the `equals` method to correctly identify differences.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the type name to sort
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly identify differences in block content and return False when there are differences, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
