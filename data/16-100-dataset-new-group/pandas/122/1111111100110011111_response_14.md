Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = [axis._get_reindexed_data_for_another_manager(self, data, other_axes) for axis in self.axes]
    other_axes = [axis._get_reindexed_data_for_another_manager(other, data, self_axes) for axis in other.axes]
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
The bug was caused by incorrect usage of the `self.axes` and `other.axes` variables, which were not properly reindexed. This resulted in incorrect comparison of the block axes, leading to a false positive in the equality check.

To fix this, I modified the function to correctly reindex the axes using the `_get_reindexed_data_for_another_manager` method, ensuring that the comparison is done accurately.

This corrected version addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and should now pass the failing test case.
