The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManager objects. Based on the test case, it seems that the comparison is failing because the blocks are not being sorted correctly.

The bug is likely to be at the sorting stage, where the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to create a key for sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the class and once as a separate function. The separate function `canonicalize(block)` is used instead of the class method `canonicalize(block)`, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, remove the separate `canonicalize` function and use the `canonicalize` method defined within the class to generate the key for sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
# ... (previous code remains unchanged)

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Use the class method to generate the key for sorting the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)  # Note: There was a typo here. Should be other.canonicalize instead of canonicalize
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
