## Correction:

The issue in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The bug is likely occurring when checking the equality of individual blocks between the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects. Specifically, the issue may be related to the inconsistent handling of block locations during comparison.

To fix this bug, I would suggest adjusting the implementation of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class to ensure that it correctly handles the comparison of blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(), block.values.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is modified to combine the block locations and values into a tuple, using `tobytes()` to ensure consistent comparisons even when the block locations are different.

This adjustment should address the inconsistency in the comparison of the blocks' locations, ensuring that the `equals` function correctly identifies cases where identical blocks with different locations should return `False`.

This corrected function should pass the failing test case, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
