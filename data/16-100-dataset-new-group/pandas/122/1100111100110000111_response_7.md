### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. The comparison of each pair of axes using `ax1.equals(ax2)` within the `all()` function.
3. The comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
4. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function which uses `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be in the comparison and sorting of the blocks within the `equals` function. It results in incorrect comparison and sorting of the DataFrame blocks, causing the `equals` function to wrongly return `True`.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Compare the columns directly instead of comparing the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Implement a proper comparison mechanism within the `equals` function to compare the DataFrame blocks accurately.
3. Check the sorting mechanism using `canonicalize` to ensure it correctly compares and sorts the blocks.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not all(self.columns.equals(other.columns)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.to_list())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version directly compares the columns of the DataFrames and fixes the comparison and sorting issues within the blocks, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
