The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to improperly return `True` instead of `False` for two DataFrames that are not equal. The issue is related to the comparison of the underlying blocks in the DataFrames.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function doesn't properly compare the blocks in the DataFrames. The function attempts to canonicalize block order using a tuple combining the type name and manager locations, but there is a mistake in sorting the blocks. This results in an incorrect comparison of the DataFrames.


To fix the bug, the sorting of blocks needs to be revised to properly compare the DataFrames. We need to ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted before comparing them to determine if the DataFrames are equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this revised version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames and return `False` when the DataFrames are not equal. This should resolve the GitHub issue and ensure that the function satisfies the expected input/output values.
