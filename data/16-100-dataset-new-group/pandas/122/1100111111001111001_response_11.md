The bug in the given code is caused by the 'canonicalize' function being defined twice in the same class with different variable scope. This results in the 'canonicalize' function from the class not being used within the 'equals' function, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to remove the 'canonicalize' function from the 'BlockManager' class and only rely on the 'canonicalize' function defined outside the class.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions)

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version, the code will now use the 'canonicalize' function defined outside the class as intended, resolving the bug and enabling the failing test to pass.
