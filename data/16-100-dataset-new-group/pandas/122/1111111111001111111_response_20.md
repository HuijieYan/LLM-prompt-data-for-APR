To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the comparison of blocks with different locations that is causing the incorrect return value. The issue is related to the ordering of the blocks, which causes equal blocks with different locations to be mistakenly identified as unequal.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to sort the blocks based on their content and then compare them to ensure that equal blocks are correctly identified as such, regardless of their positions.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on their content to ensure consistent comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly identify the equality of DataFrames, resolving the issue described on GitHub and passing the failing test.
