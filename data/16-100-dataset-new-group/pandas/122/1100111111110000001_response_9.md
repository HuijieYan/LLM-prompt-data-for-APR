The bug in the `equals` function seems to be caused by potential issues in comparing and sorting the blocks of two DataFrames. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, and the mismatched elements are printed as well. This suggests that the comparison operation in the `equals` function is not producing the expected result.

One strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the comparison and sorting operations on the blocks are done correctly to guarantee the equality comparison of the DataFrames. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function should also be corrected to generate consistent and comparable results for all block types.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a consistent representation of the block values for comparison and sorting. Additionally, the `get_values()` method is used to retrieve the block values for comparison, ensuring that the equality comparison is done correctly.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected result.
