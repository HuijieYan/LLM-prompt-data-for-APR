The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to produce an `AssertionError`. This is due to the function returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing dataframes `df1` and `df2`.

The cause of the bug is in the `canonicalize` function where it incorrectly combines the type name and `mgr_locs` to determine block order. This can lead to unconsolidated blocks having the same order, causing the incorrect comparison.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to use a more reliable method to determine block order. One possible strategy is to compare the blocks directly without relying on the combination of type name and `mgr_locs`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass and the function should return the expected output. Additionally, this fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the bug in `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
