The issue with the `equals` function is that it is not correctly handling the comparison of DataFrames. It is comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames in a way that doesn't account for different block locations. This issue is causing the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the block locations are different.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly handle the comparison of the blocks, taking into account their locations.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.items()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are considering the block locations when comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames. We use the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks to ensure that the comparison takes into account the block locations.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly handle comparisons of DataFrames with different block locations, and the failing test should pass. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
