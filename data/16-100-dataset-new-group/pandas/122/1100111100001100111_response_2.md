The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances, even though the blocks have identical values but different locations. 

The bug occurs in the `equals` function where it compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The `equals` function sorts the blocks of each `BlockManager` instance using the `canonicalize` function, which in turn uses the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not used consistently across all blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is used consistently across all blocks during the comparison process and that the block order is based on both the block type (dtype name) and its locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function combines the dtype name and `mgr_locs` of the block in a tuple for consistent ordering. Additionally, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not converted to a list using `as_array.tolist()` as it was in the previous version, ensuring consistency in the comparison process.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
