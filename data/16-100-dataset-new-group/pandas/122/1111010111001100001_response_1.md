The bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class seems to be related to the comparison of the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" lists. These lists are constructed by sorting the "self.blocks" and "other.blocks" lists with a custom key function "canonicalize". The bug may be caused by incorrect sorting or comparison of the blocks.

Upon analyzing the failing test function, we can see that it compares two DataFrames that have different column types and values. This test fails, indicating that the equals method is not correctly handling the comparison of the block data within the BlockManager class.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks in the equals method aligns with the logic of dataframe comparisons in Pandas. We can revise the method to compare the indexes, column names, and data within the blocks to determine if the BlockManager instances are equal.

Here's a corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if all blocks are equal
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, and then iterates over each block to check if they are equal, leveraging the "equals" method directly from the blocks.

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass as it correctly handles the comparison of BlockManager instances.
