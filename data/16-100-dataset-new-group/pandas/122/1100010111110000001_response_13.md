The bug in the `equals` function causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to assert that `df1.equals(df2)` is False, but it returns True instead. This means that the two dataframes are considered equal when they should not be.

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic of comparing the dataframes' axes, consolidating them, and comparing their blocks. There is also a possibility of error in the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on their properties.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function may not be correctly comparing the dataframes' axes and blocks due to improper consolidation and sorting.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be modified to properly compare the axes and blocks of the dataframes. Ensuring that the consolidation and sorting are done correctly is crucial to accurately determine the equality of the dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures proper consolidation of the dataframes before comparison, correctly compares the axes and blocks, and effectively sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
