The buggy function contains a nested `canonicalize` function that is defined twice, once inside the `BlockManager` class and once outside of it. This can cause confusion and lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function is using attributes of `block` which are not defined within the function and might not be accessible.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the duplicate `canonicalize` function from the `BlockManager` class to avoid confusion and potential conflicts.
2. Ensure that the `canonicalize` function is only using attributes and methods that are accessible from within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.values.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the nested `canonicalize` function only uses the `values` attribute of the block to create a unique representation for sorting blocks. This should avoid potential issues with unaccessible attributes and conflicting function definitions.
