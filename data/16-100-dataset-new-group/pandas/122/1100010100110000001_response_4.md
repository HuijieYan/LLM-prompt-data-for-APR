The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames `self` and `other` to check if they are equal. The error message is indicating that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, showing that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is returning `True` instead of `False`.

The potential error location within the `equals` function could be in the comparison of the values of the DataFrames using the `equals` method for blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy implementation of the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the DataFrames, leading to the incorrect assertion result.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to also compare the index and column labels of the DataFrames in addition to comparing the values. This will ensure that all aspects of the DataFrames are considered for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Check index and column labels
    if not self.index.equals(other.index):
        return False
    if not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including checks for the index and column labels in addition to the existing checks, the corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test.
