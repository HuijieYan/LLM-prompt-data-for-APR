Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations. 

Looking at the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class, it seems like the issue might be related to the comparison of blocks. The sorting of the blocks based on `canonicalize` function and the subsequent comparison using `block.equals(oblock)` might be causing the problem.

To fix the bug, we can modify the canonicalize function to incorporate the block's locations as well, so that the comparison takes into account not only the type name but also the locations of the blocks. Additionally, we can update the comparison of blocks to compare their content rather than just the blocks themselves.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.get_values().tostring(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the block's values and their locations. Then, during the comparison, we check if the values of the blocks are equal rather than just comparing the blocks themselves.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `equals` method behaves as expected during the failing test execution.
