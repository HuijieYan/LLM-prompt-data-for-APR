The issue with the `equals` function is that it incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This results in failing the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()`. The function fails to consider the order of blocks leading to incorrect comparisons and returning `True` instead of `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to account for the block locations to ensure correct comparisons. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location in addition to its type name. This will ensure that unconsolidated blocks with different locations are properly distinguished.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function will now properly consider the block locations when comparing DataFrames and return the correct result. This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
