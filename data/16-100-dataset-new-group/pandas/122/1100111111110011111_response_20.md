The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that are actually not equal. This is because the bug is in the logic that compares the blocks within the DataFrames.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue is in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function is not properly accounting for the different values of the blocks in the DataFrames, leading to incorrect comparisons and the incorrect return value.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to properly account for the content of the blocks. This can be achieved by incorporating the values of the blocks into the tuple that is used for sorting the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and 
    # the values within the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block)
  
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the DataFrames based on the values within their blocks, thereby addressing the bug.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
