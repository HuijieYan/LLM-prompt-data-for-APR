The bug in the function equals is causing the failing test test_dataframe_not_equal to raise an AssertionError. The function compares two DataFrames, df1 and df2, and returns True when it should return False. This is likely due to an issue in the equality comparison logic.

The buggy function begins by initializing self_axes and other_axes to the axes of the two BlockManagers self and other. It then compares the lengths of the axes, and if they are not equal, the function returns False. 

The root cause of the bug seems to be in the comparison of the blocks of the two BlockManagers. The function uses the sorted method to create self_blocks and other_blocks based on the canonicalize function. Here, canonicalize attempts to create a tuple using the block's dtype name and mgr_locs, but the implementation may not be effective, resulting in inaccurate sorting and ultimately leading to the incorrect comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the canonicalize function's logic to ensure that it correctly represents the unique attributes of the blocks for accurate ordering. Then, we need to compare the sorted blocks to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function accurately represents the unique attributes of the blocks, and the sorted blocks are then compared for equality.
