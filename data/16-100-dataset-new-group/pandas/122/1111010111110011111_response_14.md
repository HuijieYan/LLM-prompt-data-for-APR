The bug in the `equals` function causes it to incorrectly return True when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations. 

Upon analysis, the bug arises when the function sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which uses the `mgr_locs` attribute. This can lead to unconsolidated blocks having different locations but being considered equal.

To fix the bug, the function should not use the `mgr_locs` attribute in the sorting process, as this can lead to incorrect comparisons. Instead, the function should compare the blocks directly without considering the location.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the sorting of the blocks and directly compares each block with its counterpart in the other DataFrame. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result when comparing DataFrames.
