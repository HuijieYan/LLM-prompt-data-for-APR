The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.

The `equals` function compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class to determine if they are equal. 

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` and asserts that `df1` does not equal `df2` using the `equals` method.

The corresponding error message highlights that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` has failed, and it indicates that `assert True is False`, meaning the `equals` method returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect implementation of the `equals` function. The comparison of the dataframes is not considering the values within the dataframe columns, leading to the erroneous result. 

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to compare the values of the dataframes `self` and `other`. It should iterate through the columns and rows to check for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for i, col in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not np.array_equal(col.values, other.blocks[i].values):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through the blocks and checks for equality of the values within the blocks. This ensures that the comparison is accurate and the function returns the correct result.
