Given the GitHub issue and the provided information, it seems that the `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`. This is likely due to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, which is not being handled correctly.

The bug seems to occur when the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks. The `mgr_locs` property of the block is not being correctly processed, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` property is properly handled within the `canonicalize` function for accurate comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_tuples())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `mgr_locs` property of the block is properly handled within the `canonicalize` function using `to_tuples()` method to accurately process the block location information.

This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected behavior of the `equals` function.
