The buggy function is the equals method of the BlockManager class. It takes another BlockManager instance 'other' as input and compares the attributes and blocks of 'self' with the attributes and blocks of 'other'. However, there is a bug in the canonicalize function where the 'block' argument is missing the 'self' prefix.

The bug is causing the function to fail the test_dataframe_not_equal test because it is not properly sorting and comparing the blocks from 'self' and 'other', leading to a False return value when it is expected to return True.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should take 'self' as an argument, and the 'block' variable inside this function should be prefixed with 'self'. Additionally, 'mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()' should be replaced with 'mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()' inside the canonicalize function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(other, block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
