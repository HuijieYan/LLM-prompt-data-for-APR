The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should return `False`. This is happening because the function is not properly comparing the blocks in the `self` and `other` objects. It is failing to reflect the correct equality comparison when the blocks have the same content but different locations.

To fix this bug, the canonicalization process needs to be adjusted to properly compare the blocks and their locations in the `self` and `other` objects. A possible strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to use both the block data and the block locations to create a tuple for comparison. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, block data, and mgr_locs to compare block equality
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, it will properly compare the blocks' data and locations to determine equality, resolving the issue posted on GitHub and ensuring that the failing test case will pass.
