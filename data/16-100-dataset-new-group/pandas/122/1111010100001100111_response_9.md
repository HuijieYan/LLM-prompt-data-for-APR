Potential errors:
1. The function compares the number of axes between `self` and `other`, but it does not handle the case where the axes are in different order.
2. The function sorts the blocks using a custom key function, but it does not consider the possibility of equal blocks with different locations.

Cause of the bug:
The `equals` function only checks if the blocks are identical, but it does not consider their locations. It fails to return the correct result when the blocks have the same elements but different order or location.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Enhance the comparison of axes to check for equality even if the axes are in different orders.
2. Include the location of the blocks in the comparison to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
