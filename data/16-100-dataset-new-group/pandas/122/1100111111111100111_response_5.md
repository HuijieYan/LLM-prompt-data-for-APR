The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test due to the incorrect comparison of DataFrames. 

One potential error location is in the `canonicalize` function, as the `dtype` attribute might not exist for all block types. This could lead to unexpected behavior when sorting the blocks.

Another potential error location is in the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method. There might be differences in block locations that are not being properly accounted for.

The bug is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to produce the error message:
```
E       assert True is False
E        +  where True = <bound method NDFrame.equals of    a  b\n0  1  s\n1  2  d>(   a  b\n0  s  1\n1  d  2)
E        +    where <bound method NDFrame.equals of    a  b\n0  1  s\n1  2  d> =    a  b\n0  1  s\n1  2  d.equals
```

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic and ensure that the blocks are properly sorted and compared.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare the blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs._start, block.mgr_locs._stop, block.mgr_locs._step))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs._start, block.mgr_locs._stop, block.mgr_locs._step))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
