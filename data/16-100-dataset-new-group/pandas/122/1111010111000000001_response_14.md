The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. However, the current implementation is failing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. In the comparison of axes: The function checks the length of `self.axes` and `other.axes` for equality, but it should also check for the equality of the axes themselves.
2. In the comparison of blocks: The function sorts and compares the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, but it does not compare the actual content of the blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not effectively comparing the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. It only partially compares them based on some attributes, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be updated to perform a comprehensive comparison of the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._typ, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the function now iterates through the axes to check for their equality, and it also compares the actual content of the blocks by using the `equals` method for each block.

With these changes, the corrected `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
