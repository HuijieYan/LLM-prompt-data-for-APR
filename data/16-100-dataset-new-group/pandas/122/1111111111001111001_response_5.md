The bug in the provided code is that there is a second function in the "BlockManager" class with the same name "equals" as another function in the same class. This can cause confusion and lead to unexpected behavior during the execution of the code. 

To fix this bug, we should remove the duplicate "equals" function from the "BlockManager" class, and modify the existing "equals" function to incorporate the logic intended to be used in both places.

Here is the corrected version of the "equals" function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By doing this, we only have one "equals" function in the "BlockManager" class, which should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
