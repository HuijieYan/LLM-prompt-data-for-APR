The `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. As a result, the test is failing with an assertion error.

The potential error locations within the `equals` method are:
1. The comparison of the axes of `self` and `other` may not be correct.
2. The comparison of the blocks of `self` and `other` may not be correct.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not properly comparing the data within the DataFrames. It is using a custom sorting based on block properties, which may not accurately reflect the equality of the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to use the existing `equals` method provided by the Pandas library, which is specifically designed to compare DataFrames for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        return False

    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False

    self_consolidated = self.copy()
    self_consolidated._consolidate_inplace()
    other_consolidated = other.copy()
    other_consolidated._consolidate_inplace()

    if not self_consolidated.blocks.equals(other_consolidated.blocks):
        return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, the method first checks if `other` is an instance of the same class as `self`. Then, it uses the `equals` method for comparing the axes and blocks of the two BlockManagers. This approach ensures that the comparison is done correctly based on the internal representation of the DataFrames.
