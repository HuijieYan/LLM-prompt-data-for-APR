The bug in the `equals` function is causing the function to return incorrect results, leading to the `DataFrame.equals()` method returning `True` in cases where the blocks have identical content but are in different locations. This bug is reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, as well as the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly comparing blocks with identical content but different locations, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to account for the unique identifier of the block, ensuring it considers block content as well as their locations. Additionally, we can compare the blocks using an alternative method that takes into account the block content and locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.__hash__(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Adjust the canonicalize function to use block values and mgr_locs as part of the unique identifier

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these adjustments, the function should now correctly compare blocks based on their content and locations, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
