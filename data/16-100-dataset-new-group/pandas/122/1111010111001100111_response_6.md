Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the length of self_blocks and other_blocks with the possibility of unconsolidated blocks may cause an issue.
2. The sorting of the self_blocks and other_blocks using the canonicalize function may not properly handle unconsolidated blocks.

Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function 'equals' compares two BlockManager objects for equality. It compares the axes and blocks of the two BlockManager objects. The failing test 'test_dataframe_not_equal' creates two DataFrames with the same columns but in a different order. The expected result is False, as the DataFrames are not equal, but the buggy function returns True.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not properly handle the comparison of unconsolidated blocks. It sorts the blocks using a canonicalize function, which may not differentiate unconsolidated blocks properly.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the block comparison logic in the 'equals' function to handle unconsolidated blocks properly. This may involve refining the sorting logic or devising a different way to compare the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The buggy function after correction
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
        
    self_blocks_locs = [block.mgr_locs for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_locs = [block.mgr_locs for block in other.blocks]
    
    if set(self_blocks_locs) != set(other_blocks_locs):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.__repr__())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.__repr__())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the 'equals' function should handle unconsolidated blocks properly, ensuring that the comparison between two BlockManager objects returns the expected result.
