## Bug Fix Strategy

1. The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing the blocks in `self` and `other` by using the `equals` method. This leads to incorrect results, as seen in the failing test.
2. To fix the bug, the function should compare the blocks in `self` and `other` by checking their contents to ensure they are equal, rather than comparing their memory locations.
3. Updating the comparison logic to check for equality of block contents is essential to resolve the bug.
4. A corrected version of the `equals` function that compares the contents of the blocks should successfully pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values while addressing the issue posted on GitHub.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Compare the contents of the blocks to check for equality
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].values.equals(other_blocks[i].values):
            return False

    return True
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function now compares the contents of the blocks in `self` and `other` to check for equality. This approach addresses the bug and should result in the correct behavior, satisfying the failing test case and the expected input/output values while addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
