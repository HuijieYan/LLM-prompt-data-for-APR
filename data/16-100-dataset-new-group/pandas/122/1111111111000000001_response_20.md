The buggy function "equals" within the BlockManager class is intended to compare two instances of BlockManager for equality. However, there are a few potential issues in the code that could be causing the bug. Here's a breakdown:

1. In the equals function, the self._consolidate_inplace() and other._consolidate_inplace() calls are made to consolidate the blocks in place, but there is no guarantee that these operations will succeed. If one of the consolidations fails, the comparison will not be accurate.

2. The canonicalize function is defined twice, once in the class and again outside the class. This can lead to ambiguity and potential errors when calling the function.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves addressing the following:

1. Ensuring that the consolidations are successful before comparing the blocks.
2. Removing the duplicated definition of the canonicalize function and handling the block canonicalization process properly.

Based on the analysis, the buggy function "equals" within the BlockManager class can be corrected as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a single canonicalize function within the class to handle block canonicalization
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._block.shape, block._block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these corrections, the equals function should now pass the failing test.
