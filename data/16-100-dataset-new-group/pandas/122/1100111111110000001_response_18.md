The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `equals` is not comparing the DataFrames correctly, leading to the assertion error in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The error message shows that the code is trying to compare `True` to `False`, which results in the assertion error.

The buggy function `equals` attempts to compare two DataFrames by sorting their blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which orders the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. However, due to a bug in the method of calling blocks, these ordered blocks do not represent actual equivalence.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to reimplement the logic inside the `equals` function that compares the DataFrames based on their content, rather than trying to order the blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... other class methods ...

    # This is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        return self.index.equals(other.index) and self.columns.equals(other.columns) and self.values.equals(other.values)
```

With the corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any assertion errors.
