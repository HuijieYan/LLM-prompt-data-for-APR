The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the block location order between two DataFrames. The current implementation of the `equals` function uses a sorting algorithm based on the block's data type and location within the memory manager. However, it is possible for two DataFrames to have identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on their actual values rather than their locations within the memory manager. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub report.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_is_equal = self.values.equals(other.values)
    return self_is_equal
```

By using the `equals` method directly on the `values` attribute of the `BlockManager` instance, we can compare the actual values of the blocks rather than their memory locations.

This fix should address the reported issue and ensure that the `equals` function correctly identifies the equality of DataFrames regardless of the block's locations within the memory manager.
