The bug in the given function `equals` is caused by the incorrect comparison of DataFrame objects `df1.equals(df2)` in the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with different column data.

The issue arises from the comparison logic inside the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, which fails to handle the comparison of the underlying data correctly. The method tries to compare the blocks within each DataFrame in an improper way, leading to the incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to change the comparison logic inside the `equals` method to correctly handle the comparison of DataFrame blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.index.equals(other.index) or not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False
    for column in self.columns:
        if not self[column].equals(other[column]):
            return False
    return True
```

By comparing index, columns, and individual columns of both DataFrames, we ensure a correct comparison of the underlying data and metadata.

This corrected version of the `equals` method should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case mentioned above.
