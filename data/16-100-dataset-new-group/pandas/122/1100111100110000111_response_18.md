After analyzing the buggy function and the information provided, it seems that the bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is caused by the incorrect comparison of DataFrames. The bug causes the method to return `True` even when the DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.

The issue seems to be related to the comparison of individual blocks within the DataFrames. The function `equals` sorts the blocks of the DataFrames and compares them one by one. However, if two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations, the comparison returns `True` incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to handle the comparison of blocks based on their contents rather than their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function for the `BlockManager` class:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # compare blocks by content, not by location
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
            if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
                return False
        
        return True
```

With this fix, the `equals` function now correctly compares the blocks of the DataFrames based on their contents, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are properly handled. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function pass the failing test.
