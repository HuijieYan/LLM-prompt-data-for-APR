The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class from the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file has an issue. The function fails on a test that checks if two dataframes are not equal.

The issue with the `equals` function is that it is not comparing the values of the dataframes correctly. Instead of comparing the actual values within the dataframes, it is comparing the references to the blocks, which causes the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug:
1. The `equals` function should compare the actual values of the blocks within the dataframes, rather than comparing the references to the blocks.
2. The `canonicalize` function used within the `equals` function should also be updated to correctly compare the values of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(blocks):
        # Convert the blocks to a tuple of sorted values for comparison
        return tuple(blocks.values)

    self_blocks = self.blocks.apply(canonicalize)
    other_blocks = other.blocks.apply(canonicalize)

    return self_blocks.equals(other_blocks)
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test should pass without any assertion errors.
