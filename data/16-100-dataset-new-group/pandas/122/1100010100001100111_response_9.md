Based on the GitHub issue and the runtime values and types provided, the bug appears to be related to the `equals` function not returning the expected result when comparing two DataFrames. The issue description indicates that the function returns True when it should return False for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The potential error in the buggy function is the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which might not handle the comparison correctly in some cases.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not account for the order of the blocks in the sorting process, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the order of the blocks in addition to the type name and `mgr_locs`. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are treated as different, preventing the erroneous True result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # modified canonicalize function to account for block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())  # consider the order of blocks

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block order in the sorting process, the corrected function should now return the expected result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
