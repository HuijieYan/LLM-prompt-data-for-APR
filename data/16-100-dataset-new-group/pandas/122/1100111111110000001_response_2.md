The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. However, the function is incorrectly using methods from other classes and contains nested functions without proper closure. This results in the comparison failing and producing an assertion error in the provided test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()`.

The root cause of the bug is the incorrect comparison logic and absence of proper closure for the nested function `canonicalize()`. The function `canonicalize()` used for sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on block attributes is called within the `equals()` method without being accessed correctly.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize()` function should be moved outside of the `equals()` method and defined separately. Additionally, only the `==` operator should be used for comparing equality of the DataFrame objects instead of using `.equals()` method.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other methods from the class

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block == oblock for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )

def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```

With the corrected code, the comparison of `DataFrame` instances using the `.equals()` method should now pass the failing test.
