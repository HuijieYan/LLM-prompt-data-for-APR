The cause of the bug is that the function is not comparing the actual values of the data frames `self` and `other`, but only their axes and block structures. This leads to the function returning `True` even when the data frames contain different values.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks, not just their structure.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.index.equals(other.index) or not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the index, columns, and data within the blocks to ensure that the data frames are equal.
