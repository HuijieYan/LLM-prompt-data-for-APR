The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, there is a bug in the function that causes it to return incorrect results.

The bug occurs when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function returns a tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`, this comparison might not return the expected results.

A potential solution for fixing the bug is to ensure that the comparison logic uses correct and consistent criteria for sorting and comparison of blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name))
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, the `sorted` function now uses a lambda function to create a tuple that combines `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` and `block.dtype.name`. This ensures that the comparison of blocks is done based on consistent criteria.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return the expected results based on the given input parameters and the expected values.
