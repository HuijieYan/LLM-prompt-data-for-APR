The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The use of self._consolidate_inplace() and other._consolidate_inplace() without any context or explanation.
2. The sorting of self.blocks and other.blocks based on the canonicalize function, which doesn't seem to be defined within the class.

The cause of the bug is related to the DataFrame.equals() method wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to update the equals method in the BlockManager class. We should remove the calls to self._consolidate_inplace() and other._consolidate_inplace(), as they seem unnecessary and not related to the comparison of blocks. Additionally, we should define the canonicalize function within the class so that it can be used for sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        # removed unnecessary calls to _consolidate_inplace

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # define the canonicalize function within the class
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block._typ, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # assuming _typ is the block type

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With these changes, the equals method should behave as expected and the failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" should now pass.
