### Cause of the bug
The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return True when it should return False for the test case provided. The function compares two BlockManager objects and is supposed to check if they are equal. However, due to the buggy function, it is not correctly comparing the internal blocks of the BlockManager.

The issue arises from the way the blocks are being sorted and compared. The isEqual method does not account for different orderings of blocks within each blockmanager, potentially leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the sorting and comparison logic for the blocks within the BlockManager's `equals` function needs to be revised. It should account for variations in the order of blocks within the BlockManager and ensure that the equality comparison is done correctly.

### The corrected version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # First, check if lengths of blocks are same
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Next, check if the blocks are totally ordered using index sorting
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    
    # Finally, compare each pair of blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```
In the corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on `mgr_locs` attribute to ensure that they are ordered properly before the comparison. Then, a comparison is performed for each pair of blocks to determine equality.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and fix the failing test case.
