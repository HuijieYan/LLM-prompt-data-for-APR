The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is supposed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class to see if they are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is testing this function by creating two DataFrames and checking if they are equal using the `equals` method, which is ultimately calling the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. However, the test fails with an AssertionError.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class contains a logic issue. This can be seen in the error message, which indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`. This is likely due to incorrect comparisons and data handling inside the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic inside the `equals` function needs to be corrected. It appears that the code is attempting to compare the axes, consolidate the data, and then compare the blocks. However, the comparison logic itself needs to be carefully reviewed to ensure it correctly handles the comparison of all relevant data structures. Additionally, the handling of mixed data types in the blocks should be considered for correction.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By carefully comparing the axes, consolidating the data, and comparing the blocks, the corrected `equals` function should now return the correct result and pass the failing test.
