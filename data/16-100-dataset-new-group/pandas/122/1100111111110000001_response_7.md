The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. 

The `equals` method compares two BlockManager objects by their axes and blocks. However, it has some issues that cause it to fail the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test. The main issue is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the `BlockManager` class and once outside of it. This causes ambiguity when calling the `canonicalize` function, as it may not reference the intended function.

To fix this bug, the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function should be removed, and all calls to `canonicalize` within the `equals` method should reference the correct function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def _canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=_canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=_canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class should now pass the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test.
