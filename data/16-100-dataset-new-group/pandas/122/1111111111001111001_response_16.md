The bug in the given function is likely due to the incorrect order of blocks in the self.blocks and other.blocks tuples before the comparison. The canonicalize function that is meant to order the blocks by dtype name and mgr_locs is not being called properly. This is causing the blocks to be compared in the incorrect order, leading to a False result, even when the DataFrames should be equal based on the value of their blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalize function is called on each block before they are sorted and compared.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the blocks in the expected order and return the correct result for the test case provided.
