The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test. The bug is in the `canonicalize` function, where it tries to sort the blocks but might create inconsistencies due to unconsolidated blocks. This causes a false negative when comparing DataFrames, as shown in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

To fix this bug, we need to create a consistent way to sort the blocks for comparison. We can achieve this by consolidating the blocks before sorting them, ensuring that they are in a consistent state before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks before sorting for consistency
    consolidated_self_blocks = [block.consolidate() for block in self.blocks]
    consolidated_other_blocks = [block.consolidate() for block in other.blocks]
    
    # Sort the consolidated blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(consolidated_self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(consolidated_other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output values.
