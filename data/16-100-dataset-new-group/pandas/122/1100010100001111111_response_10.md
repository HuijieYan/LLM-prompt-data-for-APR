The bug in the `equals` function is causing the DataFrame.equals() method to wrongly return True in cases of identical blocks with different locations. The problem occurs when comparing the order of the blocks within the DataFrame. The bug is causing the DataFrame.equals() method to incorrectly identify DataFrames as identical when they are not due to the order of the blocks within the DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to include the ordering of the blocks as part of the canonicalized representation of the block, so that it can distinguish between unconsolidated blocks with the same data type.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and block data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block values in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the function can distinguish between identical blocks with different locations, as well as different block values. This should resolve the issue of DataFrame.equals() method returning True for DataFrames with different block locations.
