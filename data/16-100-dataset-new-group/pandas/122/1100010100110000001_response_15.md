The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, causing the test to fail.

The potential error locations within the function could be:
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. The comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
3. The sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

The bug is caused by the `equals` method returning `True` when it should return `False`. This probably occurs due to incorrect comparisons in the function itself.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparisons are done correctly, and that the method returns `False` when the two objects are not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Sort the blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

After making these changes, the function should return the correct result and pass the failing test.
