The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two DataFrames and incorrectly returning `True` even when the DataFrames contain different values. The error message in the failing test indicates that `assert True is False`. The GitHub issue confirms this bug, noting that the `equals` method should return `False` when the DataFrames have different values but is returning `True` instead.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Comparing the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Using the `equals` method in the `canonicalize` function.
3. Comparing the sorted blocks of the two DataFrames.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not properly handling the comparison of different DataFrames. This is due to the comparison of unconsolidated blocks that should be considered as different, but are erroneously being treated as the same.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that unconsolidated blocks are properly compared and that the `equals` method accurately compares the values within the DataFrames.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.index.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now correctly uses the block values and index to ensure that unconsolidated blocks are properly compared, and the `equals` method accurately compares the values within the DataFrames. After making these changes, the `equals` method should now return `False` in cases where the DataFrames have different values, resolving the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
