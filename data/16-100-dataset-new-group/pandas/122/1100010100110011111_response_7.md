The issue with the `equals` function is that it is not comparing the DataFrame objects correctly and is returning True when it should be False. The specific error message from the failing test is `assert True is False`, indicating that the function is returning True when it should be False.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. Incorrect comparison logic when checking if all axes are equal.
2. Sorting blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs but not comparing them properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the comparison of DataFrame objects correctly. The `equals` method should compare the DataFrames' data and axes to determine if they are equal. However, the function is not doing this accurately, leading to incorrect results and the failing test case provided.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be updated to correctly compare the DataFrames' axes and blocks, ensuring that their values and types are compared as expected.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs))
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function compares the axes and blocks of the DataFrames correctly and should address the issue reported on GitHub.
