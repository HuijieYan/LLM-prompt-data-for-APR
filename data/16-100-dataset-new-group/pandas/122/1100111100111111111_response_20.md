The buggy function `equals` is failing to correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects and is returning `True` when it should be `False`. The issue occurs when the function erroneously returns `True` due to identical blocks with different locations.

The bug is likely occurring in the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, as the sorting is not taking into account the block locations. This leads to the function falsely returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting process to consider the block locations when comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. This can be achieved by incorporating the block locations into the sorting key used for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # Incorporate block locations into the sorting key
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block locations in the sorting key, the corrected function will now compare the blocks based on their content as well as their locations, thus providing the correct comparison result. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and the failing test case.
