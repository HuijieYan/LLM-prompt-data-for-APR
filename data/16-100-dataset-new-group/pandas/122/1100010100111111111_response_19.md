The bug in the `equals` function causes it to incorrectly return True in situations where it should return False, as indicated by the failing test. The bug seems to stem from the comparison of blocks within the DataFrame in a way that does not account for their actual equality, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this bug, we need to revisit the block comparison logic and ensure that the equality comparison is performed accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block._block_type, block.values)
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the comparison of blocks has been modified to consider the block locations and the block data values as part of the canonicalization process. This modification should address the bug and ensure that the function returns the correct result, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
