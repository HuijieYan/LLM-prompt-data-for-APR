The buggy function `equals` is a method within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Incorrect comparison of the blocks in `self` and `other` without considering different block locations.
3. Failure to canonicalize block order based on type and location.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances, even if the blocks have different locations. This is evident from the failing test, the corresponding error message, and the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to modify the `equals` method to consider the block locations when comparing the blocks and to ensure that the block order is canonicalized based on the combination of type and location.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple with the block's type name and the manager locations, ensuring that it accounts for the different block locations. The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on this canonical order, and the equality comparison is done considering the sorted blocks.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result for comparing `BlockManager` instances.
