The buggy function is the equals() method within the BlockManager class in the file pandas/core/internals/managers.py. This method is used to determine if two BlockManager instances are equal to each other.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Calling the _consolidate_inplace() method of self and other without verifying if it exists.
2. Defining the canonicalize() function twice.

The cause of the bug is that the _consolidate_inplace() method is being called on self and other without verifying if it exists in the class. This could lead to a potential AttributeError if the method doesn't exist. Also, defining the canonicalize() function twice can cause conflicts and lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug:
1. Verify if the _consolidate_inplace() method exists before calling it. This can be done using hasattr() method.
2. Remove the duplicate definition of the canonicalize() function.

Here's the corrected version of the equals() method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if hasattr(self, '_consolidate_inplace'):
        self._consolidate_inplace()
    if hasattr(other, '_consolidate_inplace'):
        other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added the hasattr() checks before calling _consolidate_inplace() and removed the duplicate definition of the canonicalize() function.
