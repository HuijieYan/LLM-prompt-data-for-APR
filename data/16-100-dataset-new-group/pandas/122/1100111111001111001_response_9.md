The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. It is due to the improper implementation of the `canonicalize` function inside the `BlockManager` class, which results in incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be moved outside of the `equals` function so that it can be accessed by both `BlockManager` and the outer function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
