The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of two DataFrames using the `equals` method, leading to an unexpected return value of `True` instead of `False`. The issue seems to be caused by the sorting of blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This sorting could lead to identical blocks with different locations being incorrectly identified as not equal.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to also consider the block's values when creating the tuple. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block values in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue. This should cause the failing test case to pass and resolve the issue.
