# The bug in the "equals" function:
The bug is causing the "equals" function to return True for two DataFrames that are actually not equal. The bug is likely in the comparison logic when the function compares the individual blocks of the DataFrames.

# Potential error location:
The potential error could be in the sorting and comparison of the blocks using the "canonicalize" function.

# Cause of the bug:
The bug causes the "equals" function to incorrectly return True for the DataFrames that have differently ordered columns.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the blocks of DataFrames needs to be updated to consider the order of columns as well.

# Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Updated comparison logic for individual blocks
    self_blocks = [(blk._get_values(), blk._values) for blk in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(oblk._get_values(), oblk._values) for oblk in other.blocks]
    return all(
        self_blocks[i] == other_blocks[i] for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```

This corrected version of the function includes a modified comparison logic for individual blocks, which compares the values of the blocks directly and considers the order of columns. With this modification, the function should now pass the failing test.
