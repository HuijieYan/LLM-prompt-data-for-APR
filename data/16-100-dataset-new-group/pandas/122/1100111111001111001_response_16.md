The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type and location. However, the expected input/output values indicate that the "block" and "block.mgr_locs" variables are not correctly sorted and compared, leading to the failing test scenario.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly generates a key for sorting the blocks. Additionally, we need to sort the blocks using the generated keys and then compare them pairwise.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function generates a tuple of the string representation of `block.dtype` and `block.mgr_locs`. Then, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on the generated keys, and finally, the blocks are compared pairwise. This should resolve the sorting and comparison issues, leading to a passing test scenario.
