The issue seems to be with the comparison of the axes and blocks of the two dataframes. The comparison is not considering the specific values of the axes and the blocks, leading to false negatives in the test.

To fix this, we need to compare the specific values within the axes and blocks, rather than just their references.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.values), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This version of the `equals` function compares the specific values within the axes and blocks for equality, ensuring that the comparison is accurate. This corrected function should now pass the failing test.
