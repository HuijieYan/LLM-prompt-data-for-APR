The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison of two dataframes using the `equals` method, which is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`. The function is internally comparing blocks within the dataframes and their locations, which is leading to the incorrect comparison result.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function.
2. The comparison of the sorted blocks in the `all` function.

The exact cause of the bug is the incorrect comparison of blocks due to the unconsolidated blocks being indistinguishable by the iteration order. This leads to the `equals` method returning `True` even when the blocks are not the same.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to properly distinguish between unconsolidated blocks, and the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should be updated to reflect the changes in the `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, taking unconsolidated blocks into account
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, Categorical):
            return (block.categories, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        else:
            return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I have modified the `canonicalize` function to properly distinguish between unconsolidated blocks, taking into account cases such as Categorical data. Additionally, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is updated to use the modified `canonicalize` function.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
