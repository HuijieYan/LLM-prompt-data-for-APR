The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class in the pandas/core/internals/managers.py file. The method is responsible for comparing two BlockManagers for equality.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, and it seems to be indicating that the comparison is returning True when it should be False.

Looking at the code, the potential error locations are:
1. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may not be working as intended.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function might not be producing the correct order for comparison.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager. It appears that the comparison logic is not correctly handling the content within the blocks.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic and the sorting of blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on the data for comparison
    self_blocks_data = [(block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [(block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in other.blocks]

    self_blocks_data.sort()
    other_blocks_data.sort()

    return self_blocks_data == other_blocks_data
```

In the corrected version, we are sorting the blocks based on their values and `mgr_locs` to ensure consistent comparison. Then, we directly compare the sorted data to check if the BlockManagers are equal.

This corrected version should ensure that the comparison logic works as intended and passes the failing test.
