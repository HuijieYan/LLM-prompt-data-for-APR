## Bug Analysis
The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is failing because the `equals` function is incorrectly returning True for two `DataFrame` objects that have identical blocks with different locations.

The buggy function first compares the lengths of the axes of the `self` and `other` objects. If the lengths are not equal, it immediately returns False, indicating that the objects are not equal.

Then, it iterates through each axis, checking if they are equal. If any pair of axes is not equal, it returns False.

After that, it consolidates the inplace for both `self` and `other`. This could potentially alter the internal state of the objects, impacting the subsequent comparison.

Next, the function checks the lengths of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If they are not equal, it returns False.

Finally, the function attempts to compare the individual blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` by canonicalizing the blocks using a sorting strategy, and then comparing each block with its counterpart in the other `BlockManager`.

The potential issues in the function are:
1. The inplace consolidation of `self` and `other` might be altering the internal state, leading to incorrect comparisons.
2. The sorting and comparison of the blocks may not be correctly identifying the blocks that are identical but have different locations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the inplace consolidation of `self` and `other` should be modified or removed to avoid altering the internal state before comparison. Additionally, the sorting and comparison of the blocks should be reviewed to ensure that it accurately identifies identical blocks with different locations.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Skip the inplace consolidation step

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Instead of sorting and comparing blocks, compare them directly
    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other.blocks) for block in self.blocks
    )
```

In the corrected version, the inplace consolidation step is skipped to prevent altering the internal state of the objects. The comparison of blocks is simplified to directly check if any block in `self.blocks` equals any block in `other.blocks`, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified.
