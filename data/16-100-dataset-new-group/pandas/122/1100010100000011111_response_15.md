The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function used to sort and compare the blocks is not taking into account the locations of the blocks, leading to identical blocks with different locations being incorrectly deemed equal. This is causing the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the locations of the blocks when sorting and comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    # including the block type name and locations to differentiate unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now includes the locations of the blocks when sorting and comparing them. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be correctly identified as unequal, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
