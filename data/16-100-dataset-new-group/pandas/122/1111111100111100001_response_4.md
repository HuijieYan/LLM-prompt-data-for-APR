The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise. The function fails because it returns `True` while it is expected to return `False` for the failing test case.

The cause of the bug seems to be in the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. The bug is likely related to how the blocks are being sorted and compared.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is correctly implemented. Consider implementing a more robust comparison method for the blocks to ensure their equality is calculated accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function appropriately handles the sorting of the blocks, considering the type name and `mgr_locs` to ensure a consistent and accurate sorting. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result.
