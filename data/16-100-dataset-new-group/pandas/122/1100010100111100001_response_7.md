The bug in the provided function is causing the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test to fail with the error message `assert True is False`. This indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The bug is likely caused by the sorting process of the blocks. The `canonicalize` function is supposed to standardize the sorting order of the blocks using a tuple that combines the type name and the `mgr_locs`. However, it seems that this canonicalization process is not functioning as intended, causing the comparison to return `True` when it should be `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the canonicalization process to ensure that the sorting order accurately represents the equality of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function returns a tuple that combines the block type name and the `mgr_locs` without converting it to a list. This ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their type and location, accurately representing their equality.

After applying this correction, the function should return the correct result, allowing the failing test to pass.
