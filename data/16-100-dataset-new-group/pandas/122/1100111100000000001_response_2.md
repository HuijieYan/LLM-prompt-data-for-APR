The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The purpose of this method is to compare two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. There is a missing `self` parameter in the `canonicalize` method call.
2. The `as_array` and `mgr_locs` attributes might not be accessible in the `canonicalize` method call.

The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that the `canonicalize` function is expected to take a `block` parameter, but the method defined inside the `BlockManager` class is not taking any parameters. Additionally, it seems that there are issues with accessing the `as_array` and `mgr_locs` attributes inside the `canonicalize` function.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` method should be defined properly to take the `block` parameter and ensure that the `as_array` and `mgr_locs` attributes are accessible within the method.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been defined properly to take the `block` parameter, and the `as_array` attribute is accessed using the correct syntax.
