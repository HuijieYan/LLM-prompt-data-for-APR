The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing to correctly identify and compare block locations, resulting in incorrect output for the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely located in the sorting and comparison of self_blocks and other_blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` in some cases where the blocks have the same values but different block_locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks based on their content and also their locations. Sorting should consider both the type name and the block locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should correctly handle the comparison of blocks based on both their content and their locations. It should resolve the issue and ensure that the function produces the expected output for the failing test case.
