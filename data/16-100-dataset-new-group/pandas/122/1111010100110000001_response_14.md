The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of axes length may not be handling cases where the axes are not equal.
2. There could be an issue with the consolidation of blocks and the comparison of these blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the sorting of blocks is not being handled correctly, leading to the comparison returning `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that both BlockManager objects are in a consistent state before comparison and to sort and compare the blocks in a way that accurately represents their equality.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block._equals(other_block) for block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. Added a call to `_consolidate_inplace` for both `self` and `other` to ensure the blocks are consolidated before comparison.
2. Changed the `canonicalize` function to include the type name of the block and manager locations.
3. Changed the comparison to call `_equals` method on each pair of blocks and return `False` if any pair is not equal.

These changes should address the sorting and comparison issues, fixing the bug. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
