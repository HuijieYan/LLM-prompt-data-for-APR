Based on the provided information, the bug in the equals function is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of the DataFrame blocks' locations. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem, where the equals function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is consistent with the failing test and the specific case analysis provided.

To fix the bug, the equals function should be updated to properly compare the blocks' content and locations. Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare the blocks' content and locations
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
        if not self.blocks[i].mgr_locs.equals(other.blocks[i].mgr_locs):
            return False

    return True
```

This updated version should fix the bug by comparing both the content and the locations of the blocks. This will ensure that the equals function returns the correct output for comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
