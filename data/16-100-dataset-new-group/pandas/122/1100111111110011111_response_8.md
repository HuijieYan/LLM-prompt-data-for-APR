The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the `canonicalize` function not being scoped correctly. It is defined both outside and inside the `BlockManager` class, which may cause confusion and lead to incorrect sorting of the blocks. 

Additionally, the test case "df1.equals(df2) is False" fails to return as expected, producing an AssertionError as shown in the error message. 

To fix the bug:
- Remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function inside the `BlockManager` class.
- Correct the scoping issue for the `canonicalize` function in relation to the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # corrected scoping of the canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Also, this fixes the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
