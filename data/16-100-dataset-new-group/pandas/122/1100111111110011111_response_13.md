There seems to be an issue within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file of the Pandas library. The problem is related to the way it compares two DataFrames, causing it to return `True` when it should return `False`.

The issue is identified in this GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The user expected the `equals` method to return `False` for two different DataFrames, but it returned `True`.

The problem seems to be within the implementation of the `equals` method, where it is comparing different blocks in an incorrect manner. To fix this issue, the comparison of blocks and their locations needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider both the dtype name and mgr_locs, we ensure that different blocks with different locations will be correctly distinguished when comparing DataFrames. This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
