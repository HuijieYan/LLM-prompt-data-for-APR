The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that it wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. The issue arises when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different block locations, which should return `False` but incorrectly returns `True`. This is due to the way the `equals` function compares the blocks in the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly check for identical blocks with different locations. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on a unique identifier and then comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if set(map(type, self.blocks)) != set(map(type, other.blocks)):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `equals` function, the bug described in the GitHub issue should be resolved, and the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any issues.
