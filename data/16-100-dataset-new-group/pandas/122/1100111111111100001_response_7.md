The bug in the given function seems to be related to the comparison of the 'self' and 'other' blocks in the 'equals' method of the BlockManager class. The issue could be caused by incorrect comparison of the 'self' and 'other' blocks due to the sorting of the blocks based on incorrect criteria.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of the blocks is performed based on the correct criteria.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.to_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the sorting of the 'self' and 'other' blocks is now based on the type name of the block and its mgr_locs. This should ensure that the blocks are compared correctly, and the failing test should now pass.
