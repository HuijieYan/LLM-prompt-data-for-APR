The `equals` function is a method of the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure used to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The `equals` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal.

However, the potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The function does not handle the case where `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are empty. This can cause an error when calling `len` on an empty list.
2. The function doesn't handle the case where `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` have different lengths, which could cause an index error when using `zip` to iterate over them.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle edge cases when comparing the blocks between two `BlockManager` objects.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Check if `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are empty and return `True` if they are both empty, indicating that the `BlockManager` objects are equal.
2. Check if the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are different and return `False` if they are, indicating that the `BlockManager` objects are not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        if len(self.blocks) == 0 and len(other.blocks) == 0:
            return True
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
