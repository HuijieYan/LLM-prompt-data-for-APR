The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames to check if they are equal. The bug seems to be caused by the fact that the comparison logic does not account for the actual values of the DataFrames but instead uses the indices and block order to determine equality. This leads to the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`, where two DataFrames with different values are incorrectly deemed equal.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `equals` function to compare the actual values of the DataFrames rather than just their internal structures.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        return False
    if self.shape != other.shape or (self.columns != other.columns).any():
        return False
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

This corrected version compares the shapes and columns of the DataFrames to check if they are equal. Then it compares the values using the `equals` method for the underlying NumPy arrays.

With this correction, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, and the two DataFrames with different values will be correctly identified as not equal.
