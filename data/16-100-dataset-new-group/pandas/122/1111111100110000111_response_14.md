The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class, which is the core internal data structure for implementing DataFrame and Series in Pandas. The function tries to compare the internal data blocks of two instances, but it fails to do so correctly, leading to a wrong output.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison logic when checking the equality of the axes and blocks.
2. The sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function may not be accurate, leading to incorrect comparisons.

The bug causes the `equals` function to return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but have different locations. This is evident from the error message where the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, as it returns `True` instead of `False` as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks based on their actual content rather than their locations. Also, the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function should ensure the correct ordering for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate inplace before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` function correctly consolidates the data blocks using `_consolidate_inplace()` before comparison. It then sorts the blocks based on their content using `values.tostring()` to ensure correct ordering for comparison.

This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the `equals` function return the expected results for comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
