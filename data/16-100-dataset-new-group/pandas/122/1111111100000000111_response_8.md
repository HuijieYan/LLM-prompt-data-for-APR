Based on the GitHub issue and the provided buggy function, the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly returning `True` for two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is a bug that needs to be fixed.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method, which does not take into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not considering the possibility of identical blocks with different locations when comparing two DataFrames. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the unique block's "location" information, which ensures that blocks with the same type but different locations will be treated as different. This will then correctly compare the DataFrames and return `False` when appropriate.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions unchanged)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock)
            for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version includes the updated `canonicalize` function that takes into account both the data type and block locations. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be treated as different, resulting in the correct comparison of the DataFrames.
