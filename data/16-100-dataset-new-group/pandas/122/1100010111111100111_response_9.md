The bug in the equals function is causing it to return True when the expected result should be False. This is clearly identified by the failing test, which asserts that df1.equals(df2) should be False, but the function returns True instead. 

The cause of this bug lies in the canonicalize function, which sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. However, in the case of different locations for identical blocks, the canonicalize function fails to differentiate between them, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to account for different locations of identical blocks. We can achieve this by adding the block items to the canonicalization tuple to provide a unique identification for each block.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and items
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this change, the canonicalization now includes the block items, which allows the equals function to correctly differentiate between blocks with different locations. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
