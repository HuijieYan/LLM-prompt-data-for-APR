The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return an incorrect result, as reported in the GitHub issue. The issue is related to DataFrame.equals() incorrectly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug lies in the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` in the `equals` function. The comparison does not properly account for the block locations, resulting in a false positive.

I suggest the following strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the `equals` function to consider the block locations in addition to the block contents when comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
- This can be achieved by using the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block to provide a more fine-grained comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block locations into the comparison using `mgr_locs`, we ensure that the comparison is based on both the block contents and their respective locations, resolving the issue.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, as well as resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
