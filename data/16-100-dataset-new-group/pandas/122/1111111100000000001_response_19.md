The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class has multiple issues as listed below:

1. It calls a local function `canonicalize` within the class but does not provide the `self` parameter while defining it as a method.

2. It calls the instance method `_consolidate_inplace` without using the `self` keyword.

3. There are potential issues with the comparison logic inside the function, as the attribute `blocks` is not defined within the class.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Provide the `self` parameter for the `canonicalize` method inside the class.

2. Use the `self` keyword when calling the `_consolidate_inplace` method.

3. Define the `blocks` attribute and ensure all the necessary attributes are properly initialized before calling the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: self.canonicalize(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: other.canonicalize(block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Make sure to also initialize the `blocks` attribute and other necessary attributes before using the `equals` function.
