The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` and determine if they are equal. However, the function fails to properly compare and sort the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, which leads to incorrect results.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Inability to properly compare the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances due to unconsolidated blocks.
2. Incorrect sorting of the blocks based on type name and manager locations.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly consolidate and sort the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances before comparing them, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that the blocks are properly consolidated and sorted before the comparison takes place. This can be achieved by consolidating the blocks using the `_consolidate_inplace` method and then sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly consolidate and sort the blocks before comparing them, and it should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.
