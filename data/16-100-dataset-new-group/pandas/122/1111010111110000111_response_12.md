The issue with the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file causes the function to return `True` when it should return `False` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This results in test failures and an incorrect assessment of DataFrame equality.

The problem arises from the comparison of blocks between two DataFrames, where the order of the blocks can affect the comparison result. The `equals` function fails to handle the scenario where the blocks have the same values but are located differently.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between the two DataFrames is done in a way that considers the actual values rather than their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_values = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_values = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_values, oblock_values)
        for block_values, oblock_values in zip(self_blocks_values, other_blocks_values)
  )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the actual values of the blocks using `np.array_equal` to ensure that the comparison is based on the actual content, rather than the block locations.

With this fix, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and no longer encounter the issue reported on GitHub.
