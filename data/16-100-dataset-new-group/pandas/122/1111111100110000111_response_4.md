### Analysis
The error occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The error is related to comparing DataFrames using the `equals` method. The failing test is comparing two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) and expecting the result to be `False`, but it returns `True`. 

The function attempts to compare two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes, consolidating them, and then comparing their blocks. The issue arises from the comparison of blocks since the canonicalization of the blocks doesn't consider the ordering of the elements in the blocks.

### Identified Potential Error Locations
The problematic part of the `equals` method is during the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` without considering the order of the elements within the blocks.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused because the `canonicalize` function for blocks does not take into account the ordering of the elements within the blocks. This results in the comparison of the blocks producing incorrect results. 

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the canonicalization of blocks considers the ordering of the elements within the blocks. This would involve updating the `canonicalize` function to include the ordering information of the elements within the blocks.

### Correction of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the type name, mgr_locs, and the values in block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version of the `equals` method, the `canonicalize` function considers the ordering of the elements within the blocks, using the values in the block as part of the sorting key.

By incorporating the ordering of the block elements, the corrected version of the `equals` method should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
