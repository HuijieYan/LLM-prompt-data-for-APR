The issue in the function is that it does not correctly handle the comparison between DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, causing it to return True when it should return False.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to include block and mgr_locs in the tuple, ensuring that the comparison takes into account both the block's dtype and its location.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected function: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, block, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function takes into account the block and its locations when comparing DataFrames, ensuring that it correctly returns False when the blocks have different locations.
