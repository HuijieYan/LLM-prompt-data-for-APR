The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class has several issues.

1. The function is calling the `canonicalize` function from the same class, but it's not using the `self.canonicalize` syntax which may cause an issue in accessing the local function.

2. The function is comparing the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without first checking if `self_axes` and `other_axes` are None or not, which may lead to a NoneType error.

3. The function is also referencing `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` without checking if these attributes exist or not, which may cause an AttributeError.

4. The `canonicalize` function is redefined within the class without the proper function definition syntax.

To fix the bug, we need to:

- Add a check for `None` value for `self_axes` and `other_axes` before comparing their length.
- Use proper syntax to call the `canonicalize` function from within the class.
- Check if `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` exist before calling them, or handle the AttributeError if they don't exist.
- Properly define the `canonicalize` function within the class.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        if (self.axes is None) or (other.axes is None) or (len(self.axes) != len(other.axes)):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
            return False

        if hasattr(self, '_consolidate_inplace'):
            self._consolidate_inplace()
        if hasattr(other, '_consolidate_inplace'):
            other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, we added checks for `None` values, used the proper syntax to call `canonicalize` function, and used `hasattr` to check the existence of `_consolidate_inplace` before calling it. The `canonicalize` function is also properly defined within the class.
