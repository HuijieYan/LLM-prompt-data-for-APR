The buggy function 'equals' is supposed to compare two instances of the BlockManager class and check if they are equal based on their axes and blocks. However, there are some issues in the implementation. 

Firstly, the function compares the axes of the two BlockManager instances. If the lengths of the axes are not equal, it will return False. Then, it will check if each pair of axes are equal and if not, it will return False. After that, it consolidates the block data in both instances.

The bug in the function might be because of the incorrect comparison of the block data. It sorts the blocks based on their type and location, and then compares the sorted blocks. This approach can lead to incorrect comparisons when the blocks are not exactly the same, e.g., when the order or location of the blocks is important.

To fix this bug, the function could execute a deep comparison of each pair of block data in the two instances to ensure that they are equal, rather than sorting and comparing based on location and type.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the function directly compares each block from 'self' with the corresponding block from 'other' to check for equality. This approach ensures that the block data is thoroughly compared without relying on sorting based on type and location.

This modification should resolve the issue and ensure that the function correctly determines the equality of the two BlockManager instances.
