The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test. The main issue in the code is the incorrect comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples.

The following strategy can be used to fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the order of the blocks within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples are consistent and correctly sorted.
2. Compare the blocks within the tuples based on their data and metadata to ensure that they are equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort and compare the block content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the failing test case should now pass.
