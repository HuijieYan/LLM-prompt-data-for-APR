The bug in the equals() function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with different locations. The GitHub issue specifies that the equals() function wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations, when it should return False.

The buggy function has a canonicalize() method that sorts the block based on dtype name and mgr_locs. This can lead to incorrect comparisons when the blocks are identical but have different locations.

To fix the bug, we should modify the canonicalize() method to only consider the dtype name for sorting and remove the mgr_locs comparison. This would ensure that identical blocks are correctly compared and the function returns the expected value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using dtype.name for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and return the expected output in the provided case.
