### Error Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the function is currently not returning the correct result as evidenced by the failing test case and the corresponding error message. The error message indicates that `df1.equals(df2)` is evaluating to `True` when it is expected to be `False`.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it can be observed that the `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. However, the `canonicalize` function is using the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes to sort the blocks, which might not be an accurate way to determine block equality.

The GitHub issue further confirms that the `equals` function is returning a wrong result in this specific case.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the inaccurate sorting and comparison of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is using the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attributes to sort the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons and causing the function to return a wrong result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use a more accurate method to determine block equality. Instead of relying solely on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we can compare the block data directly to ensure accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been removed, and the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are now compared directly using the `equals` method, ensuring accurate comparison of the blocks. This correction addresses the inaccurate block sorting and comparison, resolving the bug and causing the function to return the correct result.
