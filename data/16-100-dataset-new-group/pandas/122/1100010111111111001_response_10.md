The bug in the `equals` function arises from the fact that the function does not properly compare the values of the two DataFrames (self and other) when checking for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects the function to return False, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal. However, the function incorrectly returns True, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when comparing the DataFrames, the function correctly identifies cases where the DataFrames are not equal and returns False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        return False
    
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.__class__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the `other` DataFrame is of the same type as `self`. Then, we compare the axes using the `equals` method. If any of these comparisons fail, we return False immediately. Otherwise, we proceed with the comparison of blocks as before.

With this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, and the function should return False when the two DataFrames are not equal.
