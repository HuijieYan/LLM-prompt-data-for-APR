The bug in the function `equals` is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two data frames. The issue seems to stem from the sorting operation that isn't being performed correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of the blocks is accurate, and we should prioritize sorting by the block's data type name and then by the manager locations. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function should be defined within the `BlockManager` class.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions from the same class

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Sort blocks by dtype and mgr_locs
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
