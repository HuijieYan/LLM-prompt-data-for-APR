The issue with the buggy function `equals` lies in the comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes`. There seems to be a problem with the comparison of the individual axes and the blocks in the BlockManager.

The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This indicates that the bug might occur in the sorting of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` is correct, and that the sorting of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class attributes and methods)

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
            if not ax1.equals(ax2):
                return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_slice)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if not block.equals(oblock):
                return False
        
        return True
```

In the corrected version:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` is done using a loop to compare each axis individually.
2. The `canonicalize` function now uses the `str` of the `dtype` to ensure a string representation for comparison, and `mgr_locs.as_slice` to get the slice representation.

This correction ensures that the comparison and sorting is done correctly, satisfying the expected input/output values.
