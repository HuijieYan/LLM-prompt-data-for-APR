The bug occurs in the `equals` function that is a member of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises because the function is using unconsolidated blocks for comparison, which results in an incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, the `_consolidate_inplace` function should be called before comparing the blocks, ensuring that the blocks are properly consolidated before the comparison is made.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other class methods...

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this fix, the `equals` function will properly consolidate the blocks before comparing them, which should resolve the failing test case.
