The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is causing `df1.equals(df2)` to return `True` instead of `False` as expected.

The bug is identified in the `equals` function where it is failing to handle the comparison of DataFrames with different block locations but identical data. This is evident from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and the corresponding error message. The failing test is due to the bug in the `equals` function causing it to return `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to properly compare the blocks while taking into account the possibility of different block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._can_hold_identical_data, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function addresses the issue with block comparisons and should now return the expected result of `False` for the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. This fix also resolves the reported GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".
