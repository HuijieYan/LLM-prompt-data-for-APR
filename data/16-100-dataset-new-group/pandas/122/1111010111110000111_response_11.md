To fix the bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, we need to address the issue raised by the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to compare two dataframes using the `equals` method and expects it to return `False` as the dataframes have different values. However, the current implementation of the `equals` method is not checking the values correctly, leading to the incorrect assertion in the test.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not comparing the content of the blocks correctly. It is using the `equals` method of the `Block` class, but not considering the actual values within the blocks. As a result, the comparison of dataframes with different values could erroneously return `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to correctly compare the values within the blocks of the dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.values.equals(other_block.values):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method checks the equality of the values within each block of the dataframes. It iterates through the blocks and compares the values using the `equals` method of the `Block` class.

With this corrected implementation, the `equals` method will correctly compare the dataframes and return `False` for the failing test case.

After making this change, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
