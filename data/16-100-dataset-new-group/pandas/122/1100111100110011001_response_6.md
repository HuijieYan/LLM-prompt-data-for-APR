The issue in the buggy function appears to be related to comparing the equality of two dataframes. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing `df1` and `df2`.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the buggy function is trying to sort the blocks within the dataframes and compare them. However, the comparison logic may be flawed.

The fix for the bug can be achieved by correcting the logic for comparing the blocks and ensuring that the correct sorting and comparison of blocks is performed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared based on their type and `mgr_locs`. This should address the issue of incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing dataframes.
