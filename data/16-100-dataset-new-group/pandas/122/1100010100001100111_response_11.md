The bug in the equals function is caused by the use of the sorted() function, which is not consistent across different runs and platforms, leading to inconsistent results. This bug causes the equals function to return True even when the blocks have different locations, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the sorted() function with a method that will consistently produce the same result no matter the platform. One way to do this is to use a combination of the type and the mgr_locs of the block as a key for sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the function should consistently produce the correct result across different runs and platforms, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
