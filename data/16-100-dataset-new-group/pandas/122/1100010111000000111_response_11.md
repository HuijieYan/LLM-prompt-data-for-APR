The issue reported on GitHub is related to the DataFrame.equals() method, which is not returning the expected output in the case of identical blocks with different locations. The failing test function provided compares two dataframes and expects the result to be False, but the buggy function returns True instead.

The potential error location in the buggy code is the canonicalization of the blocks using the dtype name and mgr_locs. This approach might lead to incorrectly identifying identical blocks with different locations as equal.

The bug occurs because the canonicalization process for the blocks does not take into account the block locations, and it simply relies on sorting by dtype name and mgr_locs. This can lead to incorrect equality comparison of dataframes, as observed in the failing test case provided in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, a revised canonicalization and equality comparison process should consider the block locations as well. This can be achieved by using a combination of block content, dtype name, and block locations to ensure accurate identification and comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the equals() function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a combination of content, type name, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this revised implementation, the equals() function should now accurately identify and compare identical blocks with different locations, ensuring that the failing test case provided in the GitHub issue returns the expected result.
