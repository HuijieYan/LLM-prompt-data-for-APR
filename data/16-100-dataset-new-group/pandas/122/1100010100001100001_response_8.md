The buggy function is intended to compare two BlockManager objects in pandas and return whether they are equal or not. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the lengths of the self_axes and other_axes lists.
2. The comparison of individual axes using the equals method.
3. The comparison of the lengths of self.blocks and other.blocks.
4. The sorting and comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks using the equals method.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly comparing the BlockManager objects. It is incorrectly comparing the axes and blocks without considering their contents.

To fix the bug, we should compare the contents of the axes and blocks in a way that reflects their actual data, instead of just comparing their structures.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through the axes and blocks to compare their contents using the equals method. This ensures a proper comparison of the BlockManager objects.
