The bug within the `equals` function is likely caused by the comparison of DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. The error message indicates that the `equals` function is producing a `True` value when `False` is expected. This suggests that there may be an issue with the comparison logic or with the handling of the DataFrame blocks.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to thoroughly review the logic in the `equals` function, ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is carried out correctly, and verify that the canonicalization of blocks is functioning as intended.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Perform comparison individually for each block
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version should address the issues with the original `equals` function and ensure that the comparison logic between DataFrames is correct.
