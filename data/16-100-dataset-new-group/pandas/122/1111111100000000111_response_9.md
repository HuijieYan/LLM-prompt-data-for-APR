Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue arises from the `BlockManager.equals` function. The function is designed to compare two BlockManager objects for equality, but it erroneously returns True when the blocks are identical but located in different positions. This behavior contradicts the expected output and has been reported as a bug in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location in the buggy function is when it compares the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function does not take into account the actual values of the blocks. It only considers the type name and manager locations, leading to the incorrect comparison when the blocks are identical but located differently.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to also consider the values of the blocks when sorting them. This can be achieved by creating a tuple that combines the type name, manager locations, and block values. Additionally, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be updated to compare the sorted blocks based on their values and not just their positions.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block values into the `canonicalize` function and updating the comparison logic, the corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub. This modification ensures that the equality comparison takes into account the actual values of the blocks, rather than just their locations.
