The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test to fail. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. It mistakenly returns True when the expected result should be False.

The cause of the bug may be related to the sorting and comparison of the `blocks` attribute of the `BlockManager` objects. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, but it might be incorrectly grouping identical blocks with different locations as equal.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the locations of the blocks as well, so that identical blocks with different locations are not wrongly grouped as equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the locations of the blocks, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly grouped together as equal. This should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function behave as expected.
