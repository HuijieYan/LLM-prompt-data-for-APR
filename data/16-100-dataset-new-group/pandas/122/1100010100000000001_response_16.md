    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs[0].tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

Explanation:
The main issue with the original code is that it uses the attribute `block.dtype.name` to compare blocks, which might not be unique for all block types. Instead, using `block.__class__.__name__` will provide a more reliable comparison.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Replace `block.dtype.name` with `block.__class__.__name__` in the `canonicalize` function for a more reliable comparison.

Additionally, the code `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` was changed to `block.mgr_locs[0].tolist()`.

These changes will ensure that the blocks are correctly ordered and compared for equality.
