## Bug Explanation
The buggy function is intended to compare two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks. However, the bug in the function occurs due to the usage of the `canonicalize` function within the function. The `canonicalize` function is defined within the `equals` method, but it is also defined outside the method. This leads to ambiguity in the scope of the `canonicalize` function, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect comparison results.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should either be defined as a standalone function outside of the class or should be moved inside the `equals` function. This will ensure that the `canonicalize` function is correctly used within the `equals` method and does not cause ambiguity in its scope.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the `equals` method now includes the `canonicalize` function defined within its local scope, ensuring that it is properly utilized for sorting the blocks and comparing the BlockManager objects.
