The buggy function is comparing two BlockManager objects by checking the equality of their axes and blocks. The function then sorts the blocks using a canonicalize function, and finally, compares each block for equality.

Based on the runtime input/output values provided, it seems that the bug may be caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks and the sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks and the sorting of the blocks is done correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare each block for equality
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```
