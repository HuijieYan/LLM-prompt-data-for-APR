The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return an incorrect value, leading to the failing test. The bug is likely in the `canonicalize` function or in the comparison of the blocks.

The failing test (`test_dataframe_not_equal`) compares two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` and expects them to be unequal. However, the buggy `equals` function returns `True` instead of `False`. This is because the function incorrectly assesses the equality of the two DataFrames.

The bug occurs because of the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This leads to the incorrect comparison of blocks and the wrong result. To fix the bug, the sorting of blocks and their comparison needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now return `False` when comparing the provided test DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, satisfying the expected input/output values.
