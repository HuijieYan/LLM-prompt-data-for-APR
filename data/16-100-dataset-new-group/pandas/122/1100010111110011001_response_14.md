The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect comparison of two dataframes using the `equals` method. The `equals` method is used to compare the data and the shape of the two dataframes, but it is failing to correctly identify that the two dataframes are not equal.

The issue is with the comparison of the two dataframes df1 and df2. The bug is in the equals function method `canonicalize`, which is used to sort the blocks before comparison. The problem is that it only considers the dtype and mgr_locs of the block, and does not consider the values of the block. This causes the function to incorrectly identify the two dataframes as equal when they are not.

To fix the bug, we need to include the values of the blocks in the sorting process. This can be achieved by using the `values` attribute of the block and including it in the tuple returned by the `canonicalize` function for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and values so that blocks can be distinguished
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the blocks of the two dataframes, including their values, and return the correct result based on the comparison. This correction should also satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
