The buggy function `equals()` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The function is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to determine if they are equal. The error message from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` indicates that the function returned `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. The comparison of lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. The comparison of individual elements in `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
3. Sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
4. The final equality comparison of individual blocks.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the improper comparison and sorting of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. This is indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue, which states that `equals()` wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly handled in the comparison process. This might involve addressing the sorting of blocks and their locations.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, the blocks are sorted based on their values and locations using the `canonicalize()` function. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are properly handled during the comparison process. This corrected version should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values as well as resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
