## Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison between self_axes and other_axes may be causing an issue.
2. Sorting and comparing the self_blocks and other_blocks may be causing the bug.

## Bug Cause
The `equals` function is failing to correctly return False when comparing two DataFrames due to issues with comparing the axes and blocks. This is leading to false positives in DataFrame equality checks.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Fix the comparison between self_axes and other_axes to accurately determine their equality.
2. Update the sorting and comparison of self_blocks and other_blocks to accurately check for equality.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```
