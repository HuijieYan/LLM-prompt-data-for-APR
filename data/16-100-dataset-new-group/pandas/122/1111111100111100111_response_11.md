### Bug Analysis
The `equals` function should return `True` if both objects are equal and have the same shape and elements. However, the failing test demonstrates that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False`. This indicates a bug in the comparison logic.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison logic for `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. The logic for consolidating the blocks in both DataFrames.
3. The `canonicalize` function that is used to sort the blocks before comparison.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` lists. Additionally, the logic for consolidating the blocks and the `canonicalize` function might not be functioning as expected, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Fix the comparison logic for `self_axes` and `other_axes` to ensure they are compared correctly.
2. Update the logic for consolidating the blocks to accurately compare the blocks in both DataFrames.
3. Review the `canonicalize` function and its usage to ensure it correctly sorts the blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate blocks before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the potential issues and should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
