The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, and the returned value is `True` instead of `False`.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return, we can see that the issue arises from the comparison of `df1` and `df2`. The comparison is expected to return `False` because the data in `df1` and `df2` is not equal, but the buggy function is incorrectly returning `True`.

The cause of the bug seems to be the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting affects the equality comparison of the blocks, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix this bug, we can change the sorting and comparison logic in the `equals` method. We should avoid sorting the blocks and instead directly compare the blocks in the same order. This will ensure that the equality comparison is accurate and returns the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` method will compare the blocks directly without sorting, ensuring that the equality comparison returns the expected result.
