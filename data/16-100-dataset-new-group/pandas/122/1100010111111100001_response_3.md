The issue with the `equals` function seems to be related to how it is comparing the dataframes. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different values but the same columns, and then asserts that they are not equal using the `equals` method, which should return `False`.

The analysis of the runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy function suggests that the issue might be related to the way the function is handling and comparing the blocks of data in the dataframes.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be updated to properly compare the dataframes. Specifically, the logic within `canonicalize` and the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might need to be reviewed and adjusted.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, I removed the sorting and `canonicalize` logic and directly compared the individual blocks in the `self` and `other` dataframes. This should properly compare the dataframes and return `False` for the failing test.
