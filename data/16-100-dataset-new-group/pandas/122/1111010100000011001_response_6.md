The cause of the bug is that the buggy function "equals" does not properly handle the comparison of the attributes "self_axes" and "other_axes" as well as the comparison of the blocks within "self" and "other" objects. The current implementation does not ensure that the blocks are compared in a consistent order, leading to potential mismatch in the comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to sort the "self_axes" and "other_axes" lists before comparing them. Additionally, we should sort the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" lists using a consistent key for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    # Sort the axes lists before comparison
    self_axes = sorted(self_axes)
    other_axes = sorted(other_axes)
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a key function for sorting the blocks
    def sort_key(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first sort both "self_axes" and "other_axes" before comparing them. Then, we define a key function "sort_key" for sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and "mgr_locs". This ensures that the blocks are sorted consistently before the comparison. Finally, we compare the sorted blocks in the "self" and "other" objects using the "equals" method.
