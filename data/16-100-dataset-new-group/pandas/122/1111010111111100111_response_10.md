Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it is returning `True`, leading to an assertion error. 

The bug is likely caused by the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. The block order is not being properly canonicalized, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization of block order using a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs` should be revised. This revision will ensure that unconsolidated blocks are properly distinguished during comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly compare the block structures, and the failing test should pass.

This correction should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the unexpected behavior of `DataFrame.equals()`.
