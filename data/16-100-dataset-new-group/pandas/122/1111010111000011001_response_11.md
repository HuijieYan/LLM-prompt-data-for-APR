The buggy function `equals` has two main sections: one for comparing the axes and another for comparing the blocks. The error in the function seems to be related to the comparison of the axes and the sorting and comparison of the blocks.

The buggy function `equals` compares the axes of `self` and `other` and then compares the blocks. If the lengths of the axes are not equal, it returns `False` immediately. After that, it consolidates the data and then compares the blocks by sorting them based on their type and locations.

However, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different data types in the columns, so the expected output for the test is `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function compares the blocks based on the specific values within each block, rather than their types and locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare the blocks based on their values
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(block.to_frame(), oblock.to_frame()) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function compares the actual values within each block rather than their types and locations, ensuring that the correct comparison is made.

Now, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
