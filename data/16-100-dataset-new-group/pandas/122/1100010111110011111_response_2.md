The issue is caused by the buggy `equals` method in the `managers.py` file of the pandas package. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` from `test_internals.py` compares two dataframes using the `equals` method and expects it to return `False`, but instead it returns `True`.

The bug is likely due to the comparison of dataframes with different value types (integers and strings) in the failing test. The `equals` method should account for dataframes with different value types and ensure that it returns `False` in such cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to compare dataframes with different value types correctly. We can achieve this by adding a check to compare the value types of the dataframe columns before performing the equality check.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version adds a new `canonicalize` function to create a unique key for each block consisting of the block's type name, dtype, and manager locations. This ensures that blocks with different value types will be properly distinguished and the equality check will return `False` as expected.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
