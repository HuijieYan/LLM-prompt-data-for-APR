The issue with the `equals` function is that it currently returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. To fix this issue, we need to update the logic inside the `equals` function to account for the block locations when comparing the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a list of tuples containing block type, block locations, and block data
    def get_block_signature(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = [get_block_signature(block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [get_block_signature(block) for block in other.blocks]

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, we create a signature for each block in the DataFrames by combining the block type, block locations, and block values into a tuple. We then compare the signatures for all blocks in the DataFrames.

This change ensures that the comparison takes into account both the block data and the block locations, addressing the issue where DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations were incorrectly being considered equal.

After applying this correction, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test case provided should pass, and the `equals` function should behave as expected.
