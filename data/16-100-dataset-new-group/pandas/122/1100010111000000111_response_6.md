def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The identified potential error locations within the buggy function were:
1. The comparison of block locations using `as_array.tolist()` instead of `tostring()`.
2. The comparison of block types using `block.dtype.name` instead of `str(block.dtype)`.

The cause of the bug was that the original `canonicalize` function didn't handle block locations and types correctly. This led to the `equals` function returning True when it should have returned False in cases where the actual blocks had different locations.

The strategy for fixing the bug involved correcting the `canonicalize` function to handle block types and locations consistently. This was achieved by using `str(block.dtype)` for block types and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring()` for block locations in the `canonicalize` function.

The corrected version of the `equals` function above should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
