The bug in the `equals` function is causing the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test to fail with the error message `assert True is False`. The bug is occurring because the function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is happening because the function is not properly comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames. The issue has been reported on GitHub titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. The comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not be working correctly.
2. The canonicalization of the blocks using the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` may be causing the issue.

The potential cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that the comparison method is not effectively identifying the differences between the blocks of the two DataFrames. This is leading to an incorrect comparison result and causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the block canonicalization process and ensure that the comparison of the blocks is accurately identifying differences, resulting in the correct return value.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.max(), block.mgr_locs.min())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now fulfill the expected behavior and pass the failing test.
