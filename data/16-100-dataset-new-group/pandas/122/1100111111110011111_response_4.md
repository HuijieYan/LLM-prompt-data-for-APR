The buggy function `equals` has a bug where it wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, instead of `False`. This bug is reported in GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The bug is likely located in the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. The issue is caused by the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using a `canonicalize` function which is expected to return a tuple of `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs`. However, the actual implementation of the `canonicalize` function is missing a parameter `self` which should have been included in the method signature.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class needs to be modified to include the `self` parameter. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function should be called with the `self` parameter when sorting the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function to include self parameter
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(other, block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected implementation of the `canonicalize` function, the `equals` function should now return the expected result and pass the failing test case.
