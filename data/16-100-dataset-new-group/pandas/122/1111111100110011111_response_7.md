To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue with comparing identical blocks with different locations. The error message indicates that the function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`.

Looking at the buggy function, the issue is likely related to the sorting and comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. It seems that the comparison of the blocks is not taking into account the potential for identical blocks with different locations, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the blocks to consider their content rather than just their order. Additionally, we should ensure that the order of blocks is consistent between `self` and `other` to accurately compare them.

Let's provide a corrected version of the function below, taking into account the expected values and types of variables.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks based on a key derived from block content and location
    def block_key(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_key)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the buggy behavior by ensuring that the comparison of blocks takes into account their content and location. It sorts the blocks based on a key derived from the block's values and location, allowing for accurate comparison between `self` and `other`. With this correction, the function should now return the correct result when comparing dataframes, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
