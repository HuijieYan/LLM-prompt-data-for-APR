To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue with the comparison of the blocks in the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects. The buggy function is returning incorrect outputs when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

Looking at the function, the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. However, there might be unconsolidated blocks (e.g., Categorical) that can only be distinguished by the iteration order. This implies that the comparison of blocks should consider the contents rather than their location alone.

So, the bug is caused by the sorting of blocks based on `mgr_locs` alone, which is causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered as unequal.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the `canonicalize` function to consider the contents of the blocks as well. Additionally, we should remove the sorting of blocks based only on `mgr_locs`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # create a set of block tuples for self and other BlockManager
    self_block_set = {(b.values, b.dtype) for b in self.blocks}
    other_block_set = {(b.values, b.dtype) for b in other.blocks}
    
    # compare the sets for equality
    return self_block_set == other_block_set
```

In this corrected version, we create a set of block tuples for the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects. Each block tuple consists of the block's values and its data type. Then, we compare the sets for equality, taking into account the contents of the blocks rather than their locations. This approach ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be considered as equal, resolving the bug.

After implementing this fix, the `equals` function should return the expected output, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
