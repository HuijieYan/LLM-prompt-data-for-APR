To fix the bug, we need to address the following issues in the buggy function:

1. The function `canonicalize` is redefined within the `BlockManager` class, which causes ambiguity and may result in unexpected behavior.
2. The usage of `block` and its properties such as `dtype` and `mgr_locs` are not clear.

To address these issues, we can modify the buggy function as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate both instances in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a new function for canonicalization
    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block._block._slice, block.values)
    
    # Sort the blocks with the new canonicalization function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
1. We have removed the redefined `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class to avoid ambiguity.
2. We have added a new function `canonicalize_block` to provide a custom key for sorting the blocks based on their type, slice, and values.
3. We sort the blocks using the `canonicalize_block` function and then compare the sorted blocks for equality.

With these changes, the corrected function should address the issues and pass the failing test.
