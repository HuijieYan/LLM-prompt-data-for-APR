## Analysis
The buggy function is the `equals` method, which is part of the pandas library. The error message is indicating that the `assert` statement in the failing test is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. The `expected` input/output values outline the expected values and types of relevant variables during the failing test execution.

The GitHub issue reports that when running the `df3.equals(df4)` test, it returned `True` instead of the expected `False`. It suggests that the method is not behaving as expected in identifying two DataFrames as being not equal.

## Identified Error
The cause of the bug can be identified in the `canonicalize` function, which generates a tuple combining the type name and the `mgr_locs`. The `equals` method does not consider the order of the columns when comparing DataFrames, which results in incorrect equality determinations.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be adjusted to consider column index/location. Then, the comparison of the DataFrames should take this into account to properly differentiate between blocks.

## Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
  
    return True
```

This corrected function has this addition to the `canonicalize` function:
`return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))`

This change properly addresses the bug by taking into account the block locations when comparing DataFrames for equality. The function should now pass the failing test and properly identify non-equal DataFrames.
