The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks but with different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not taking into account the different locations of identical blocks when comparing DataFrames. This leads to the function wrongly concluding that the DataFrames are equal.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider the locations of identical blocks. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on both their type name and their locations before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will now consider the type name and manager locations of the blocks in the comparison, ensuring that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations will return `False` as expected. This will resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
