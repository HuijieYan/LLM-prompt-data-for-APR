The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class causes it to return `True` even when the blocks have the same data but in different locations. The bug is causing incorrect comparison of blocks, leading to unexpected outcomes for the `equals` method.

To fix the bug:
1. Identify and consolidate the block locations while comparing two `BlockManager` instances to ensure that the comparison is based on the actual data, not the location of the blocks.
2. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the data itself rather than the block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Check if the shapes of the axes are different
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    
    # Check if the axes themselves are the same
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    # Ensure that the blocks are consolidated for comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check if the number of blocks is different
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    # Sort the blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by ensuring that the comparison of blocks is based on their actual data, rather than their locations. This will resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
