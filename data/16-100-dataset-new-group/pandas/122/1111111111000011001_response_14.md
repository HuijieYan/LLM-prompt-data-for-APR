The buggy function `equals` is failing to correctly compare two dataframes. The function contains logic to compare the axes and blocks of two dataframes, but it is not handling the comparison properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly comparing the axes of the two dataframes and is not sorting and comparing the blocks in a consistent manner.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the axes of the two dataframes, sort and compare the blocks, and return the result.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
