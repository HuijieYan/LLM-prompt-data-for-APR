The issue appears to be with the `BlockManager` class's `equals` method, which is inherited from `PandasObject`. When comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, which in turn calls the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, the comparison returns `True` when it should return `False` due to the order of the blocks being different.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function inside the `BlockManager` class's `equals` method does not consider the order of the blocks when comparing two `DataFrames`, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to consider the order of the blocks when sorting them. We can achieve this by using both the `dtype` name and the `mgr_locs` attributes of the block to create a tuple for sorting. Additionally, we need to remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function outside the class.

Here's the corrected version of the `BlockManager` class's `equals` method:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method will now take the order of the blocks into account when comparing two DataFrames, and it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
