There is a bug in the `equals` function of the `pandas` library, which incorrectly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. The issue was reported on GitHub with the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The cause of the bug lies in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function. This function sorts the blocks in the DataFrame by type name and location, which can lead to different blocks being considered equal even if they are not located in the same position.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to take into account the order of the blocks. One strategy to fix this bug is to use the blocks' index as a part of the canonicalization process. This will ensure that blocks are only considered equal if they are located in the same position.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and mgr_locs.index because different locations should not be considered equal
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.index.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the index of each block, ensuring that only identical blocks in the same location are considered equal. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
