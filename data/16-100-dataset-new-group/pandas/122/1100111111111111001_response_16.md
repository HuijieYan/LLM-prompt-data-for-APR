The bug in the equals function is causing the test_dataframe_not_equal test case to fail. The buggy function is not properly comparing the two DataFrames and returning the incorrect result, leading to the failing test.

The bug seems to be in the logic of comparing the 'self_axes' and 'other_axes' using the 'equals' method. It appears that the bug lies in the comparison of 'self_blocks' and 'other_blocks' as well, where the sorting is not producing the correct result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is done correctly to accurately determine if the DataFrames are equal.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.values))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected result, accurately comparing the two DataFrames for equality.
