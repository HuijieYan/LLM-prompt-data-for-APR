The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `False` when it should be returning `True`, resulting in the failing test. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects. It's possible that the sorting of the blocks and the comparison based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` is causing the bug.

In order to fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to handle cases where the blocks are of different types or have different `mgr_locs`. This can be achieved by creating a hashable representation of the block that includes both its type and `mgr_locs`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now return the correct result for the failing test.
