The bug in the given function is likely due to the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the `equals` function and once within the `BlockManager` class. As a result, the inner `canonicalize` function is shadowing the outer function, which might cause confusion and lead to unexpected behavior.

Additionally, there is a missing `self` parameter in the `canonicalize` function defined within the `BlockManager` class, which should be added to match the signature provided in the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, the redundant `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class should be removed, and the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function should be modified to include the `self` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # ... (other class functions)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(self, block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(other, block))
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By making these changes, the `canonicalize` function should behave as intended and fix the bug causing the failing test.
