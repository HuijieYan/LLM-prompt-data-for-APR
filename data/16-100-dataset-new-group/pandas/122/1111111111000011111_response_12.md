The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing to return the correct value when comparing two DataFrames. The bug causes the function to return True even when the two DataFrames have different values.

The bug likely originates from the sorting and comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists, which is not properly accounting for identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, the canonicalize function should be modified to account for the different locations of identical blocks. This can be achieved by canonicalizing the blocks based on their content, rather than their locations.

Here is the fixed version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the function now properly handles the comparison of identical blocks with different locations and should pass the failing test provided.

This fix addresses the issue reported in GitHub and ensures that the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class returns the correct value when comparing DataFrames.
