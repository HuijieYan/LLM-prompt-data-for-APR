The function `equals` takes an object `other` and compares it with the current object. 

The potential cause of the bug seems to be in the `canonicalize` function, where the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` are being used as a key for sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The bug may result from inconsistencies in the order of the blocks, causing the equality comparison to fail.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to ensure that the block order is properly handled and consistent across both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now sorts blocks based on the string representation of the block type and the `mgr_locs` array, ensuring consistent ordering across `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

This approach should ensure that the block order is handled consistently, addressing the potential bug in the original function.
