The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to produce an error message. The issue reported on GitHub confirms that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the given DataFrames.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames, causing the function to return `True` when it should not.

To fix this bug, we can make the following changes to the `equals` function:
1. Ensure that the lengths of the in-memory axes and blocks are checked against the corresponding lengths of the other DataFrame's axes and blocks.
2. Instead of sorting the blocks and comparing them directly, we need to iterate over the blocks in a way that correctly represents the data arrangement.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Check the length of the blocks and their dtype
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        self_block = self.blocks[i]
        other_block = other.blocks[i]
        
        if self_block.shape != other_block.shape:
            return False
        
        if self_block.dtype != other_block.dtype:
            return False
        
        if not np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By checking the length, shaping, and value equality of the blocks individually, we ensure that the function correctly identifies when the DataFrames are not equal.

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass without any error messages.
