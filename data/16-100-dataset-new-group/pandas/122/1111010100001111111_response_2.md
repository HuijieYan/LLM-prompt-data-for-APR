## Correction of the buggy function

The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

The bug in the current `equals` method arises from the fact that it does not correctly handle scenarios where the block locations (mgr_locs) are different but the blocks themselves are equal. This leads to incorrect equality comparisons, which results in the method returning `True` incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be updated to properly handle scenarios where the block locations are different, while maintaining the equality check for the blocks themselves.

After analyzing the provided runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values, it is evident that the `equals` method fails to check for the equality of blocks based on their locations. Therefore, the strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the `equals` method to compare not only the blocks themselves but also their corresponding block locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes a comparison of the block locations using `str(block.mgr_locs)`. This ensures that the block locations are also considered during the equality comparison of blocks. Additionally, the sorted blocks are compared using the `equals` method to account for the possible difference in block locations.

With these modifications, the `equals` method should now accurately compare two `BlockManager` instances, addressing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
