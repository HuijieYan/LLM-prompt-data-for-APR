To fix the buggy function, we need to address its inability to correctly compare two DataFrames using the `equals` function. The comparison should take into account the values and types of the DataFrames without being sensitive to the ordering of columns.

The issue arises from the incorrect implementation of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. The function first compares the lengths of the axes, and if they differ, it returns `False`. Then, it attempts to compare each block in the DataFrames. However, it doesn't handle the case where the columns are in a different order.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to generate a unique key for each block by considering the column names and their corresponding values. Then, we can compare the canonicalized blocks to determine if the DataFrames are equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the column names and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        data = block.values if isinstance(block, Block) else block
        return tuple((col, tuple(data[col])) for col in data)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, we are taking the column names and values into consideration when comparing the DataFrames. Now, the `equals` function should correctly determine if two DataFrames are equal, regardless of the column order. This should address the failing test case, and the expected values and types provided in the test case should now be satisfied.
