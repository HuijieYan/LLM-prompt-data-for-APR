## Correction:

The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function returns a tuple of block type name and `mgr_locs`. However, the `mgr_locs` is not handled properly, which can lead to inconsistencies in the comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the `mgr_locs` during the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs.__hash__())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version handles `mgr_locs` properly by using its hash value in the `canonicalize` function. This ensures consistency in the block comparison and should resolve the bug.
