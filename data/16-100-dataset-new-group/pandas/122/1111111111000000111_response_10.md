The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that it wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is a known issue that has been reported on GitHub (GH28839). The problem occurs when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method and expecting it to return `False` when the block order is different.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to ensure that it accurately compares the blocks and their order. Specifically, we should update the comparison logic for the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to consider the block order and implement the correct comparison based on the requirement.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this updated `equals` function, the issue reported on GitHub (GH28839) will be resolved, and the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test provided earlier will pass.
