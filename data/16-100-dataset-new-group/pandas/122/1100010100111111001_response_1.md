To fix the buggy function, it is important to address the issue causing the failing test. The failing test is asserting that the method `equals` should return `False` when comparing two DataFrames with different values. An analysis of the failing test shows that the bug is related to comparisons within the `equals` method. The comparison of the DataFrames results in incorrect values, leading to the failing test.

To address this bug, the function should be modified to compare the actual values in the DataFrames rather than the object references, which is the cause of the failing test. This can be achieved by comparing the values of the DataFrames directly, ensuring that the values at each index are compared.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare the actual values of the blocks
    self_blocks = sorted([block.values for block in self.blocks])
    other_blocks = sorted([block.values for block in other.blocks])
    return all(
        (self_blocks[i] == other_blocks[i]).all() for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```
This corrected version of the function directly compares the values of the blocks in the DataFrames, ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual values rather than the object references. With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output values should be satisfied.
