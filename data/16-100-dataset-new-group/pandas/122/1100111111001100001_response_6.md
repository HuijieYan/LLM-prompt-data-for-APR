The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison of the `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The issue could be due to the sorting logic and block comparisons in the `equals` function.

The buggy function first checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are not equal, and then proceeds to check if each pair of axes are equal using their `equals` method. Next, it consolidates both `self` and `other` objects in place. Finally, it compares the blocks of the two objects after sorting them based on their datatype and `mgr_locs`.

However, there are a few potential errors within the function:
1. The `equals` method of the axes (`ax1.equals(ax2)`) is used without checking that both axes are of the same type.
2. The `_consolidate_inplace` method is called on both the `self` and `other` objects, which could potentially alter the internal state of the objects and affect the comparison.
3. The comparison of blocks is done after sorting them based on their datatype and `mgr_locs`, but the actual comparison logic might not be taking these factors into account.

To fix the bug, we can consider the following strategy:
1. Ensure that we are comparing axes of the same type before using the `equals` method.
2. Only call `_consolidate_inplace` if it is required for the comparison, and ensure that it does not alter the internal state of the objects in an unexpected way.
3. Reassess the block comparison logic to ensure that it is comparing the blocks accurately.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes):
        if type(ax1) != type(ax2) or not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    # Consolidate in place only if required for comparison
    if any(isinstance(block, CategoricalBlock) for block in self.blocks) or any(isinstance(block, CategoricalBlock) for block in other.blocks):
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Skip sorting if blocks lists have different types
    if type(self.blocks) != type(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not (self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i])):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we perform additional checks to ensure that the axes are of the same type before comparing them, consolidate in place only if required for comparison, and directly compare the blocks without sorting based on datatype and `mgr_locs`. This should address the potential issues and allow the function to pass the failing test.
