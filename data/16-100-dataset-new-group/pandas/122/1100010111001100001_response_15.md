The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return `False` when comparing two DataFrames that have the same data but are in a different order. This is because the function first checks if the axes are the same, but does not consider the order of the blocks within the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to consider the order of the blocks within the DataFrames when checking for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Check if the blocks are equal in the same order
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will correctly compare the DataFrames and return `True` if they have the same data, regardless of the order of the blocks within the DataFrames.
