The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two BlockManager objects, which represent the internal data structures of pandas dataframes. The function first compares the axes of the two BlockManagers, then consolidates them and compares the blocks to check for equality.

After analyzing the failing test and the runtime values of the input parameters and variables inside the function, it appears that the bug may be related to the block order canonicalization and sorting.

The cause of the bug may be that the block order is not being properly canonicalized, leading to incorrect comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we can revise the canonicalize function to use the block's type and data instead of just the datatype name. This will ensure that the blocks are properly sorted before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type and the data
    # to ensure correct sorting for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
