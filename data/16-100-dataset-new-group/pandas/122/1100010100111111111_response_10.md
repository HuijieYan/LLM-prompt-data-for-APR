The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that it sorts the blocks of the `self` and `other` objects differently, which leads to a false positive when checking for equality. This results in the function returning `True` incorrectly, as indicated by the failing test.

To fix the bug, the sorting of the blocks needs to be consistent between the `self` and `other` objects before comparing them for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I changed the `canonicalize` function to convert the `mgr_locs` to a tuple, ensuring that the sorting is consistent even for unconsolidated blocks. This should fix the issue and make the `equals` function return the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.
