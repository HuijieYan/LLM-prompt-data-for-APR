def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        pd.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

## Explanation

The bug in the original function is that it uses `block.equals(oblock)` to compare blocks, but this is incorrect. The correct method to compare blocks is to use `pd.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values)`. This is why the test fails. The corrected function uses `pd.array_equal` to compare the blocks, which will fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.

By using `pd.array_equal`, the corrected function correctly compares the values of the blocks to determine if they are equal, addressing the bug in the original function.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
