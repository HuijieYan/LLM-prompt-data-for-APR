Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the GitHub issue, the bug is caused by the canonicalization of block order using the `mgr_locs` attribute, which might result in identical blocks with different locations being mistakenly identified as equal. The bug is evident from the failing test case, which expects the function to return `False` for identical blocks with different locations, but the buggy function returns `True` instead.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization process should be revised to ensure that blocks with different locations are not considered equal. One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to incorporate the block locations as part of the canonicalization process so that blocks with different locations are not sorted as equal.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs as tuple)  # Use block locations as part of the canonicalization process

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the block locations into the canonicalization process, the corrected function ensures that blocks with different locations are correctly distinguished and not mistakenly identified as equal. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report as well.
