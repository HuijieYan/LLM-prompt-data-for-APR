The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is failing to correctly compare two dataframes, resulting in an incorrect return value of `True` in cases where the dataframes have identical blocks with different locations.

The issue in the `equals` function is with the comparison of the blocks of the two dataframes. The function incorrectly returns `True` when it should be returning `False` due to the different locations of identical blocks within the dataframes.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to modify the comparison logic to also consider the location of the blocks within the dataframes. This can be achieved by introducing a check for block location equality in addition to the existing block value comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
        if not (block.mgr_locs.as_array == oblock.mgr_locs.as_array).all():
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, after sorting the blocks, an additional check has been added to compare the block locations using `mgr_locs.as_array`. If the block values are equal but the locations are different, the function will correctly return `False`.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
