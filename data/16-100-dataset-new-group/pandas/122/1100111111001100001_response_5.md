The bug in the `equals` function appears to be related to the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. It seems that the `canonicalize` function is not properly comparing the blocks. Additionally, there is a nested `canonicalize` function defined twice in the buggy function and the class, which is unnecessary and confusing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function properly compares the blocks and remove the duplicate nested function definitions.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should address the issue and pass the failing test.
