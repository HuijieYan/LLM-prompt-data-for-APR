The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. The `equals` function is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. The specific issue here is that identical blocks with different locations incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when using the `equals` function.

The cause of the bug can be identified in the implementation of the `equals` function. It compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManagers` but fails to address the issue of identical blocks with different locations. This leads to incorrect results when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to properly address the issue of identical blocks with different locations when comparing `BlockManager` instances.

The corrected version of the `equals` function can directly compare the values of the dataframes instead of comparing the blocks. This can be done by accessing the underlying data of the dataframes and performing a direct comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def equals(self, other):
        # Directly compare the values of the dataframes
        return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

By comparing the values of the dataframes directly, the corrected `equals` function will properly handle the issue of identical blocks with different locations.

This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass. It will also address the issue reported in the GitHub post titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".
