The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is located in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, with the error message `assert True is False`.

Upon analyzing the input/output values and the types of the variables inside the buggy function, we find that the `equals` method is not correctly comparing the dataframes `df1` and `df2`. The `equals` method fails to identify that the order of the columns in the dataframes is different, leading to the incorrect assertion failure.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to take into account the order of the columns in the dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not set(self.columns) == set(other.columns):
        return False
    if any((self.dtypes != other.dtypes).any()):
        return False
    if not (self == other).all().all():
        return False
    return True
```

This corrected version compares the columns of the dataframes and their corresponding data types to ensure that the comparison is accurate. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` method function correctly.

With the corrected function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
