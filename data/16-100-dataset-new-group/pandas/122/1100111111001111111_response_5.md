The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of the blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, however, the `canonicalize` function is defined twice in the `BlockManager` class and is not properly used in the `equals` function.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function from the `BlockManager` class and ensure that the correct `canonicalize` function is used in the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Use the canonicalize function from the same file, but not the same class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the correct `canonicalize` function, the `equals` function should now operate as expected and pass the failing test.
