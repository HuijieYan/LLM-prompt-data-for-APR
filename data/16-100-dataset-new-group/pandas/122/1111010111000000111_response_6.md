From the provided information, the buggy function `equals` is causing the DataFrame.equals() method to return True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.

The potential errors within the buggy function are related to the comparison of blocks and their locations.

The cause of the bug can be explained by the nature of the `equals` function:
- The function compares DataFrame objects by their axes and block data to determine equality.
- The bug occurs when identical blocks have different locations, resulting in the function incorrectly returning True instead of False, as expected.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic should be adjusted to consider the equality of the blocks in the presence of different block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, sorted(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version addresses the bug by sorting the block locations before comparison, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly determined as equal. This corrected version should fix the bug and address the issue posted on GitHub.
