The issue is caused by the `equals` function returning `True` when it should return `False` due to identical blocks with different locations. 

The buggy function `equals` is comparing the `self_axes` and `other_axes`, consolidating them in place, and then sorting and comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to determine if they are equal. The issue arises because the block order is being canonicalized based on the block's data type name and manager locations, causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered equal.

To fix this bug, the canonicalization of blocks should not be tied to the location of the blocks. Instead, it should be based solely on the data type name to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on the data type name only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version removes the dependency on the block locations when canonicalizing the block order and instead only considers the data type name. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations will not be considered equal, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
