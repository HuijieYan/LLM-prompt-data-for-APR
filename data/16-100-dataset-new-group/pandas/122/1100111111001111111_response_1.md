To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the comparison of blocks within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The issue is related to the comparison of blocks with different locations but the same content.

The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. However, the comparison of blocks is still problematic because it doesn't handle cases where the blocks have the same content but different locations.

To fix this, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to use the block content as a sorting key, in addition to the type name and manager locations. This will ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are considered equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the content of the blocks along with their type name and manager locations. This ensures that blocks with the same content are considered equal, regardless of their location.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
