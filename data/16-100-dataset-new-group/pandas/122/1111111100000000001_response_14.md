The buggy function 'equals' within the 'BlockManager' class appears to be comparing two instances of the class and checking if they are equal. The function makes use of several other methods such as '_consolidate_inplace' and 'canonicalize' to perform the comparison.

The potential error locations within the function could be in the comparison logic where it checks the lengths of axes and blocks, as well as the sorting and comparison of the blocks.

The bug in the function could be caused by incorrect comparison logic or a problem with the sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we can revise the comparison logic and ensure that the sorting and comparison of the blocks is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the 'equals' function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I have added lambda functions to the sorting of blocks based on the type name and 'mgr_locs' to ensure the correct ordering. Then, I compare the sorted blocks to check for equality.
