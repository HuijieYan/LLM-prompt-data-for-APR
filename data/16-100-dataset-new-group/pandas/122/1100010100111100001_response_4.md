The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. However, the comparison logic is flawed, leading to a failing test with the error message `assert True is False`. The failing test is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it instead returns `True`.

The buggy function involves sorting the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects based on their type and location, and then comparing them for equality using the `equals` method. However, the sorting and comparison logic is not correctly handling the comparison of the two `BlockManager` objects.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the blocks are sorted and compared. The `canonicalize` function is used to determine the order of the blocks, but it may not be effectively distinguishing the blocks when they are sorted. This could result in incorrect comparisons and ultimately lead to the faulty return value.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic when sorting and comparing the blocks should be revised to ensure that the blocks are effectively distinguished and compared for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_slice()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple with the block's type name and `mgr_locs` as a tuple, effectively distinguishing the blocks. Additionally, the `equals` function on the blocks compares them based on their properties, ensuring a correct comparison and return value.
