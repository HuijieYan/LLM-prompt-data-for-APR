The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to wrongly return `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations, rather than returning `False` as expected. 

Upon analyzing the function, we can see that the issue arises from the comparison of blocks with different locations. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks in a specific order, but the comparison of these blocks does not consider different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function in a way that it also takes into account the locations of the blocks. This will ensure that the comparison considers the entire block's data in addition to its type and location.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the `mgr_locs` of the block in addition to the `dtype.name`. This modification ensures that the comparison considers the location of the blocks and will return the correct result.

With this modification, the `equals` function will now correctly determine whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal and should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
