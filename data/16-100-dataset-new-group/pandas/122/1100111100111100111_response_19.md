The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` incorrectly, even when the dataframes are not equal. The issue is related to identical blocks with different locations.

The bug seems to be due to the use of the `canonicalize` function, which is intended to sort and compare blocks. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not being accessed correctly within the `canonicalize` function, resulting in the incorrect comparison.

To fix this, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block. Additionally, the block comparison should be improved to handle cases where the blocks have the same content but are stored at different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now accesses the `mgr_locs` and `values` attributes of the block for sorting and comparison. This allows for a more accurate comparison of the blocks, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass, and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
