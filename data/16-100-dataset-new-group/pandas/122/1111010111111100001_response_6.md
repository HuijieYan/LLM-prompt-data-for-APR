The buggy function `equals` is attempting to compare two `BlockManager` instances to check for equality. The function is making use of a helper function `canonicalize` to sort and compare the individual blocks of the `BlockManager` instances. However, the issue seems to be arising from the comparison of the blocks.

After examining the runtime input/output values, it appears that the comparison of the blocks is failing due to the fact that the order of elements within the blocks is not the same between `self` and `other`. This is evidenced by the fact that the `block.mgr_locs` variable presents different values for `self` and `other`.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be modified to account for the different ordering of elements within the blocks of `self` and `other`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.shape, block.dtype, block.values.to_list()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.shape, block.dtype, block.values.to_list()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` helper function has been replaced with a lambda function in the sorting process, which now takes into account the shape, the data type, and the values of the blocks for comparison. This should ensure that the blocks are properly compared for equality, and the failing test should now pass.
