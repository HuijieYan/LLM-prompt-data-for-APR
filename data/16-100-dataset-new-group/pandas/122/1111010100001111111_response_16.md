The bug in the `equals` function is causing the function to incorrectly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. This is problematic because it leads to incorrect comparisons and can impact downstream calculations and operations involving the `BlockManager` class.

The cause of the bug lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function. The function is comparing the blocks using the `equals` method, but it does not account for the possible difference in block locations, leading to incorrect comparisons and resulting in an unexpected `True` return value.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic must be enhanced to consider block locations as well when comparing the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks using both type name and block locations
    return all(
        (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) ==
        (oblock.dtype.name, oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        and block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is used to create a tuple combining the type name and block locations. Then, this tuple is used in conjunction with the `equals` method to compare the blocks. This guarantees that both the type and the block locations are considered during the comparison, addressing the bug and ensuring that the `equals` function returns the correct result.

After applying this correction, the `equals` function will handle block comparisons correctly, and the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect return of `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations will be resolved.
