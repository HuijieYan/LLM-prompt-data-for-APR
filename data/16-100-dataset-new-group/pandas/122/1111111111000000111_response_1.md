### Bug analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is located within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is calling the `equals` function on two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`). The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function is wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Potential error locations:
The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of axes length.
2. Incorrect usage of the `_consolidate_inplace` function.
3. Sorting of self and other blocks using incorrect criteria.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `equals` function. It mistakenly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with the same data but different block locations.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the comparison of axes length to correctly evaluate the equality of DataFrames.
2. Use the `_consolidate_inplace` function appropriately to ensure proper comparison.
3. Adjust the criteria for sorting self and other blocks to ensure accurate comparison.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order based on type and mgr_locs to ensure accurate comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now return `False` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, therefore addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
