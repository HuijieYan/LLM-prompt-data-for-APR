## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The cause of the bug was the `canonicalize` function in the original code. It used `block.dtype.name` instead of just `block.dtypes` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` instead of just `block.mgr_locs`. By changing these two lines in the `canonicalize` function, we can correctly compare the blocks based on their types and locations.

By making these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the DataFrames and return `False` for the provided test case, as expected.
