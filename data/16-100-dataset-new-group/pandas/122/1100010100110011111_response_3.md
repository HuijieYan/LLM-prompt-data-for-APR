The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should be returning `False` for the given test case.
The issue is that the function is not properly comparing the two DataFrames and is returning incorrect results.

Upon analysis, the potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of `equals` is not properly handling the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. This is resulting in incorrect comparison results and causing the assertion to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames is done correctly. This can be achieved by properly implementing the logic to compare the blocks in a way that matches the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self._mgr.blocks
    other_blocks = other._mgr.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks.sort()
    other_blocks.sort()

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly compare the blocks within the DataFrames and return the expected results.

This corrected function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
