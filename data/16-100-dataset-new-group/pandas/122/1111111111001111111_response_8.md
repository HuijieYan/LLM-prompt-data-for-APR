Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from the comparison of blocks within the dataframes. The issue is incorrectly identifying identical blocks with different locations as equal. This causes the `equals` function to return True when it should return False, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `canonicalize` function and its usage in the `equals` function:

1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's index as a part of the representation.
2. Use the modified `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks in the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to include block index
    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), index)

    # sort blocks with index using modified canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted([(block, index) for index, block in enumerate(self.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, index) for index, block in enumerate(other.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, index), (oblock, other_index) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks) if index == other_index
    )
```

With the above correction, the `equals` function should now properly compare blocks with their index included, hence resolving the bug and passing the failing test case.
