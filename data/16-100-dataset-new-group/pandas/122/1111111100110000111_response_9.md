The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the comparison of the blocks and the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The function sorts the blocks based on their data type and location, but it may not handle certain types of blocks properly, leading to a false positive result in the equality comparison.

The bug is caused by the failure of the `equals` method to properly compare DataFrames when the blocks have identical data but different locations. This is due to the sorting mechanism of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which may not handle block types like Categorical properly, leading to the incorrect comparison result.

To fix the bug, you may need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle all types of blocks correctly when sorting. Additionally, you should ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into consideration the possibility of identical data with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, CategoricalBlock):
            return (block.__class__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.toarray().tobytes())
        else:
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.toarray().tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version handles the block sorting more intricately, especially for CategoricalBlock. It considers the values of the block as well to ensure a proper comparison, leading to a correct result for the `equals` method.
