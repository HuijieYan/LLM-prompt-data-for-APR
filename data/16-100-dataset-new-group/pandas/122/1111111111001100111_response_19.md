The bug in the equals function in the BlockManager class is causing the failing test. The issue is due to the comparison of blocks with different locations always returning True, even when the blocks are not equal.

The problem is primarily located in the equals function, specifically in the comparison of block locations. Additionally, the canonicalize function does not behave as expected, leading to incorrect comparisons of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to update the equals function to properly compare the blocks by their content, rather than their locations. The canonicalize function also needs to be modified to generate a more accurate representation of the block, allowing for correct comparisons.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass, and the issue on GitHub will be resolved.
