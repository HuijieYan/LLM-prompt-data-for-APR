The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class does not correctly compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The problem arises from the comparison of blocks in an incorrect order.

The buggy function attempts to compare two BlockManagers by sorting and comparing their blocks in order to check for equality. However, the blocks are not being properly canonicalized for comparison, leading to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the canonicalization of the blocks is not done in a way that accurately represents the content of the blocks. This leads to incorrect ordering and comparison of the blocks, resulting in the function erroneously returning `True` instead of `False` for non-matching DataFrames.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization of the blocks can be improved to accurately represent the content and order of the blocks for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `type(block).__name__` to capture the block type and sorting the blocks based on accurate information from `mgr_locs`, the comparison of the blocks will be correctly ordered and compared for equality. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result for non-matching DataFrames.
