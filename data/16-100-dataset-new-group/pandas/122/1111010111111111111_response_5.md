### Bug Explanation
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks in two `BlockManager` instances. This comparison is causing the failing test to return `True` instead of the expected `False`. The bug occurs because the function is not properly sorting and comparing the blocks in a consistent manner, which results in incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `equals` function needs to properly sort and compare the blocks in a consistent manner. Using a canonicalization process to sort and compare the blocks based on their type name and manager locations will ensure a consistent comparison and resolve the bug.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By using the `canonicalize` function to create consistent sorting key based on type name and manager locations, the corrected version of the `equals` function will provide a consistent and accurate comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. This fix will resolve the bug and ensure that the failing test returns the expected `False`.
