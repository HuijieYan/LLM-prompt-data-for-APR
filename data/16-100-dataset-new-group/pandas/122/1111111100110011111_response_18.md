### Correction

Based on the error message and the function provided, it seems that the bug is related to the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. The expected behavior is for the `equals` function to correctly compare the attributes of the two instances and return `False` if they are not equal, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The bug may be caused by how the function compares the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The sorting logic using the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent comparison seems to be incorrect.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `equals` function in a way that it correctly compares the blocks of the two instances and returns `False` if they are not equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the blocks before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare the blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this implementation, the `equals` function should correctly compare the blocks of the two instances and return `False` if they are not equal, addressing the issue in the failing test and the GitHub bug report.
