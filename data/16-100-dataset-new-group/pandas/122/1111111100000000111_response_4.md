The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class has an issue that causes it to return True in cases of identical blocks with different locations, instead of the expected False. This issue was reported on GitHub with a code sample and the expected output.

The root cause of this bug seems to be that the function `canonicalize` within the `equals` function is not correctly handling the order of blocks and is therefore returning True incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to correctly handle the order of blocks based on their type name and locations. Additionally, the comparison logic within the `equals` function should be updated to correctly handle the comparison of blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been modified to use the `type` of the block and its `mgr_locs` for ordering. The comparison logic has also been updated to correctly compare the blocks.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function returns the expected output.
