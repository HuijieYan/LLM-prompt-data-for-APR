The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function seems to have a problem with the order of the blocks, which causes the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be moved outside of the `equals` function and placed at the top level of the `BlockManager` class. This is because the `canonicalize` function is defined both at the class level and within the `equals` function, and this could be causing confusion within the function.

Additionally, the `canonicalize` function should take two arguments: `self` and `block`. This will allow the function to properly access the properties of the `BlockManager` class and the block being processed.

Finally, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should be based on the block's metadata, its location, and its data type. This will ensure that the comparison is based on reliable criteria.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # ... (other methods)

    # Move the canonicalize function outside of the equals function
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
       
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: self.canonicalize(self, block))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: other.canonicalize(other, block))

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By making these changes, the `canonicalize` function is correctly defined and used within the `equals` function to ensure that the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` follows the expected criteria. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
