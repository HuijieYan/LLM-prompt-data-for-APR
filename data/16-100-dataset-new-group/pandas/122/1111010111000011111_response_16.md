## Correction:

The issue seems to be related to the comparison of DataFrames using the `equals` method, which is returning `True` incorrectly in some cases.

Looking at the `equals` method, the potential error location seems to be in the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. It is likely that the sorting and comparing logic within the `canonicalize` function is causing the incorrect comparison result.

The root cause of the bug is the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals` method, leading to the method returning `True` when it should return `False`. This is evident from the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, which expects the comparison of two dataframes with different values to return `False`, but the current implementation returns `True`.

To fix the bug, we should revisit the logic used to compare the blocks within the `equals` method. One potential strategy to fix the bug could be to improve the sorting and comparison logic within the `canonicalize` function to ensure that the blocks are correctly compared.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the `equals` method, the `canonicalize` function now uses the block's dtypes and mgr_locs to create a tuple for comparison. This should ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly, addressing the bug and causing the failing test to pass.
