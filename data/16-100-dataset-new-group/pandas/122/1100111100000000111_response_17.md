Analysis:
- The GitHub issue reports that the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.
- The provided source code contains a function named `equals` within the `BlockManager` class, which is likely the source of the bug.
- The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances, and during the comparison, it canonicalizes the block order based on the type name and `mgr_locs`.
- The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside of the class and once within the class.
- The comparison logic in the `equals` function seems correct, but the bug might be related to how the blocks are sorted and compared.

Potential error location:
- The bug might be related to the logic of canonicalizing and comparing the blocks using the `sorted` function.

Cause of the bug:
- The bug seems to be occurring because the `canonicalize` function is defined twice - once outside of the class and once within the class. This ambiguity might be causing unexpected behavior when the function is called within the `equals` method.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- The first step to fix the bug is to remove the ambiguity by removing one of the definitions of the `canonicalize` function. Since the function is specific to the `BlockManager` class, it should be defined within the class scope.
- Additionally, the logic for canonicalizing and comparing the blocks should be reviewed, and any potential issues in the sorting and comparison process should be fixed.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The buggy function is corrected based on the provided analysis and strategy

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    # Corrected definition of the canonicalize function within the class scope
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # The corrected equals function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # Canonicalize block order using the class-specific canonicalize function
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By making these changes, the bug related to incorrect comparison of identical blocks with different locations should be resolved.
