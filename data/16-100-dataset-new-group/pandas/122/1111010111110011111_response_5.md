## Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to determine if they are equal. However, the function is not handling the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` correctly, leading to the incorrect output in certain cases.

The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different values for the same columns. It then uses the `equals` method to assert that the dataframes are not equal, which is expected to be true.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`. This suggests that the `equals` method is not correctly identifying the differences between the two dataframes.

The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem, where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which aligns with the observation from the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` method, we need to ensure that it correctly compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`. This involves iterating through the blocks in both instances and comparing them to identify any discrepancies.

Additionally, the comparison logic should consider the dtype and location of the blocks to handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by dtype and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` method sorts the blocks by dtype and location, using a canonicalization function. Then, it iterates through the sorted blocks to compare them. If any blocks are found to be unequal, the method returns `False`. If all blocks are equal, it returns `True`.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and ensure that the `equals` method correctly identifies the equality of `BlockManager` instances.
