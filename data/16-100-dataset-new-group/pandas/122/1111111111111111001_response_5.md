The bug in the equals function seems to be caused by incorrect block ordering when comparing two BlockManagers. The function attempts to sort the blocks using a canonicalize method that removes duplicates and orders this unique set. However, this canonicalize method is not properly implemented and is causing the failure of the test case.

To fix this, the canonicalize method should be reimplemented within the BlockManager class so that it works correctly with the blocks.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Reimplement the canonicalize block order method
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.max())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the equals method should now correctly compare two BlockManagers.
