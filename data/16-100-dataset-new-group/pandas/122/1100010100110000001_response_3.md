## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `equals` method is not working as expected. The test is failing because it is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return False, but instead, it is returning True.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison of blocks using the `equals` method may not be working correctly.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` may not be accurate.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by incorrect comparison of the blocks and the sorting of the blocks. This leads to the `equals` method returning True when it should return False.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method should be checked for accuracy. Additionally, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should be reviewed to ensure it's correctly ordering the blocks before comparison.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Comparison function for blocks
    def compare_blocks(block, oblock):
        return block.equals(oblock)

    # Sort the blocks
    canonicalize = lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a separate comparison function `compare_blocks` is defined to handle the comparison of blocks, and the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` has been revised to ensure the correct order before comparison.
