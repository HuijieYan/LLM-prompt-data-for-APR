The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return True incorrectly in case of identical blocks with different locations. The issue was reported on GitHub with the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The bug occurs when comparing two DataFrames using the `.equals()` method. It incorrectly returns True instead of False when the DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations. 

The root cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method fails to properly differentiate between identical blocks with different locations. This causes the comparison to incorrectly return True.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to properly consider block locations when determining block equality. Additionally, the comparison logic within the `equals` method should be updated to use the modified `canonicalize` function for accurate block comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should properly differentiate between identical blocks with different locations and return the correct result. This should address the issue reported on GitHub as well as fix the failing test case.
