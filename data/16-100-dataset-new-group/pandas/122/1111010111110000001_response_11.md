The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class, used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. The method returns `True` if the two instances are equal, which is determined by comparing their axes and blocks.

The issue in the buggy function is that it's not handling the comparison of different data types correctly. Specifically, it's not taking into account the fact that the data types for the columns in the `DataFrames` can be different, and the comparison is currently expecting the columns to be of the exact same data type and in the exact same order.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to check the equality of the column values based on the column labels, without necessarily comparing the exact data type or order.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # check equality of block values by column labels
    return all(
        self.blocks[column].equals(other.blocks[column]) for column in self_blocks.columns
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now handle the comparison of the two instances of `BlockManager` correctly, regardless of the data type or order of the columns. This should resolve the failing test.
