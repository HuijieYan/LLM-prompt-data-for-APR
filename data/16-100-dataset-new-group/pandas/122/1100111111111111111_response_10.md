The problem in the buggy function lies with the `canonicalize` function. It is defined twice, once inside the `BlockManager` class and once outside the class. However, when it is called inside the `equals` function, it is called without the class name, which causes Python to use the outer `canonicalize` function, not the one inside the `BlockManager` class.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `canonicalize` function called inside the `equals` method refers to the one inside the `BlockManager` class.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Make sure to refer to the canonicalize function inside the BlockManager class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By explicitly defining the `canonicalize` function to be within the BlockManager class, we ensure that the function is correctly invoked within the `equals` method. This will address the issue of returning incorrect results for comparing DataFrames as reported in the GitHub issue.
