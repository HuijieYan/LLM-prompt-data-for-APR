The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which is defined twice in the `BlockManager` class. This causes the function to potentially return `True` when comparing two blocks with the same data but different locations.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be removed from the `equals` function, and instead, the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks should be directly used for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these modifications, the `equals` function should now accurately compare the block data without being affected by the locations of the blocks. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub, ensuring that the function returns the expected output and resolves the bug.
