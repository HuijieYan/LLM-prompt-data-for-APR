## Correction:

The issue here is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the dataframes `df1` and `df2`, which should be False, but it's returning True. This is happening due to the implementation of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.

The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the blocks of the dataframes based on a sorting order, which involves ordering the blocks by their data type and location. This sorting is causing the comparison to incorrectly return True in cases where the block data is the same, but their order is different.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual data within the blocks, not just their order. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks_data = [b._try_coerce_args(b.values) for b in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [b._try_coerce_args(b.values) for b in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_data, oblock_data) for block_data, oblock_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

This version of the function directly compares the underlying block data, rather than relying on the order. With this change, the function should now correctly return False for the failing test case provided.

This change addresses the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensures that the `equals` function correctly compares the dataframes based on their content.
