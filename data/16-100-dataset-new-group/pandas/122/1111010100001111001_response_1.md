The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing their blocks. The function fails to return the correct result because of a bug in the comparison logic.

Specifically, the bug occurs in the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The function does not correctly handle the comparison of blocks and the sorting of blocks based on their type and locations.

To fix this bug, the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` needs to be modified. Additionally, the canonicalize function that sorts the blocks should be updated to correctly handle the dtype and mgr_locs attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now correctly compares the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs attributes, ensuring that the comparison logic is accurate and returns the expected result.
