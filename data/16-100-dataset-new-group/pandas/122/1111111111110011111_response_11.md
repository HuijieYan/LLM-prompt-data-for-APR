The issue lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, specifically in the block canonicalization logic. The buggy version of the function is returning incorrect results due to an issue in sorting and comparing the blocks. This results in the failing test case where two DataFrames that are not equal are being incorrectly evaluated as equal by the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the canonicalization logic for comparing blocks and ensure that the comparison is done accurately according to the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the canonicalization of blocks is modified to use the string representations of the block's dtype and mgr_locs. This ensures that the comparison is done accurately according to the block's type and location, addressing the issue with the original function.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
