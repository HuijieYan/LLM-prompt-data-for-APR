The buggy function `equals` is a method defined within the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas` library. It is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The function is failing to correctly determine the equality of dataframes when they have identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:

1. The comparison of the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
2. The sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function.
3. The conditional statements that return `False` if the lengths are not equal or if the blocks are not equal.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is incorrectly handling the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. This results in the function improperly returning `True` when it should be `False`, as shown by the failing test case. The GitHub issue further confirms this bug.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `equals` function to ensure that it correctly compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version uses a more reliable method of sorting the blocks for comparison, and also correctly avoids the bug by comparing the blocks based on their values.

With this corrected version, the failing test case should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
