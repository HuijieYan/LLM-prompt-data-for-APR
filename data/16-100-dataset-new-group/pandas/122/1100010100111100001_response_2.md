The buggy function `equals` is not working correctly and is failing the test. The failing test is trying to compare two dataframes `df1` and `df2`, and expects the result of `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`. However, the test is failing with the error message `assert True is False`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of the values from the input dataframes `df1` and `df2`.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks, which may not yield the correct result.

The cause of the bug is that the function `equals` is not correctly handling the comparison of the two dataframes. It is also sorting the blocks which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the two dataframes is accurate and that the blocks are compared correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare the blocks directly
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the sorting of the blocks and directly compare the blocks from `self` and `other`. This should ensure the correct comparison of the dataframes and pass the failing test.
