The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two DataFrames, which is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The error message `E       assert True is False` indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` in the test case is failing. It is comparing the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, and it's expecting them to not be equal.

The cause of the bug is that the `BlockManager.equals` function is not correctly implementing the comparison between the blocks of the two DataFrames. It is not properly handling the comparison of the values within the blocks.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `BlockManager.equals` function to compare the values within the blocks of the two DataFrames while properly handling their order and types.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [self.blocks.get(k) for k in sorted(self.blocks)]
    other_blocks = [other.blocks.get(k) for k in sorted(other.blocks)]
    
    return all(
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function now compares the values within the blocks using `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal` to ensure that the corresponding blocks in the two DataFrames are equal.

With this corrected function, the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any assertion errors.
