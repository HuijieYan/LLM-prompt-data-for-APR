The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class fails when comparing two dataframes because when the blocks within the dataframes are identical, but their locations are different, it returns `True`, incorrectly indicating that the dataframes are equal.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the location of blocks within the dataframes along with their data types when sorting the blocks. This way, the comparison will accurately reflect the equality of dataframes irrespective of the location of their blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the location of the blocks within the dataframes in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version ensures that the equality comparison considers the block locations, thus addressing the issue reported in GitHub and making the function return the expected output when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.
