The bug in the `equals` function stems from the fact that it sorts blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`. This results in `df1.equals(df2)` returning True, even when the column order is different, leading to an incorrect comparison.

To fix this bug, the sorting of blocks needs to be modified to ensure that the comparison is accurate. We can create a list of tuples containing the dtype name, mgr_locs, and the position of the block. Then, sort the blocks based on this list to ensure that the comparison is based on the actual content and structure of the data frames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block, idx):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs, idx)

    self_blocks = [canonicalize(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)]
    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

    other_blocks = [canonicalize(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(other.blocks)]
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the comparison will now correctly account for differences in the data frames, including different column orders, and return the expected result.
