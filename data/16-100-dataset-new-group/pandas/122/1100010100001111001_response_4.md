The cause of the bug seems to be related to the canonicalization of the block order within the `equals` function. The function is supposed to sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which includes `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. However, it seems that the sorting might not be consistent with the input, resulting in incorrect comparisons and subsequent false returns.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalization process consistently compares the blocks in a way that accurately reflects their equality. This may involve updating the `canonicalize` function or changing the sorting process.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use `str(block.dtype)` instead of `block.dtype.name` to consistently include the type of the block in the canonicalization process. This should help ensure that the sorting process is more reliable and that the comparisons accurately reflect the equality of the blocks.
