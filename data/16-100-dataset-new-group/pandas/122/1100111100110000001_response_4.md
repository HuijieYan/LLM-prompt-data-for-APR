The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file is not comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` correctly, leading to the failing test with the error message:

```
E       assert True is False
E        +  where True = <bound method NDFrame.equals of    a  b\n0  1  s\n1  2  d>(   a  b\n0  s  1\n1  d  2)
E        +    where <bound method NDFrame.equals of    a  b\n0  1  s\n1  2  d> =    a  b\n0  1  s\n1  2  d.equals
```

The buggy function does not correctly compare the DataFrames by their content and does not handle the data type differences. To fix this, the function needs to be modified to handle the differences in types and values more accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the axes
    if self._get_axes() != other._get_axes():
        return False
    
    # Compare each block
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In this corrected version, the function first compares the axes of the two objects. If the axes are not equal, the function returns `False`. Then, the function iterates through each block and compares them using the `equals()` function of each block. If any block is not equal, the function returns `False`. If all comparisons are successful, the function returns `True`.

By using this corrected version of the function, the failing test should pass.
