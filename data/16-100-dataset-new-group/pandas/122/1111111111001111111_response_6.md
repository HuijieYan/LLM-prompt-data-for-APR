The bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class is causing the test_dataframe_not_equal() test to fail. The issue posted on GitHub indicates that the equals() method wrongly returns True when the blocks have different locations, which is not the expected behavior.

The buggy function performs a comparison of two BlockManager instances. It checks if the lengths of their axes are equal, and if their axes are equal. Then, it consolidates the blocks in both instances before comparing the number and order of the blocks. However, the bug occurs in the comparison of the blocks, where it wrongly returns True even when the blocks have different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account their actual contents and not just their order. We can achieve this by comparing the data within the blocks rather than just the block objects themselves.

Here's the corrected version of the equals() method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating through each block and comparing their contents using the equals() method, we ensure that the comparison takes into account the actual data within the blocks. This should correctly resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
