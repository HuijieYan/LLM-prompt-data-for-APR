## Correction

The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly comparing the two DataFrames due to the ordering of the blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to order the blocks based on their `dtype` name and `mgr_locs`, but the ordering is not considering the content of the blocks. This results in the `equals` function returning `True` when it should actually return `False`.

To fix this issue, the `canonicalize` function should compare the content of the blocks to ensure a proper comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    sorted_self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())
    sorted_other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(sorted_self_blocks, sorted_other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on their values, ensuring that the comparison considers both the `dtype` and the content of the blocks.

After making this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass.
