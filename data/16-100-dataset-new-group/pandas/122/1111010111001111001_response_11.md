The bug in the equals function arises because it does not correctly compare the blocks of two BlockManager objects. This leads to incorrect results when comparing two DataFrames and causes the test_dataframe_not_equal test to fail.

To fix this bug, the equals function needs to compare not only the axes of the BlockManager objects but also their blocks. The comparison of blocks should consider both the dtype and the mgr_locs of each block.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return str((block.dtype, block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the equals function should now properly compare the blocks of the two BlockManager objects and yield correct results when comparing two DataFrames.
