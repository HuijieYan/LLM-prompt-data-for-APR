The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class from the pandas library. It compares two BlockManager objects to check if they are equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function checks the length of the axes of self and other, but it does not handle the case where the axes are None, which can cause an error.
2. The function sorts the blocks of self and other based on their type name and manager locations, but it does not handle the case where the blocks are None, which can cause an error.
3. It compares the equality of the blocks using the `equals` method, but it does not handle the case where the blocks are None, which can cause an error.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not handle cases where the axes and blocks are None, which leads to potential errors when comparing the BlockManager objects.

To fix the bug, we can add checks to handle cases where the axes and blocks are None before performing comparisons.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.axes is None or other.axes is None:
        return False
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if self.blocks is None or other.blocks is None:
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs) if block.mgr_locs is not None else '')
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) if block is not None and oblock is not None else False
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added checks to handle cases where the axes and blocks are None before performing comparisons. We also modified the `canonicalize` function to handle None values in block manager locations. With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test.
