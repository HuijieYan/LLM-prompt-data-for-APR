Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, the problem arises when using the `equals` method for DataFrames. The issue is specifically related to identical blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect return value of True instead of the expected False.

The problem can be caused by the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks. Although the blocks may contain the same data, their order or location might differ.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization process needs to consider the order or the location of the blocks in a different way to properly distinguish between unconsolidated blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.data.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the data content itself rather than just the type name. This makes the process of sorting blocks more comprehensive, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are properly distinguished.
