## Correction:

The buggy function `equals` has an issue where it returns `True` instead of `False` in the test case provided. The problem seems to be related to the comparison of block locations. To fix this issue, the comparison of block locations should be modified to ensure that the equality comparison considers the locations as well.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include block's mgr_locs while canonicalizing it
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The key change in the corrected version is the modification of the `canonicalize` function to include the block's `mgr_locs` while canonicalizing it. This ensures that the comparison of blocks considers their locations as well, addressing the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

After making this change, the `equals` function should now return the correct result for the failing test case and similar scenarios.

This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the `equals` function behaves as expected for DataFrame comparisons.
