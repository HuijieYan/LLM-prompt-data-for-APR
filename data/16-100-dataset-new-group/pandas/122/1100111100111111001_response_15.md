The issue in the buggy function seems to be that the comparison of the blocks is not consistent with the input DataFrames, resulting in an incorrect equality check. The comparison logic should be adjusted to properly account for the data in the DataFrames.

To fix this, we should modify the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks within the DataFrames. Specifically, the sorting and comparison of the blocks needs to be adjusted to ensure a correct comparison. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on the dtype and block values for consistent comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.to_list()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.to_list()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test case and correctly compare the DataFrames based on their block components.
