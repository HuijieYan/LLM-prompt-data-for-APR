Based on the information provided about the bug and the runtime and expected values, it appears that the issue is related to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. The buggy function 'equals' incorrectly returns True in this case. The main identified potential error location within the function is the comparison of the sorted 'self.blocks' and 'other.blocks' without taking into account the different block locations.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle cases where identical blocks have different locations properly. This leads to the incorrect comparison of the two BlockManagers and results in a False positive.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the 'equals' function to consider the block locations when comparing the 'self.blocks' and 'other.blocks'. This can be achieved by modifying the 'canonicalize' function to include the block's location as well, and then sorting the blocks based on the updated canonicalization. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account the different block locations.

Below is the corrected version of the 'equals' function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and block values to include block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks taking into account the block locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block values and their locations in the canonicalization and sorting process, the corrected function will properly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
