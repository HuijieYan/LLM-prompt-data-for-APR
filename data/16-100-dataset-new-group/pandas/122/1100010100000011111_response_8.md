To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to address the issue described in the GitHub bug report. The problem occurs when the `equals()` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. We will need to modify the function to handle this specific scenario and ensure that it returns the correct boolean value as described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) 
        and np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added an additional check within the `all` statement to compare the values of the blocks using `np.array_equal()`. This change ensures that the blocks with identical values but different locations are correctly identified and the function returns the expected boolean value.

With the corrected function, the issue described in the GitHub bug report should be resolved, and the function should return the expected boolean value for the test cases provided.
