## Analysis and Bug Explanation

The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is called to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. However, due to a bug, the function returns an incorrect result when the blocks in the two instances have the same data but different locations.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` demonstrates this issue. It creates two DataFrame instances `df1` and `df2` with identical data but different locations and then asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, which currently fails due to the bug.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" also describes the same problem and provides a simple code sample as well as the expected output.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the logic for comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The current implementation fails to return the expected result when blocks have the same data but different locations.

One strategy to fix the bug is to compare the data within the blocks themselves rather than comparing the block behavior. This can be achieved by iterating over the blocks in both `BlockManager` instances and comparing the actual data within the blocks, regardless of their locations.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_data = [block.get_values() for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block.get_values() for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_data, oblock_data) for block_data, oblock_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the function compares the data within the blocks using `np.array_equal`. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations. With this fix, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
