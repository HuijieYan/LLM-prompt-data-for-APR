To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between `self` and `other` is performed correctly. Looking at the failing test case, we can see that the comparison of the data in `df1` and `df2` should return `False`, but it currently returns `True`.

The bug in the function occurs when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function should be defined outside of the `equals` function, as it is currently redefined inside the `equals` function. This leads to unexpected behavior when trying to sort the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function with the `canonicalize` function defined outside of the `equals` function:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions remain the same)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function is properly defined outside of the `equals` function and can be used for sorting the blocks to facilitate correct comparison. This should ensure that the `equals` function now returns the expected results for the failing test case.
