The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The comparison is not taking into account block locations, resulting in incorrect return values.

To fix this bug, the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists should take into consideration the locations of the blocks. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks using a tuple that combines the type name and the `mgr_locs` of the block.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function returns a tuple combining the type name (converted to string using `str()`) and the `mgr_locs` of the block. The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are then sorted using this canonicalization key, ensuring consistent comparison of blocks based on type and location.

This fix will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares blocks with different locations.
