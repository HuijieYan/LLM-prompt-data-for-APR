The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects, `self` and `other`, to determine if they are equal. It compares the axes' lengths, the blocks' lengths, and then attempts to canonicalize and compare the blocks themselves. It seems that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks as required by the test function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is comparing the blocks in a non-consistent order, leading to the incorrect determination of whether the `BlockManager` objects are equal.

To fix the bug, the sort order of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` while canonicalizing them should be consistent, ensuring that blocks are sorted in the same way for both `self` and `other` objects.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks consistently using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.iter_canonical_items()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
