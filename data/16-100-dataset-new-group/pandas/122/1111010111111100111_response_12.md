## Explanation of the Bug

The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. However, it has a bug that causes it to return `True` in cases where it should return `False`. This bug is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail with the error `assert True is False`.

The root cause of the bug lies in how the function compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. It first checks if the axes have the same length, which is a correct initial step. Then, it checks if the blocks themselves are equal, but the comparison is performed in a way that does not properly account for potential differences in the order or locations of the blocks.

Since the failing test is specifically aimed at DataFrame comparison, the issue on GitHub highlights that the `equals` function is returning the incorrect result when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the comparison must be enhanced to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than their ordered appearance. A better approach would involve sorting the blocks based on a criterion that considers the content of the blocks, and then comparing them in a way that accounts for any differences in the block locations.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort the blocks based on the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function addresses the issue by sorting the blocks based on a comparison criterion (`canonicalize`) that considers the type name and the manager locations. This ensures that even if the blocks are in different locations, they are compared based on their actual content.
