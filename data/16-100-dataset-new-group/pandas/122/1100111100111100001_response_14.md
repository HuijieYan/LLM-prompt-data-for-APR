The buggy function is the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, which compares two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The issue seems to be related to incorrect comparison, resulting in a failing assertion.

The potential error location is in the final return statement of the `equals` method, where it compares the sorted blocks from `self` and `other` instances and their equality.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function for defining block order is not implemented correctly. As a result, the blocks are not ordered correctly for comparison, leading to a false assertion.

To fix the bug, we should revise the `canonicalize` function to properly define the order for comparison of blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other methods...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `def canonicalize` function is updated to correctly define the block order for comparison. The `canonicalize` function now uses the `type` of the block and its `mgr_locs` slice to order the blocks. This should ensure the correct comparison of blocks and fix the failing test.
