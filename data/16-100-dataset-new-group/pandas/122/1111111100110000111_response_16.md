The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is causing the DataFrame equals() method to wrongly return True in cases of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in GitHub issue #28839. This is due to the failure of the equality comparison, leading to the unexpected output mentioned in the error message.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the sections where it compares the blocks and sorts them using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` does not consider identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect output when invoked by the `equals` method for DataFrame objects.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in addition to the dtype name for proper distinction. Then, we should update the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to ensure the comparison considers both dtype name and block locations.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_i8.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should return the expected output, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
