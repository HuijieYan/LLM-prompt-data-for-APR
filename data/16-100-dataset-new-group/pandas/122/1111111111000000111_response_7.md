## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing to correctly compare the equality of two DataFrames. The issue arises from the way it's comparing the blocks within the DataFrames, resulting in incorrect comparison results.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` calls the `equals` function with two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` having different values. The expected outcome is `False` since the DataFrames are not equal, but the buggy function returns `True` instead.

The GitHub issue further confirms the buggy behavior reported by the user, who expects the comparison of the DataFrames to return `False` but receives `True` instead.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the buggy `equals` function not correctly handling the comparison of different blocks within the DataFrames. Specifically, the issue arises from how the function is comparing the individual blocks and their order, leading to incorrect comparison results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be updated to properly compare the blocks within the DataFrames. This involves ensuring that the comparison is done accurately and takes into account the specific content and order of the blocks to determine the equality of the DataFrames.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the shape and axes
    if self.shape != other.shape or self.axes != other.axes:
        return False
    
    # Ensure that the blocks are consolidated
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare the blocks individually
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With the corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison of the DataFrames will accurately determine their equality and resolve the issue reported on GitHub. The function now correctly compares the shape, axes, and blocks of the DataFrames, ensuring that the comparison produces the expected outcome.
