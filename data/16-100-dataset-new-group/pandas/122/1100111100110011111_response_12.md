The issue with the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is that it fails to return the expected values when comparing DataFrames. Specifically, it returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The implementation of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function.
2. The comparison logic within the `equals` function for blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function does not cater to cases where blocks have identical data type names but different locations. This leads to incorrect comparison results when sorting the blocks in the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type names and the block locations for generating a unique identifier for each block. Additionally, the comparison logic for the sorted blocks needs to be updated to correctly compare them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then locations to distinguish unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the `equals` function should return the expected values for comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

This fix should resolve the issue posted on GitHub titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".
