### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations in the `equals` function include the comparison of blocks and the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks and the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is due to the bug in the comparison logic of the `equals` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` is done correctly. Additionally, the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function should be modified to produce the correct order for comparison.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Ensure that blocks are in the same order for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._is_single_block, block._mgr_loc))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._is_single_block, block._mgr_loc))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function includes modifying the sorting of blocks to ensure that they are sorted based on whether they are single blocks and their location. This will ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly and the `equals` function returns the expected result.
