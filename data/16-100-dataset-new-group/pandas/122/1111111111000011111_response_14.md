## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    """
    Core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
    ... (rest of the class documentation remains unchanged)
    """

    # ... (other methods remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        # Consolidate self and other in place before comparison
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        # Compare the number of blocks
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Canonicalize block order using the block's shape and values
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.shape, block.values))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.shape, block.values))
        
        # Perform element-wise comparison of each block
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if not block.equals(oblock):
                return False
        
        return True
```

The bug in the original function was that it failed to consolidate the internal data structures `self` and `other` before comparing them, which led to incorrect comparison results. The corrected function now consolidates `self` and `other` in place before comparison. It also sorts the blocks based on their shape and values and then performs element-wise comparison of each block to ensure a correct result.

With these corrections, the function should now produce the expected output for the failing test.

By using the corrected function, the failing test should now pass.

I would recommend testing this corrected function with a variety of different input DataFrames to ensure that it produces correct results in all cases. Additionally, it would be beneficial to run the test suite for `pandas` to ensure that the corrected function does not cause any regressions in other parts of the codebase.
