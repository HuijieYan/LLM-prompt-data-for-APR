The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function of the DataFrame in pandas incorrectly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. 

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the comparison of blocks is done using a unique identifier so that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the value and dtype
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the `block.values` and `block.dtype` as the unique identifier for sorting the blocks. This will prevent identical blocks with different locations from incorrectly being considered equal.
