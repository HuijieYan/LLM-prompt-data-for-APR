The bug in the `equals` method is likely due to the incorrect comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes`, causing the assertion to fail. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. This could lead to incorrect comparison between the blocks.

To fix the bug, the comparisons between `self_axes` and `other_axes` should be revised. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function should be properly implemented to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now pass the failing test and return the expected output based on the provided error message and input/output values.
