The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is not the expected behavior and is causing the test case to fail as reported in the GitHub issue. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, where the sorting and comparison logic may not be correctly identifying the identical blocks with different locations. Additionally, the canonicalization logic for sorting may also be affected.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the sorting and comparison logic for the blocks. The `equals` function should compare relevant block components while accounting for potential differences in locations.

To fix the bug, a strategy would involve modifying the comparison logic to ensure that equivalent blocks are correctly identified, even if they have different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `block.values` for comparison, and `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted using the updated `canonicalize` function. This should properly compare and identify equivalent blocks, even if they have different locations.
