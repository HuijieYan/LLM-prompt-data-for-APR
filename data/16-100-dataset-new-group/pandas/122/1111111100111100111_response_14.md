The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `assert df1.equals(df2) is False`. The issue described on GitHub also aligns with this bug.

It seems that the bug could be related to the comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes`, the consolidation of the blocks, and the sorting of the blocks. Specifically, the issue might be caused by incorrect comparison of the axes, improper consolidation of the blocks, and/or inaccurate sorting of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` needs to be revised, and the consolidation and sorting of the blocks should be performed accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` has been kept untouched as it appears to be functioning correctly. The consolidation of the blocks (`self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()`) is now performed accurately. Additionally, the sorting of the blocks within the `canonicalize` function, using the type name and `mgr_locs`, ensures that the blocks are sorted properly.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
