The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations. This bug is identified through the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file, which is raising an `AssertionError`.

The bug appears to be related to the way in which the function `canonicalize` is sorting the blocks. This sorting is causing the function to incorrectly identify identical blocks with different locations as equal, leading to the incorrect `True` return value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function so that it takes into account the unique locations of the blocks. This will involve incorporating the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks into the tuple that is used for sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the mgr_locs to account for unique block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly identify DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations as not equal, satisfying the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
