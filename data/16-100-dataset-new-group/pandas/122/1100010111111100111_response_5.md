The bug in the `equals` function seems to be causing incorrect comparison results for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This leads to the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` failing, as it expects the `equals` function to return `False` for two DataFrames with different block locations, but the function returns `True` instead, leading to an assertion error.

The potential error in the `equals` function lies in how it compares the blocks of the two DataFrames. It sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function and then checks if each pair of blocks are equal, but it does not account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations, causing incorrect comparison results.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not consider the block locations when generating the tuple for comparison.

To fix the bug, a new sorting key should be used that incorporates both the data type and the block locations to ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are not falsely considered equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Sort the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should correctly identify DataFrames with different block locations as not equal, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
