#### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` statement is returning `True` instead of `False` when it should be returning `False`.

#### Potential error locations:
1. The `canonicalize` function that is used to sort and compare the blocks.
2. Comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

#### Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is due to the comparison of sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. It seems that the sorting process in `canonicalize` is causing the comparison to return `True` instead of `False` when it should not.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The strategy for fixing the bug involves identifying a different approach to compare the blocks in the `self` and `other` objects. Also, the sorting process in the `canonicalize` function should be reviewed and modified if necessary to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not treated as equal.

#### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # improvement: directly compare the blocks without sorting
    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other.blocks) for block in self.blocks
    )
```
With this corrected version, the comparison directly checks if each block in `self.blocks` equals any block in `other.blocks`, ensuring that blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.
