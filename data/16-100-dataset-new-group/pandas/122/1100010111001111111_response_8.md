### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing the two `BlockManager` objects representing DataFrames. It incorrectly compares the dtype and mgr_locs, leading to unexpected results. This is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return True even when the two DataFrames are not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by updating the `equals` function to compare the contents of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects and confirm them to be equal. Additionally, the comparison should consider the column types and value locations to determine equality between DataFrames.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare block contents and column types for equality
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
        if block.dtype != oblock.dtype:
            return False
        if block.mgr_locs != oblock.mgr_locs:
            return False
    return True
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function explicitly compares the block contents, column types, and value locations within the `BlockManager` objects to determine equality, addressing the bug identified.
