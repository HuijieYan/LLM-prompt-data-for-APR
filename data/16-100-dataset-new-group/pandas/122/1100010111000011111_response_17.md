The bug in the provided `equals` function is that it is incorrectly comparing dataframes and returning True when the blocks have identical data but are located at different positions. The function is comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and returning True if the blocks have the same data, even if they are located at different positions.

To fix this bug, the function should not only compare the block data, but also consider the locations of the blocks. One approach to fix this bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block position in the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and data because the blocks might be identical
    # but located at different positions
    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted([(self.blocks[i], i) for i in range(len(self.blocks))], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(other.blocks[i], i) for i in range(len(other.blocks))], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    return all(
        block[0].equals(oblock[0]) and block[1] == oblock[1] 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function takes into account the block positions in addition to their data when comparing the dataframes. This ensures that the function correctly returns `False` for identical blocks located at different positions.

This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
