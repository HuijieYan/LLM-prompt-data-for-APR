## Analysis
The `equals` function in the `managers.py` file of `pandas` library seems to be incorrectly comparing the dataframes. From the failing test, it is clear that when comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2`, the `equals` function is wrongly returning `True` instead of `False`. The error message also indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing.

## Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison logic in the `equals` function, which is a part of the `DataFrame` class. This issue was reported on GitHub where it was mentioned that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by implementing a correct logic for comparing the two dataframes. The current comparison logic is not handling the case when the values are identical but the locations are different. The correct comparison should consider both the values and the locations when comparing the dataframes.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the bug-fixed file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    # compare the indexes first
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False

    # compare the blocks, considering both values and locations
    return all(
        (self.blocks[i] == other.blocks[i]).all() 
        and self.blocks[i].index.equals(other.blocks[i].index)
        for i in range(len(self.blocks))
    )
```

With the corrected `equals` function, the comparison now checks both the values and the locations of the blocks, ensuring a correct comparison of the dataframes. This should resolve the reported issue.
