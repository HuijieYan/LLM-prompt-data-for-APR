The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to produce the AssertionError. The issue reported on GitHub with the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" reflects this bug as well.

The cause of the bug is related to the comparison of blocks within the `equals` method, where the comparison is not distinguishing blocks with identical content in different locations. This leads to unexpected behavior, causing the failing test to produce the AssertionError. Additionally, the issue reported on GitHub also provides details about the test case and the expected output.

To fix this bug, the `equals` method should be modified to properly compare the blocks based on their content rather than just their location.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on their content
    def block_content_equal(block, oblock):
        return block.values.equals(oblock.values)

    return all(
        block_content_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should properly compare the content of the blocks and pass the failing test case, satisfying the expected output and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
