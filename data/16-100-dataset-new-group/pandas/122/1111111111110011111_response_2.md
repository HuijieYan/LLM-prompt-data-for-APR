To fix the bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, we need to update the sorting mechanism for the blocks and compare their elements correctly.

The bug occurs because the function `equals` incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is due to the incorrect comparison of blocks and the sorting mechanism used.

To fix this bug, we need to:
1. Modify the sorting mechanism for the blocks to include the block's location in the comparison.
2. Compare the blocks' elements correctly to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False

        for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
            if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
                return False

        return True
```

With these changes, the `equals` method will now correctly compare the blocks of the two DataFrames, taking into account their location and ensuring that the comparison is accurate.

By implementing these adjustments, the corrected `equals` method should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case, producing the expected output.
