The bug in the `equals` function is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the `BlockManager` class and once outside the class. This causes the second `canonicalize` function to overwrite the first one when it's called within the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the duplicate `canonicalize` function from the `BlockManager` class and ensure that the `canonicalize` function within the same class is being called when needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making sure that the correct `canonicalize` function is being called within the `equals` function, the bug should be fixed and the failing test case should pass.
