The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to how it handles the comparison of DataFrame blocks. The code attempts to sort the blocks based on their type and manager locations and then compare them for equality. However, the `canonicalize` function is not being called correctly within the `equals` function, which is likely causing the incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function is being called correctly and returns the expected values based on the input block.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.__repr__)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `canonicalize` function is called for each block and returns the expected values, which are then used for sorting and comparison. This should address the bug and make the `equals` function pass the failing test.
