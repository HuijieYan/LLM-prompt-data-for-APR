## Correction:

The issue seems to be related to comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, which is returning an unexpected result. The bug is likely caused by the way the `canonicalize` function is being used to order the blocks before comparison.

To fix this issue, one potential strategy could be to replace the `canonicalize` function with a new approach to ordering the blocks for comparison.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # New approach to ordering blocks for comparison
        self_blocks = [(block.shape, block.values) for block in self.blocks]
        other_blocks = [(block.shape, block.values) for block in other.blocks]
        
        return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This new approach creates a list of tuples for each block containing the shape and values of the block. Then, it compares these lists directly to determine if the DataFrames are equal.

By using this new approach, the `equals` method should now return the expected output and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
