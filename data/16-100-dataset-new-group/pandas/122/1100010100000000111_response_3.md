The bug in the equals function seems to be causing the DataFrame.equals() method to return True even when the blocks are identical but with different locations. This is evident from the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations," where a user expects the equals() method to return False for two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The cause of the bug seems to be in the canonicalize function, where blocks are being sorted using a combination of block type name and manager locations. This causes the equals method to return True even when the blocks are identical but with different locations.

To fix this bug, a strategy can be to modify the canonicalize function to only consider the block type name for sorting, removing the consideration for manager locations. This will ensure that the equals method correctly identifies DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations as not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using block type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the equals method should now return the expected False for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
