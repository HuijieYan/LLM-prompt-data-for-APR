Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:

The bug in the original function causes the `DataFrame.equals()` method to wrongly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug in the original function is in the `canonicalize` function. The original function sorts the blocks using the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, but this can cause unconsolidated blocks (like Categorical) with the same content to be sorted differently, leading to a wrong result in the comparison.

To fix the bug, the sorting of blocks should be based on `dtypes` and `mgr_locs` directly rather than `dtype.name`.

The corrected version of the function addresses this issue by using `block.dtypes` and `block.mgr_locs` for sorting the blocks, eliminating the potential problem of unconsolidated blocks being sorted differently.

This corrected version of the function will address the bug described in the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass.
