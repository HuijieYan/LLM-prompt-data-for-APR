The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test. The `equals` function is comparing two BlockManager instances, `self` and `other`, to check if they are equal. The bug likely arises from a comparison of the `blocks` attribute of `self` and `other`. The code sorts the blocks of `self` and `other` based on a key function `canonicalize` and then compares each block in sorted order. However, the sorting logic used in the `canonicalize` function could be causing the issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates a stable key for identifying the blocks. Additionally, the comparison logic should be revised to handle the comparison accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a stable key for sorting blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on a stable key generated by the `canonicalize` function, and accurate comparison logic is applied. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
