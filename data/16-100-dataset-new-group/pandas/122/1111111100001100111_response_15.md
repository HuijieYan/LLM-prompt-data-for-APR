The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is leading to failed tests and the expected output is not being returned.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the blocks in a standardized order. The blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are being sorted using a `canonicalize` function that is based on block dtype and locations. However, the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function does not return a standardized order, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to use block locations in a standardized format for comparison. We can achieve this by sorting the block locations using `block.mgr_locs.as_array` directly, without converting it to a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using `tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array)` in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the block locations are sorted and compared in a standardized format, resolving the bug.
