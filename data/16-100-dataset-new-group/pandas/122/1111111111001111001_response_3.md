The buggy function `equals` appears to be failing when trying to compare two BlockManager instances. The issue may lie in the comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager instances.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the problem may stem from the sorting and comparison of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. We can address this issue by sorting the blocks and comparing them directly, without the need for `canonicalize`.

A potential fix for the bug in the `equals` function can be to sort and compare the blocks directly, and then check if all comparisons are True, returning the appropriate result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate blocks before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks to enable direct comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The above corrected function should resolve the comparison issue and return the correct result for the failing test.

This corrected version directly compares the sorted blocks within the BlockManager instances and then returns the appropriate result based on the comparison. It should now pass the failing test scenario.
