### Analyzing the buggy function
The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal. It compares the `axes` and `blocks` properties of the two instances. If the lengths of the axes are different, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it proceeds to compare the corresponding axes and blocks.

The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is failing because it is returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Potential error locations
1. The comparison of the `axes` property of the two `BlockManager` instances may not be working as expected.
2. The ordering and comparison of the `blocks` property might be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug
The bug may be caused by incorrect ordering of blocks during comparison, resulting in a mismatch when comparing equivalent but differently ordered blocks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the ordering and comparison of blocks are correct and that the `equals` function returns the expected result for equivalent `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the axes
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(
        ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)
    ):
        return False

    # Consolidate the BlockManager instances
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Compare the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Get a canonical ordering of the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    # Sort the blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the `axes` are compared correctly and that the `blocks` are sorted and compared in a canonical order before checking for equality. This should ensure that the `equals` function returns the expected result for equivalent `BlockManager` instances.
