To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that it correctly handles the comparison of DataFrames based on their content, not their positions. 

The cause of the bug primarily lies in the sorting of blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. This sorting is causing the bug to misclassify the dataframes as equal even when their content is different.

To fix this bug, we should adjust the `canonicalize` function so that it considers the actual content of the blocks for sorting, rather than their metadata. We'll also need to make sure that the comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function is based on their content. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to use the actual content of the blocks for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the content of the DataFrames, ensuring that their order or location does not impact the comparison. This should address the issue reported in GitHub and make the failing test case pass.
