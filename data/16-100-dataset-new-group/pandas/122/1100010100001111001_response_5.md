Based on the provided code for the buggy function and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug occurs when comparing the blocks. The function compares the blocks without considering the order in which they are stored, leading to erroneous comparisons.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to compare the blocks based on their index position, ensuring that blocks are properly aligned for comparison regardless of their original order.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on index position
    self_blocks = {idx: block for idx, block in enumerate(self.blocks)}
    other_blocks = {idx: block for idx, block in enumerate(other.blocks)}
    
    return all(
        self_blocks[idx].equals(other_blocks[idx]) for idx in self_blocks
    )
```

By modifying the comparison of blocks to consider their index position, we ensure that the blocks are aligned correctly for comparison, fixing the bug.
