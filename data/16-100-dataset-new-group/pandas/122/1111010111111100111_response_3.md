The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the contents of two DataFrames to determine equality. The method is expecting identical blocks to have the same locations, but in the failing test, the blocks have different locations. This causes the method to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be modified to compare the contents of the blocks rather than their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.ravel().tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.ravel().tolist())
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on the flattened values of the blocks, which ensures that the blocks with the same contents are compared for equality, regardless of their locations.

This correction should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
