The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function fails because it is not properly handling the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

The cause of the bug can be identified in the error message, which shows that the comparison `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails with the message `assert True is False`. This indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing the two `BlockManager` objects.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function properly iterates over and compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects to determine their equality.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.max())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function combines the type name and `mgr_locs` values of the blocks to ensure that unconsolidated blocks can be distinguished by their iteration order. Then, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted using the `canonicalize` function. Finally, the function iterates over the sorted blocks and checks for equality.
