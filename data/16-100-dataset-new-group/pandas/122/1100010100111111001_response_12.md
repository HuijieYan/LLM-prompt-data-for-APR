The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality but is failing to do so, resulting in a failed test. The error message shows that the function is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The cause of the bug is the improper comparison logic and block canonicalization. The function fails to properly compare and canonicalize the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic and block canonicalization need to be corrected. Specifically, the function should properly compare the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. Block canonicalization should be performed based on the dtype name and mgr_locs to ensure correct ordering for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.
