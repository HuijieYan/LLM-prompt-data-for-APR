First, let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, related functions, and the failing test.

The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. This function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances and then compares the blocks within them.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method. We expect the method to return `False` since the two DataFrames have different values and types for columns 'a' and 'b'.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`
2. Sorting and comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` method which is not in scope

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of the two instances.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` method to correctly compare the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for i, (ax1, ax2) in enumerate(zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for i, (block, oblock) in enumerate(zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.
