The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return False when it's actually expected to return True.

The bug is in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. However, the `.as_array.tolist()` method is not valid for `mgr_locs` causing the sorting to be incorrect, which ultimately leads to the wrong comparison and the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to use a proper method to convert `mgr_locs` to a list for sorting.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `mgr_locs` is used directly without conversion, as it already represents a valid sorting order. This will ensure that the `equals` function compares the blocks correctly and passes the failing test.
