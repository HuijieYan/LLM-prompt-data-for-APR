The issue with the `equals` function is likely due to the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The function sorts both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, and then checks if each block equals the corresponding block in the other list. However, it seems that the sorting operation using the `canonicalize` function might not be functioning correctly.

The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs. It's expected that after sorting, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should have the same order for the comparison. It's possible that the `mgr_locs` are not being sorted correctly.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function is correctly returning the tuple of dtype and mgr_locs. Additionally, when comparing the blocks, we need to ensure that the order of the blocks is maintained after sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the correction, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple of the type and mgr_locs. Additionally, when comparing the blocks, the correct order is maintained after sorting. These changes should ensure that the `equals` function works as expected and passes the failing test.
