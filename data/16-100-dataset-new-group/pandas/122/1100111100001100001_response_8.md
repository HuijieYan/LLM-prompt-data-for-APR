The bug in the given function seems to be caused by the comparison of the 'mgr_locs' attribute of the 'block' variable. The 'mgr_locs' attribute seems to be an instance of the 'BlockPlacement' class, and the logic for comparing it with other 'mgr_locs' is missing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison for 'mgr_locs' is properly handled when sorting and comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the 'canonicalize' function properly handles the 'mgr_locs' attribute when sorting the blocks for comparison. Additionally, it converts the 'mgr_locs' into a string for comparison, ensuring that the comparison is meaningful and consistent.
