The bug in the equals function is causing it to always return True, even when the DataFrames are not equal. This bug is causing the failing test to assert True is False, leading to the failing test.

The cause of the bug lies in the canonicalize function used within the equals function to sort the blocks of the self and other DataFrames. The canonicalize function currently returns a tuple of (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()), which is used for sorting. However, the block.dtype.name is not appropriate for determining equality, as it depends on the type of values in the block, which may differ while the blocks are still equal. This results in the DataFrames being wrongly considered equal.

To fix this bug, the canonicalize function should be updated to only include the block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() when creating the tuple for sorting. Removing the block.dtype.name from the tuple will prevent it from affecting the equality comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to only include mgr_locs for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this update, the equals function will correctly compare DataFrames for equality and pass the failing test.
