### Correction:

Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The `equals` method is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances and return `False` if they are not equal. However, the current implementation may not be correctly identifying differences in the blocks' locations.

There appears to be a nested function `canonicalize` that is intended to compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. This function sorts the blocks using the type name and manager locations to determine if the two `BlockManager` instances are equal.

To fix the bug, I would recommend modifying the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the comparison of blocks. Additionally, I would consider changing the comparison logic within the `equals` method to account for differences in block positions.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate()
    other._consolidate()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, I removed the call to the `_consolidate_inplace` function and directly compared the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. This should address the issue of incorrect comparisons due to differences in block positions.

After making these changes, the `equals` method should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.

Please consider testing the corrected code and ensuring that it resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
