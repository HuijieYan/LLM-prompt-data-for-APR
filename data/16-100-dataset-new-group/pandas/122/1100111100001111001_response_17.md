The bug in the current implementation seems to be related to the canonicalization of blocks. The function is comparing the blocks of two BlockManagers and sorting them for comparison using a canonicalize function. However, the canonicalize function is not correctly defined within the class, leading to a NameError when called. Also, the bug might be related to the comparison of axes and the consolidate_inplace function calls.

To fix the bug, we should define the canonicalize function properly within the BlockManager class and address any issues with the axes comparison and consolidate_inplace calls.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods)

    # this is the fixed function
    def equals(self, other):
        # Compare the axes
        if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
            return False
        for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes):
            if not ax1.equals(ax2):
                return False
        
        # Consolidate inplace for both BlockManagers
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        # Compare the number of blocks
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Define the canonicalize function properly
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

        # Sort the blocks based on canonicalization
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # Compare the sorted blocks
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if not block.equals(oblock):
                return False

        return True
```

This corrected version addresses the issues by properly defining the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class and handling the axes comparison. Additionally, it consolidates the blocks inplace before comparison.
