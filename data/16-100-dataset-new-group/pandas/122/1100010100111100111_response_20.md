## Explanation

The `equals` method in the buggy function is designed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. However, it has a bug that causes it to return `True` when the two BlockManagers have identical blocks with different locations. 

Potential error locations include:
1. Comparison of lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Comparison of lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
3. Sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using `canonicalize` function.

The bug causes the `equals` method to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` in the failing test. This is evident from the error message `assert True is False` and the mismatched runtime input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be adjusted to ensure that it correctly identifies cases where identical blocks have different locations.

## Fixed Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values, block.items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `canonicalize` function now sorts the blocks based on their `mgr_locs`, `values`, and `items` to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly marked as equal.
2. The `equals` method will now return the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, as in the failing test scenario.
