Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method returning `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations, which contradicts the expected behavior.

The bug appears to be in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. When comparing the blocks, it does not take into account the order of the elements within the blocks, resulting in incorrect equality comparisons for certain cases.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to sort the block elements based on their types and locations.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # ... (other functions)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Updated canonicalize block order to consider type and locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method should correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations and ensure that the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the GitHub issue passes as expected.
