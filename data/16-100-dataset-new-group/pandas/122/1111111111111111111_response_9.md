The issue with the buggy function `equals` is that it incorrectly returns `True` even when the two DataFrames being compared have identical blocks with different locations. This is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to raise an AssertionError.

The input parameters to the function are `self` and `other`, both of type `BlockManager`, and their `axes` and `blocks` attributes.

Based on the given failing test and associated runtime and expected values, the bug is likely occurring during the process of sorting and comparing the blocks within the `equals` function. The location and ordering of the blocks need to be properly accounted for to ensure that matching blocks are correctly identified as equal.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to handle the comparison of block locations properly. This involves:
1. Sorting the blocks based on type name and location to ensure consistent ordering.
2. Comparing the sorted blocks to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in other.blocks]
    
    self_blocks.sort()
    other_blocks.sort()
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected version of the function sorts the blocks based on type name and location before comparing them for equality. It addresses the issue reported in the failing test and should resolve the problem mentioned in the corresponding GitHub issue.
