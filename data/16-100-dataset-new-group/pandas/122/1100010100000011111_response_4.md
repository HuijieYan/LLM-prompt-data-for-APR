The bug in the equals method of the buggy function is likely due to the `canonicalize` function not properly sorting the blocks. This causes the equals method to incorrectly return `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the type of the block and sort the blocks based on their type as well as their locations. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly distinguished.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type, name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
With this correction, the equals method should now properly handle identical blocks with different locations and return the expected output of `False` as stated in the GitHub issue.
