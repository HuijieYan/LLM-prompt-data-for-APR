The bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class seems to be caused by the sorting of self.blocks and other.blocks using the canonicalize function. The canonicalize function is designed to return a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs, but it is not defined within the BlockManager class, resulting in an unresolved reference error when used.

To fix the bug, we need to define the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class and ensure that it correctly returns a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs. Then, the sorted blocks can be compared to check for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function to combine type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By defining the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class and ensuring it returns the expected tuple value, the equals method should now work correctly and return the expected result for the given input.
