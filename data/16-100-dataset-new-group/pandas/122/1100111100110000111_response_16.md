Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The use of the `_consolidate_inplace` method may be causing unexpected behavior.
2. The sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function may not be working as expected.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the way blocks are being compared and sorted within the `equals` function. It may be causing identical blocks with different locations to be incorrectly evaluated as equal.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the `_consolidate_inplace` method to ensure it is functioning correctly and not introducing unexpected behavior.
2. Verify the sorting logic using the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it correctly handles identical blocks with different locations.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the blocks to ensure consistent comparisons
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to canonicalize the block for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    # Sort the blocks using the canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if each pair of blocks are equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses potential issues with block consolidation and sorting for proper comparison. It should resolve the bug and ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly evaluated as not equal.
