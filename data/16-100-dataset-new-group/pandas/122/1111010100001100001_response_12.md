The buggy function "equals" from the BlockManager class is intended to compare two instances of BlockManager for equality. However, there is a bug in the logic that prevents the comparison from being accurate. The bug is likely located in the code that canonicalizes and sorts the blocks before comparing them.

The bug is likely caused by the fact that the canonicalization process for the blocks is not considering the manager locations (mgr_locs) correctly. This results in the blocks being sorted and compared incorrectly, leading to false results.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization process needs to consider the manager locations (mgr_locs) of the blocks as an integral part of the comparison. This will ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared accurately.

Here's a corrected version of the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the canonicalization process of the blocks now includes the manager locations (mgr_locs) as part of the comparison tuple. This ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared accurately, addressing the bug in the original function.
