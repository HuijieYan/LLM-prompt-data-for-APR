### Analysis
The error message states that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is not passing because it's evaluating to True instead. This contradicts the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue. The issue description also confirms that the `df3.equals(df4)` call is not returning the expected result.

### Error Location
The error is likely to be in the `canonicalize` function, where the `mgr_locs` may not be correctly handled for unconsolidated blocks. This can lead to an incorrect comparison when checking for equality.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of unconsolidated blocks when comparing DataFrames for equality. This leads to the equals method returning True incorrectly, causing the failing test and the issue on GitHub.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Make sure to correctly consolidate the blocks of the dataframes before executing the comparison.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to handle unconsolidated blocks correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        block._consolidate_inplace()
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, the function will consolidate the dataframes and their blocks correctly before performing the equality check, which should resolve the bug reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test passes.
