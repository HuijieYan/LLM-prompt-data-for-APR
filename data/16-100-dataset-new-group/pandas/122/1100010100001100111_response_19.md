### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return incorrect results, leading to failing tests. The comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is not taking into consideration the different locations of identical blocks, resulting in a false positive when blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the blocks to take into account the block locations. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location and then use this modified canonicalized block to compare the blocks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and block values to consider block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
