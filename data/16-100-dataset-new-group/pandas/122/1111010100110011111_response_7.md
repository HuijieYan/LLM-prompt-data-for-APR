## Explanation
The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is likely because the method is not properly comparing the content of the dataframes.

The method first checks if the axis labels are equal, which is expected behavior. Then, it consolidates the internal structure (blocks) of the dataframes and compares their lengths. However, the comparison of the blocks is faulty and leads to the incorrect result.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison of individual blocks within the dataframes. The comparison is based on the data type name and the manager locations, but it is failing to correctly identify differences in the blocks.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the comparison of blocks is accurate. This may involve comparing the actual data within the blocks to determine equality, rather than just their data type and location information.

## Corrected Code
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return self_axes.equals(other_axes) and all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version improves the block comparison by using the `equals` method of the axes and comparing the content of the blocks directly. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
