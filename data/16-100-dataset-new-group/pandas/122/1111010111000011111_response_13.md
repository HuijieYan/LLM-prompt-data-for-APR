The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations. This is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not properly considering the locations of the blocks when comparing them. It is only comparing the content of the blocks, which leads to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to consider the locations of the blocks in addition to their content when performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks and their locations
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not (block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version first sorts the blocks based on both their content and their locations, and then compares them one by one, ensuring that both content and locations match.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to the incorrect return value of `equals` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
