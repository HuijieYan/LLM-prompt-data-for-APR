The bug in the function "equals" seems to be with the comparison of the "self_axes" and "other_axes" and with the sorting and comparison of "self_blocks" and "other_blocks".

The test case "test_dataframe_not_equal" is expecting the comparison of two dataframes with different column data to return False, but this is not happening due to the bugs in the function "equals".

To fix the bug, we can modify the "equals" function to compare the data and shapes of the two dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not (self.values == other.values).all():
        return False
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False
    return True
```

In this corrected version, we are directly comparing the "values" attribute of the dataframes and also checking if their shapes are the same. This should fix the bug and make the failing test case pass.
