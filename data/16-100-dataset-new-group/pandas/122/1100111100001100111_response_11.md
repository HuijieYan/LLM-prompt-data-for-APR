## Bug Fix Strategy
After looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it seems that the issue lies within the `canonicalize` function that is used to sort the blocks. The `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object is not being accessed properly, resulting in incorrect sorting of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object and convert it to a list for proper sorting.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The corrected buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `canonicalize` function now correctly accesses the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object and converts it to a list for proper sorting. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
