The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances. The failing test case shows that the expected output is `False`, but the actual output is `True`. 

The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances, and then consolidates them before further comparison. However, the bug seems to arise from the sorting and canonicalization of the `blocks` attribute.

The potential error locations within the buggy `equals` function could be:
1. Incorrect comparisons of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Inappropriate canonicalization of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug may be due to the incorrect sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before the comparison. This can lead to differences between blocks being overlooked, causing the function to return `True` erroneously.

To fix the bug, the sorting and canonicalization of blocks need to be revised. Instead of sorting by `canonicalize` and then comparing blocks, it may be more appropriate to directly compare unsorted blocks. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The revised version removes the unnecessary sorting and canonicalization of blocks, directly comparing the blocks to ensure that differences are not overlooked. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected output.
