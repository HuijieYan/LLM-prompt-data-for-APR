The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class, located in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality and returns a boolean value.

### Bug
The bug in the `equals` method is likely occurring in the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. The specific bug is causing the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to produce the wrong result.

The bug is likely related to the comparison of different block types using the `equals` method, which results in incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks. This leads to the method incorrectly determining that the two `BlockManager` instances are equal when they are not.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account the data types and values within the blocks. Specifically, when sorting and comparing the blocks, we need to consider the type name and the locations of the blocks to ensure a correct comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare blocks based on type name and block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added a `canonicalize` function to facilitate sorting and comparing the blocks based on the type name and block locations. Then, I used this function to sort the blocks before comparing them using the `equals` method, ensuring that the comparison includes the necessary information about the block types and locations. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` method behave as expected.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` and produce the correct result.
