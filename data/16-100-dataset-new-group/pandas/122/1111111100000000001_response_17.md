The buggy function is the `equals()` method within the `BlockManager` class in the pandas package. The function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without first checking if either of them is empty.
2. Comparing the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without first checking if either of them is empty.
3. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists without first checking if either of them is empty.
4. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once inside the `BlockManager` class and once outside.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle cases where `self_axes` or `other_axes` are empty or where `self.blocks` or `other.blocks` are empty. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and potential IndexErrors.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Add a check at the beginning of the function to handle the case where `self_axes` or `other_axes` is empty, returning False if either is true.
2. Add a check after accessing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to handle the case where either of them is empty, returning False if either is true.
3. Remove the duplicate `canonicalize` function definition inside the `BlockManager` class to avoid confusion and potential errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if not self_axes or not other_axes:
        return False
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if not self.blocks or not other.blocks:
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With these changes, the `equals()` function now handles empty `self_axes` or `other_axes` as well as empty `self.blocks` or `other.blocks` lists, making the function more robust and less prone to errors.
