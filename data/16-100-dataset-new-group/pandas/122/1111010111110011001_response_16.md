The issue seems to be with the equality check in the `BlockManager` class's `equals` method. The method is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class, but it's failing the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` because it's returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two different dataframes.

The problem lies in the part of the code where it compares `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. The sorting is being done based on a tuple combining the type name and then `mgr_locs`, which might result in unconsolidated blocks being compared wrongly.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `canonicalize` function to use a combination of the block type and other meaningful attributes to ensure correct comparison between blocks. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and additional attributes for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This revised version should correctly handle the comparison of different dataframes and pass the failing test.
