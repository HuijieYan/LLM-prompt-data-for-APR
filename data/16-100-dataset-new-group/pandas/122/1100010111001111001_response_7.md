The issue in the `equals` function seems to be related to how the `BlockManager` objects are being compared. The function is attempting to compare different `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks, but it is not handling the comparison of the blocks correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The suggested fix would be to modify the logic for comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects to ensure that they are compared correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not compare_blocks(block1, block2):
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected version explicitly loops through the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects and compares each pair of blocks using the `equals` method. If any pair of blocks are found to be not equal, the function returns `False`. If all the blocks are found to be equal, the function returns `True`. This ensures that the comparison of the `BlockManager` objects is done correctly and should address the issue with the failing test.
