The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. 

Based on the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`, the function fails to correctly identify that two dataframes, `df1` and `df2`, are not equal. This is due to the specific implementation of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class.

### Error Location:
The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, where it doesn't correctly distinguish between identical blocks with different locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle identical blocks with different locations correctly. When comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, the function does not account for blocks that have the same content but are located at different positions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to account for identical blocks with different locations. One potential strategy would be to re-implement the comparison logic for blocks, taking into account their content as well as their position within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function takes into account the block's content and location, and the comparison logic is updated to consider this information when comparing blocks.

This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes.
