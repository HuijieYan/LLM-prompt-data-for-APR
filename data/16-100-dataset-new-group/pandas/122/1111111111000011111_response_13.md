Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the related class, the failing test, and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug occurs when the `equals` method is used to compare two dataframes that have identical blocks but different locations. This results in the method wrongly returning `True` instead of `False`, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the comparison process does not take into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. This leads to a false positive comparison result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to properly account for blocks with identical content but different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a modified `canonicalize` function that compares the block values and their locations to properly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.

This should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.
