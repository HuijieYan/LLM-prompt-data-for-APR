The buggy function `equals` is part of the `managers.py` module in the `pandas` library. The function is supposed to compare two objects and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise. However, the function contains a bug that causes it to return an incorrect result, leading to a failing test.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the blocks.
2. The canonicalization of blocks using `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is due to the fact that the function is not handling the comparison of the data within the DataFrame correctly, resulting in the incorrect comparison outcome. This leads to the failing test and the corresponding error message, which states that the assertion `True is False` failed.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to be modified to accurately compare the data within the DataFrames.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the axes
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate inplace
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare the blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare data within each block
    for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if block1.shape != block2.shape:
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(block1.values, block2.values):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In this corrected version, the comparison logic within the `equals` function has been modified to accurately compare the data within the DataFrames. The comparison now includes comparing the shape and the values of each block, which ensures a more accurate determination of equality between the two DataFrame objects.
