The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The purpose of this function is to compare two `BlockManager` instances and check if they are equal.

The potential error in the `equals` method is that it compares the blocks of the `self` and `other` instances without properly consolidating them. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and returning false negatives even when the instances are actually equal.

The cause of the bug is that the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are not properly consolidated, leading to incorrect comparisons. This can happen when the blocks are not in the same order, even if they contain the same data.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are consolidated in the same order before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are properly consolidated and sorted before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is accurate and does not produce false negatives. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` method pass the failing test.
