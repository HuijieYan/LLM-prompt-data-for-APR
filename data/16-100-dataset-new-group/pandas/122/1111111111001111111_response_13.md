To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue related to the comparison of blocks with identical content but different locations. The issue is causing the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two dataframes with the same content but different block locations. This is contrary to the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their type and location. This causes identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic used for comparing the blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of relying on the order of blocks, we should compare the content of the blocks directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    # Directly compare the content of the blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(other_blocks[i]) for i, block in enumerate(self_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will compare the content of the blocks directly, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.

This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well as satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test case.
