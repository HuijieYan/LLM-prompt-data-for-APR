        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        )
```

Explanation:
The issue in the original function arises when sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which returns a tuple and stores it in the `mgr_locs` attribute. However, during the runtime, `mgr_locs` is converted to a list (`as_array.tolist()`), but it should not be converted to a list. The correction in the `canonicalize` function ensures that the output preserves the expected values. This fix aligns the runtime output values with the expected output values and resolves the issue reported in GitHub.
