The issue with the equals function arises from the sorting algorithm inside the function. Since the original block order is not preserved after sorting, despite the blocks being equal, the function returns False.

To fix this bug, we can modify the canonicalize function to include the original position of the block so that the order is preserved after sorting. We can add the parameter loc to the canonicalize function and modify the sorted calls to include the loc.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function with the fix applied:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block, loc):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), loc)

    self_blocks = sorted([(block, loc) for loc, block in enumerate(self.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(*x))
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, loc) for loc, block in enumerate(other.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(*x))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the equals function should now return the correct result and pass the failing test case.
