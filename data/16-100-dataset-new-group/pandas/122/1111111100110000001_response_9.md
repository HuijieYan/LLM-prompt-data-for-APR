The buggy function in the provided source code is the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. This function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances and check if they are equal. The function first compares the axes of the two instances, then consolidates them and finally compares the blocks.

The error message from the failing test is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it is returning `True` instead.

One potential error location within the `equals` function is the comparison of the axes. There might be an issue with the comparison logic that causes it to return `True` even when the axes are not equal.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the axes and blocks should be carefully reviewed. Additionally, the consolidation process should also be reviewed to ensure it is working as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the logic for comparing axes and blocks is revised to ensure that it accurately determines the equality of the `BlockManager` instances. Additionally, the canonicalization of blocks has been updated to use the `tobytes` method to convert the block values, ensuring that unconsolidated blocks are distinguished in the tuple comparison.
