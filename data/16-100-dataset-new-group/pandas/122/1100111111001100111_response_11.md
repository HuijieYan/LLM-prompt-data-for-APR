Based on the provided information, it seems that the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly returning `True` in some cases where it should return `False`. 

The bug appears to be related to the sorting of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` before comparing their equality, specifically in the `canonicalize` function. The faulty comparison causes the function to incorrectly determine that the two DataFrames are equal when they are actually not. This issue was identified in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

To fix the bug, the sorting criteria in the `canonicalize` function must be revised to properly handle the comparison of blocks' dtype and mgr_loc information.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Revised canonicalize function to handle dtype and mgr_locs correctly
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, ABCDataFrame):
            return (type(block), block._data.as_array().tolist())
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By revising the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the sorting of blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs for DataFrame blocks, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
