The bug in the provided function is caused by the comparison of DataFrame objects df1 and df2 using the `equals` method, which is expected to return False. However, the function returns True, causing the test to fail. The issue originates from the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.

The algorithm fails to correctly compare the blocks in the two DataFrames. The `canonicalize` function, which is used for sorting the blocks before comparison, does not return the correct values. This causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return True, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be updated to correctly produce the desired sorting order for the blocks. Additionally, the sorting process for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` needs to be fixed to use the updated `canonicalize` function. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), [str(loc) for loc in block.mgr_locs])

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should correctly compare the DataFrames and return the expected results when tested.
