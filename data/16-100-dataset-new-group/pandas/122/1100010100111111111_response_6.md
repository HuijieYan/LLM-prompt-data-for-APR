The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` incorrectly instead of `False` for the given test case. This is due to a failure in comparing the sorted blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. When comparing the blocks, the function mistakenly returns `True` when it should be `False`. This results in the failing test case and the reported GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic for the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects needs to be revised. Specifically, the logic for comparing the sorted blocks based on the `canonicalize` function needs to be corrected to ensure that correct results are returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_sorted_blocks) != len(other_sorted_blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will now handle the comparison of sorted blocks more accurately, allowing it to pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
