The root cause of the bug: 
The buggy function `equals` is using the `canonicalize` function to sort and compare the blocks within `BlockManager`. However, the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the `BlockManager` class and again inside the class. Due to this, the `canonicalize` function defined outside the class is being used within the `equals` function, which leads to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the `canonicalize` function from outside the `BlockManager` class to avoid confusion and incorrect usage.
2. Modify the `equals` function to use the `canonicalize` function defined within the class for sorting and comparison of the blocks.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# Remove the redundant definition of canonicalize function outside the BlockManager class

# Modified version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Use the canonicalize function within the class for sorting the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making these changes, the function now correctly uses the `canonicalize` function within the class, which should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes.
