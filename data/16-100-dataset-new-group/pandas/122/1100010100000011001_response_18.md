The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, but it does not handle the case where these blocks could have different types and manager locations but still equal. Additionally, the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method could also cause the bug if it doesn't properly handle cases where the blocks are equal but not identical.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly compare the blocks based on their content and data, rather than just their type name and manager locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks based on their content
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block._fastpath_liable_equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we compare the blocks using the `_fastpath_liable_equals` method, which checks for equality based on the block's content and data, rather than just their type name and manager locations.

This should ensure that the function returns the correct result based on the content of the blocks, as expected in the test cases.
