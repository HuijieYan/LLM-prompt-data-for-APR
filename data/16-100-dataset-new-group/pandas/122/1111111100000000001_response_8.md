The bug in the provided function `equals` is that it relies on the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` attributes to compare the equality of two BlockManager objects. However, the `blocks` attribute is not defined within the `BlockManager` class, which could result in an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `blocks` attribute is properly defined within the `BlockManager` class or passed as an argument to the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Assuming blocks are stored in self and other, replacing self.blocks and other.blocks
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we assume that the `blocks` attribute is indeed stored within `self` and `other`, and we replace `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` with those attributes.

However, if the `blocks` attribute should be defined within the class itself, we need to add the attribute definition within the `BlockManager` class.
