The buggy function `equals` is used to determine if two BlockManager objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The function starts by comparing the length and equality of the axes of the two BlockManager objects. Then it calls the `_consolidate_inplace` method on both objects, which may alter their states. Lastly, it compares the blocks within the two BlockManager objects, taking into account the data type and location.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` function, but it is expecting the comparison to be `False` when it is actually resulting in `True`.

The issue is likely with how the function compares the blocks within the BlockManager objects, as this is the final step in determining equality. It may be sorting the blocks incorrectly or comparing them incorrectly.

To fix this bug, the comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager objects should be reviewed to ensure it is properly sorting and comparing them. Additionally, any potential side effects caused by calling the `_consolidate_inplace` method should be considered.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return (block1.values == block2.values).all()

    return all(
        compare_blocks(self.blocks[i], other.blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self.blocks))
    )
```
