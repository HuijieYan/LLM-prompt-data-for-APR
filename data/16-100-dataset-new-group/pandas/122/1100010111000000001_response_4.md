    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Using str() to get the dtype name as a string

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

```

Explanation:
The buggy function is comparing two DataFrames using the 'equals' method. The bug in the function is caused by not handling different data types in the DataFrames correctly, resulting in the comparison failing.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the 'canonicalize' function to convert the dtype name to a string using the 'str()' function. This will ensure that the comparison of DataFrames with different data types will be handled correctly.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
