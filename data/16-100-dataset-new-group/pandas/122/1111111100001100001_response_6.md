The bug in the provided equals function lies in the canonicalize function. The canonicalize function is meant to sort the blocks using a tuple that combines the type name and mgr_locs. However, the canonicalize function is not a member of the class and is called directly within the buggy equals function. This leads to an error as the canonicalize function is not properly defined within the equals function.

To fix this bug, the canonicalize function should be defined within the equals function or moved to the top level and made a helper function. Additionally, the canonicalize function should take 'self' as a parameter since it is being used to access the attributes of the BlockManager class.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(other, block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
