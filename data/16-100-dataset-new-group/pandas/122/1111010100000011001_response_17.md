The buggy function `equals` is comparing the attributes of two instances of the BlockManager class, namely `self` and `other`. The function compares the axes, then consolidates the data, sorts and canonicalizes the blocks, and then compares the individual blocks. 

The bug in the function may be related to the comparison of the axes, the consolidation of the data, or the comparison of the blocks.

The bug may be caused by inconsistencies in the canonicalization process of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the consolidation and canonicalization of the blocks are performed correctly, and that the comparison logic is accurate.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks.values()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.values()
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    sorted_self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    sorted_other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(sorted_self_blocks, sorted_other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issues by ensuring that the blocks are correctly consolidated and then sorted before the comparison, using the `values()` method to retrieve the block values.

With this corrected version, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values defined in the test cases.
