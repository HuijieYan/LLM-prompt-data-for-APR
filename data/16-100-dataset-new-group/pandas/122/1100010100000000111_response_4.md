The buggy function `equals` is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to wrongly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue. 

The potential error location in the function is the usage of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, where the blocks are being compared based on their order and locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.

The bug is caused by comparing the blocks based on their order and locations, which does not properly consider the actual values within the blocks. This results in the `equals` method returning true even when the blocks contain different values but have the same order and locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the values within the blocks rather than their order and locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare the values within the blocks
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the values within the blocks using the `equals` method of the block values rather than comparing the blocks based on order and locations. This modification ensures that the comparison is based on the actual values within the blocks, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
