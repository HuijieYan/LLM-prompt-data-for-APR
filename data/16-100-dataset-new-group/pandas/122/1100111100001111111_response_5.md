The bug in the given code causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` in cases where two DataFrames have identical blocks but with different locations. This issue was reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The bug seems to be related to the sorting of the blocks in the `equals` method. The method is sorting the blocks based on the block's dtype and mgr_locs, which could be causing it to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to more accurately represent the block's attributes before sorting. We can consider sorting only based on the block's dtype for simplicity.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort the blocks based on dtype only
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method should now correctly return `False` in the case where two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
