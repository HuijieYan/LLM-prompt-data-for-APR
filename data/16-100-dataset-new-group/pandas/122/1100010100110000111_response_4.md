## Analysis
The error message indicates that the function `equals` is returning True instead of False, when it should be returning False. This behavior is not expected and does not align with the intended functionality of the function. The GitHub issue also mentions that the `equals` method is returning True when comparing identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect.

## Potential Error
The potential error lies in the way the function `canonicalize` is being used to sort the blocks in the two DataFrames. It seems that the sorting mechanism is flawed and not correctly identifying the identical blocks with different locations.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is the flawed sorting mechanism within the `canonicalize` function, which leads to incorrect identification of identical blocks with different locations. This causes the `equals` method to return True when it should return False.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the sorting mechanism in the `canonicalize` function to correctly identify and sort the blocks. Additionally, the comparison logic for the blocks needs to be adjusted to consider the different locations of identical blocks.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been modified to use the `values` of the block and the `mgr_locs` as the sorting criteria. This change ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified and sorted.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
