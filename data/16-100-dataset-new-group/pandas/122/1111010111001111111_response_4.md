## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Check the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Compare the blocks based on block values
    for i, (block_a, block_b) in enumerate(zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        if block_a.shape != block_b.shape:
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(block_a.values, block_b.values):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version of the `equals` function, we first check whether the axes of the two BlockManagers are equal, and return False if they are not. Then, we compare the number of blocks and ensure that they are the same. Next, we consolidate the BlockManagers in place to ensure that we are comparing consolidated blocks.

After that, we iterate through each block and check if the shape and values of the blocks are equal. If any block is found to be different between the BlockManagers, we return False. Otherwise, we return True at the end.

This corrected approach ensures that we compare the actual block values to determine if the BlockManagers are equal, fixing the bug outlined in the GitHub issue.
