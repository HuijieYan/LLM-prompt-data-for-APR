The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is failing to correctly identify that two DataFrames are not equal due to a bug in the `canonicalize` function. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` is triggering an assertion error because it expects `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False` but it is returning `True`.

The buggy function is failing because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is not properly designed to handle the given test case, resulting in incorrect comparison of the blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify how the blocks are sorted in the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that the sorting logic reflects the actual data comparison requirements.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on the block type name, location, and values, ensuring a proper comparison of the blocks. This will address the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` passes as expected.
