The bug in the function `equals` is likely causing the failing test. The function is comparing the equality of two BlockManager instances by sorting the blocks within each manager and then comparing each block between them. It seems that the function is attempting to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs` attribute values. 

On closer examination, it appears that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once inside the `BlockManager` class and once outside. This could lead to ambiguity and confusion in the function. This could be a potential cause of the bug.

A possible fix for this bug is to remove the `canonicalize` function from the `BlockManager` class, as it is not being called. Then, within the `equals` function, define the `canonicalize` function outside of the `BlockManager` class and utilize it to sort the blocks before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function outside the BlockManager class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the function should sort the blocks and compare them as expected, resolving the failing test case.
