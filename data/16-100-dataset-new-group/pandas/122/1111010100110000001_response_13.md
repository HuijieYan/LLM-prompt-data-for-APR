The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. Incorrect comparison logic.
2. Incorrect sorting logic for blocks.
3. Incorrect handling of dtype and mgr_locs during sorting.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. This leads to the incorrect equality comparison and the failing test.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be corrected and the sorting of blocks needs to be properly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.__array__().tolist()) # to convert the dtype to string and use __array__ method to convert mgr_locs to an array

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With these corrections, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` objects for equality and pass the failing test.
