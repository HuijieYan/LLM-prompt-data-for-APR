## The fixed version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Explanation:
- The bug in the original code was due to using the `name` attribute of the `dtype` object, which returned the data type name as the string, instead of directly converting the `dtype` object to a string. This resulted in a comparison error when trying to determine equality between `Dtype` objects. 
- Additionally, there was an error with the call to `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This should be replaced with `mgr_locs.as_slice()`.
- To fix this bug, I modified the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple containing the string representation of the data type (`str(block.dtype)`) and the slice representation of `mgr_locs`.
- By doing this, I modified the comparison between blocks to correctly compare `dtype` objects and the locations using `block.mgr_locs.as_slice()`. This ensures that the correct comparison is made, fixing the bug.
