The issue with the buggy function is that it is comparing the blocks of `self` and `other`, but it is not taking into account the order of the blocks. Additionally, there is a duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class.

The bug is causing the failing test to assert `True is False`, indicating that the `df1.equals(df2)` is returning True when it should be False.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be defined only once and used within the equals function to properly compare the blocks of `self` and `other` based on their types and positions. Additionally, the `_consolidate_inplace` function should be called on both `self` and `other` before comparing their blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function only once
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test case should pass, and the function should properly compare the equality of the blocks in `self` and `other`.
