The potential error locations within the `equals` function are not properly handling the comparison of the axes and blocks between the two instances.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly compare the axes and blocks of the two instances. It also does not properly consolidate the blocks before comparison. This can lead to incorrect results when determining if the two instances are equal.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the axes and blocks are compared correctly and that the blocks are consolidated before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self._rebuild_blknos_and_blklocs()
    other_blocks = other._rebuild_blknos_and_blklocs()

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly call the `_consolidate_inplace` method for both `self` and `other` instances to ensure their blocks are consolidated before comparison. We also use the `_rebuild_blknos_and_blklocs` method to rebuild the block numbers and block locations before comparing the blocks.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks between the two instances is done correctly.
