The issue in the buggy function is with the way it compares the data blocks. It fails to compare them properly and in the correct order. This results in the failing test case where two DataFrames that are not equal are being incorrectly asserted as equal.

To fix the bug, the comparison of data blocks needs to be corrected so that the DataFrames are properly evaluated for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.to_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `to_array()` method on `mgr_locs` to convert it to a regular array and then sorting the data blocks based on their data type and location, the corrected function should properly compare the DataFrames for equality.

This correction should address the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values, and fixing the bug.
