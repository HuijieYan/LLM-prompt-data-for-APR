The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of the blocks. The failure of the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` indicates that the `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two different dataframes.

The issue arises from the `canonicalize` function, where the order of sorting the blocks is not being handled correctly. This is causing the comparison to fail and return the wrong result.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider the order of sorting the blocks correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case and correctly compare two dataframes.
