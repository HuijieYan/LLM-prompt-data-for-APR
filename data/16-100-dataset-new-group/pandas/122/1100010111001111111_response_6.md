Based on the runtime values, the cause of the bug in the provided function is related to the sorting of blocks based on the dtype name and manager location. This sorting is not consistent with the expected behavior, resulting in the `equals` function returning False when it should actually return True for identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the sorting based on dtype name and manager location needs to be revised to ensure consistent comparison of blocks. Additionally, the comparison process should be updated to correctly identify identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update the canonicalize function to compare blocks consistently
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    # Update the comparison process to correctly identify identical blocks with different locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) or block.values_eq(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and align with the expected behavior, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
