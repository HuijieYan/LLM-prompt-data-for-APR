## The source code of the corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other functions from the same class
    ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block._equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With the corrected implementation, the function now correctly performs the comparison of the BlockManager objects by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks using a canonicalization function. This should resolve any issues related to sorting and comparison of the blocks.
