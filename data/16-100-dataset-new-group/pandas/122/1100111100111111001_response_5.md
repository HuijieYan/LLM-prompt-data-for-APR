The bug in the provided function is in the way it handles the comparison of the blocks. The issue arises from the canonicalize function, which is nested inside the equals function. The canonicalize function is defined twice, once inside the BlockManager class and once outside. This can cause confusion and lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the redundant canonicalize function definition and properly reference the canonicalize function from the BlockManager class. Additionally, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly by sorting and comparing the blocks in a way that aligns with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
