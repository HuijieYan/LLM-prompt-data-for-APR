## Plan for fixing the bug:
1. The buggy function is comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects using the `equals` method, which is causing the comparison to fail. 
2. The issue lies in the comparison logic of the blocks, which is not properly handling the data and types. 
3. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, but it seems to be not working correctly, causing the comparison to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function properly handles the blocks and sorts them based on their type and manager locations. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `equals` method compares the blocks correctly.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize and sort blocks based on their type and manager locations
    def canonicalize_and_sort(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = canonicalize_and_sort(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize_and_sort(other.blocks)

    return all(
        block.equals(other_block) for block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the buggy function should now properly compare the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects, addressing the issue and passing the failing test.
