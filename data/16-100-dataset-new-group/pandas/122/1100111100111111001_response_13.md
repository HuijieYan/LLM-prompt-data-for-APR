The issue in the buggy function is that it is using the wrong `block` variable when calling the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is expecting a `block` as a parameter, but the buggy function is calling it without providing the `block` as a parameter. This leads to the wrong comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the correct `block` needs to be passed as a parameter to the `canonicalize` function when it is called.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making this change, the correct block will be passed to the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is performed correctly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
