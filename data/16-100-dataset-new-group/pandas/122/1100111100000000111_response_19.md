The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is returning `True` even if the blocks have different locations, which is not the expected behavior. This is leading to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function correctly handles the comparison of blocks with different locations. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to account for block locations and sorting the blocks based on this modified `canonicalize` function.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize block order, combining the type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will now handle the comparison of blocks with different locations and return the expected results when comparing DataFrames.
