Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the `equals` function from the `BlockManager` class is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is likely due to a mismatch in the block order when comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. 

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to compare the block order based on the type name and manager locations. Additionally, proper sorting and comparison should be performed on the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now return the correct result when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
