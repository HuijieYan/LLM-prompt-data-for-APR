The buggy function `equals` is used to check if two DataFrames are equal. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, and shows that `df1.equals(df2)` evaluates to `True`, which is unexpected.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparisons performed inside the `equals` function, as well as the process of canonicalizing the blocks for comparison.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic inside the `equals` function is incorrect, leading to an incorrect evaluation of whether the two DataFrames are equal. Additionally, the process of canonicalizing the blocks for comparison might not be working as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly compare the DataFrames and ensure that the canonicalization of the blocks is done accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidating inplace before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order
    canonicalize_self_blocks = [
        (block.values, block.mgr_locs) for block in self.blocks
    ]
    canonicalize_other_blocks = [
        (block.values, block.mgr_locs) for block in other.blocks
    ]
    return canonicalize_self_blocks == canonicalize_other_blocks
```

The corrected function compares the axes of the DataFrames, consolidates them in place, compares the lengths of the blocks, and then generates canonicalized representations of the blocks to compare them. This version of the function should pass the failing test.
