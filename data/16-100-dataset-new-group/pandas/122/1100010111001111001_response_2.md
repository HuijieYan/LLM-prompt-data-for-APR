The buggy function `equals` is a method of a BlockManager class and is used to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The method checks if the axes of the two BlockManagers are equal and if the blocks within them are equal.

The potential error in the function is in the logic for comparing the blocks. The function uses a sorting mechanism based on the dtype name and mgr_locs to compare the blocks, which may not be effective for comparing the content of the blocks.

The failing test case 'test_dataframe_not_equal' compares two DataFrame objects and expects them to be different. When the function is called with the given input parameters, it does not return the expected output, which causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the actual content of the blocks, rather than using a sorting mechanism based on dtype name and mgr_locs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.flatten()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.flatten()

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are flattened and then compared for equality. This ensures that the content of the blocks is compared accurately.

After applying the correction, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test should pass as expected.
