The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should be returning `False` for identical blocks with different locations. It seems that the function is not properly comparing the blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples is done correctly. This can be achieved by comparing the blocks individually, and not as part of a tuple. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function for sorting the blocks can be refined to accurately determine block order based on type and locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version includes individual comparisons of the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, and refines the `canonicalize` function to accurately determine block order based on type and locations. These changes should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
