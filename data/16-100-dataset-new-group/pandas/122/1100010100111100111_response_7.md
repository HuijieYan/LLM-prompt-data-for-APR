The bug in the `equals` function lies in incorrect comparison and sorting of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. This leads to the `equals` function returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The bug can be fixed by properly sorting and comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.squeeze())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version properly sorts and compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. It should now be able to pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
