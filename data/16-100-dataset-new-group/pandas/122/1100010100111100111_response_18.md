The buggy function `equals` is failing to correctly compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects, resulting in a false positive when the equality check is expected to return `False`. 

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` may not be correctly handling unconsolidated blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons and unexpected equality results.

Explanation of the bug:
The function `equals` is erroneously returning `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` objects, even when the blocks within the managers have different locations. This is due to the use of `sorted` to compare the blocks based on their type name and then `mgr_locs`. This sorting process may not handle unconsolidated blocks correctly, leading to incorrect comparisons and the wrong return value.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` correctly handles unconsolidated blocks. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks for equality should strictly check the equality between corresponding blocks in the two managers, taking into account their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the block's identity and the manager locations. This ensures that the comparison of unconsolidated blocks is handled correctly. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks for equality has been modified to use the block's identity for equality check, ensuring that unconsolidated blocks are compared correctly.
