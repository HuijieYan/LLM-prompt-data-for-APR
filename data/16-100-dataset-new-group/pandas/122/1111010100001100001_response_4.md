The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. It checks if the `axes` are equal and then iterates through the `blocks` to compare if they are equal.

The bug occurs because when sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, the `block.mgr_locs` attribute is not handled properly. This causes the comparison to fail even when the actual data within the blocks are the same.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to include the `mgr_locs` attribute properly to ensure that it effectively compares the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, `block.values` is included in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that the actual data within the blocks is considered when sorting and comparing the blocks. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function works correctly.
