Based on the information provided, the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` for the comparison of two DataFrames that should be unequal.

The problem occurs when comparing blocks within the DataFrames. The `equals` method checks the equality of the blocks but does not account for their ordering, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should sort the blocks based on their type name and location before comparing them. This will ensure that identical blocks in different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Sort blocks based on type name and location
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly identify unequal DataFrames, as demonstrated by the failing test case mentioned earlier.
