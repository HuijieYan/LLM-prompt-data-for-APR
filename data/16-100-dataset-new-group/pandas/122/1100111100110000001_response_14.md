The buggy function `equals` is not working as expected and is causing the AssertionError in the failing test. The purpose of the function is to compare the content of two DataFrames and return `True` if they are equal, otherwise `False`.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. Call to `self._consolidate_inplace()`
2. Sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function
3. Comparison of the sorted `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. It may be treating `df1` and `df2` as equal when they are not, potentially due to the incorrect sorting of blocks or inconsistent handling of data types.

A strategy for fixing the bug involves:
1. Ensuring that `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` are functioning correctly to consolidate the blocks within the DataFrame.
2. Reviewing the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent sorting to ensure it correctly accounts for differences in the DataFrames and their blocks, such as data types and ordering.
3. Checking the comparison logic to verify that it accurately determines whether the DataFrames are equal after the blocks have been sorted.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values._id, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now compares the block values by their unique identifiers and actual values. This ensures that the blocks are sorted correctly. Additionally, the comparison logic at the end now accurately compares the sorted blocks of the DataFrames for equality.
