## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. It seems to be related to the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. 

The `canonicalize` function is currently using the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of each block to create a tuple for sorting. However, the bug seems to occur when blocks have the same `dtype.name` but different `mgr_locs`. This causes the comparison to return `True` when it should be `False`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, I would modify the `canonicalize` function to also include the `block.values` in the tuple. This would differentiate between blocks with the same `dtype.name` but different `mgr_locs`, ensuring that they are correctly compared. 

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, I modified the `canonicalize` function to include `block.values.tolist()` in the tuple, ensuring that the comparison takes the block values into account. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and correctly compare the `BlockManager` instances.
