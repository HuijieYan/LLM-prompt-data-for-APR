The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the class and once inside the class. When the `equals` function is called, it uses the `canonicalize` function defined outside the class, which leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function inside the class should be used instead of the one defined outside the class. Additionally, the `as_array` attribute of `mgr_locs` should be accessed directly instead of calling `tolist()` on it.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
