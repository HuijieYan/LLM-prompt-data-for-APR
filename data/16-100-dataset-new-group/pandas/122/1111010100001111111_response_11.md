The bug in the function `equals` is causing it to return incorrectly. The function should compare two `BlockManager` instances and return `True` only if they have equal axes and blocks. However, the bug in the function implementation causes it to return an incorrect value when the blocks are identical but have different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the function `canonicalize` used for sorting the blocks is not considering the `mgr_locs` attribute, which results in the comparison of identical blocks with different locations as being the same.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should incorporate the `mgr_locs` attribute into the tuple that is used for sorting the blocks. By including `mgr_locs` in the sorting order, the function will correctly distinguish between blocks with identical content but different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function `equals`:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(),  # include mgr_locs for sorting
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `mgr_locs` attribute in the `canonicalize` function, the corrected version will correctly compare and distinguish between blocks with identical content but different locations, resolving the issue and providing the expected output.
