The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is causing an issue where `DataFrame.equals()` is returning True in cases of identical blocks with different locations. This is in contrast to the expected behavior, i.e., returning False.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparisons of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals()` method.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not successfully handling cases where identical blocks have different locations. This is causing the `equals()` method to incorrectly return True instead of False.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function can be modified to include the position of the blocks in addition to the type name, and then the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` can be compared using this modified `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block._blklocs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations, and the `equals()` method should return the expected False when the blocks have different locations.
