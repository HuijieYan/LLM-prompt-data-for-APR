The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison of two BlockManager objects. The function is supposed to check if two BlockManagers are equal, but it fails to do so in certain cases.

The issue is that the function is performing a comparison based on the order of the blocks, which can lead to incorrect results if the block order is different between the two BlockManagers, even if the content of the blocks is the same.

To fix the bug, we should redefine the equality comparison in a way that does not require the block order to be the same. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on a unique identifier for each block and then comparing the sorted lists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on a unique identifier for each block
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass. The comparison of the blocks is now based on a unique identifier for each block, rather than the order of the blocks.
