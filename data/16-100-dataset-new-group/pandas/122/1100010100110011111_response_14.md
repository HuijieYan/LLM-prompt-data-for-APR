The issue with the buggy function `equals` is that it does not correctly compare the two DataFrames and returns a wrong result. This is highlighted in the failing test, which expects the result of `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`, but it actually returns `True`.

The cause of the bug is likely that the function is not properly comparing the blocks within the DataFrames, leading to a false positive result.

To fix the bug, the function `equals` should be modified to correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames and return the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks within the DataFrames
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        self_block = self.blocks[i]
        other_block = other.blocks[i]
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
        
    return True
```

In this corrected version, the function loops through each block in `self.blocks` and compares it with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. If any blocks are not equal, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

This corrected version should now correctly compare the DataFrames and return the expected result for the failing test case.
