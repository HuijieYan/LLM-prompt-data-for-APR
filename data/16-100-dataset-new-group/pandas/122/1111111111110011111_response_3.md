To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue where the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The issue seems to be related to the way the blocks are being compared and the specific handling of different block locations. By improving the canonicalization process and ensuring that the comparison takes into account the block locations, we can resolve this issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the values of the blocks and their locations when creating the canonical representation. This ensures that blocks with identical values but different locations are not wrongly marked as equal.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and return the correct result, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
