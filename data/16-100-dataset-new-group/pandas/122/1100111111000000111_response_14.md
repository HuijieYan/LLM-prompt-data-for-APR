The bug in the equals function is causing it to return True when comparing identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect. 

The bug is likely caused by the failure to account for different block locations during the comparison. 

To fix the bug, the equals function should be updated to handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.__class__, block.values.__array_interface__["data"][0])
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function compares the class type and the memory location of the block values to account for different block locations.

This updated version of the equals function should now correctly compare identical blocks with different locations and return the appropriate result, thereby resolving the GitHub issue and passing the failing test.
