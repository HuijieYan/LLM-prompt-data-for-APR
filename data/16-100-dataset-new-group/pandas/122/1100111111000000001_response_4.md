## 1. Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module. It compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with columns in a different order and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`. This failing test indicates that the buggy function is not correctly handling the comparison of DataFrames with columns in different orders.

## 2. Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
- The comparison of axes might not be handling the case where columns are in a different order.
- The canonicalization of blocks might not correctly handle the different order of columns.

## 3. Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the buggy function not handling the scenario where the DataFrames have columns in a different order. The comparison logic does not account for the column order, leading to incorrect equality results.

## 4. Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` method should be modified to account for the different column orders in DataFrames. This can be achieved by reordering the blocks based on the sorted column order before comparing them.

## 5. Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(
        ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)
    ):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_order = [col for col in self.axes[1]]
    other_order = [col for col in other.axes[1]]

    if self_order != other_order:
        return False

    def get_block_order(bm):
        return tuple(bm.get_dtype_counts().index)  # Sort based on column order

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_order)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_order)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
