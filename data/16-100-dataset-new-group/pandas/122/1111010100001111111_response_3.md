## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `equals` method arises from the fact that the function does not correctly compare blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. When comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, the function simply compares the order of the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. However, this comparison does not guarantee the correct result, especially when the blocks have different locations but the same content.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks needs to be revised to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal. One possible strategy is to compare the actual values within the blocks instead of relying solely on the block order and locations.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class members)

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.__class__, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.__class__, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of blocks is adjusted to sort the blocks based on their class and locations before comparing their contents using the `equals` method. This ensures that the comparison accounts for identical blocks with different locations, providing the correct result as expected.
