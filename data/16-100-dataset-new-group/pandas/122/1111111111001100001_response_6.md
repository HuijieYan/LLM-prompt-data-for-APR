The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances `self` and `other` for equality. The function first checks if the number of axes in `self` and `other` are the same, and then compares each axis using the `equals` method. It then consolidates both `self` and `other` instances in place before comparing the blocks of data within them for equality.

The bug here is that the function `canonicalize` is defined twice, once within the class and once outside. This could lead to confusion and unintended behavior when the function is called.

The `equals` function then creates a canonicalized version of the blocks in `self` and `other` before comparing each pair for equality.

The bug occurs due to incorrect sorting of the blocks. This can lead to false negatives when comparing the blocks for equality, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, it is advised to remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function and ensure that the sorting of the blocks is performed correctly before the equality comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function and ensured that the sorting of the blocks is based on the dtype name and the slice to avoid false negatives when comparing for equality.
