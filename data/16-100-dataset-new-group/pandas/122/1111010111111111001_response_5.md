The bug in the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return incorrect results. The function is intended to compare two BlockManager instances, but it fails to compare the underlying data blocks correctly.

The main cause of the bug is the logic used to compare the blocks within the `equals` function. It does not properly take into account the data types and locations of the blocks, resulting in incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be modified to compare the blocks based on their data types and manager locations. This would ensure a proper comparison of the underlying data in the BlockManager instances.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, np.ascontiguousarray(block.values).view(np.byte))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` function sorts the blocks based on their values and then compares them using the `equals` method of each block. This ensures that the comparison considers the actual content of the blocks rather than their memory location or order, which was the issue with the original implementation.
