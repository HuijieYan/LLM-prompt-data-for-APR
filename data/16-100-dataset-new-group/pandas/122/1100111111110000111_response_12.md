The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. It does not account for the situation when identical blocks have different locations, which leads to the mismatch.

To fix the bug, we should update the `equals` method to consider the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the actual block data to account for different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the actual block data and listing their locations, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly handled. This updated version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.

After applying this change, the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` should pass without raising an assertion error.
