The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `DataFrame.equals` method to return `True` even when the dataframes contain identical blocks with different locations.

The issue was reported on GitHub with the description that the `equals` method should return `False` for the provided example but it wrongly returns `True`. The bug was identified in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, specifically in the logic that compares the blocks of two dataframes.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should compare the blocks in a way that considers the block locations and ensures that the comparison correctly identifies when the dataframes contain identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.transpose(), block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the `equals` method should correctly identify when two dataframes contain identical blocks with different locations and return `False` as expected. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
