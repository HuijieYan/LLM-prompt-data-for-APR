The bug in the function seems to stem from the sorting process not correctly identifying identical blocks with different locations. As a result, the `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` in cases where the blocks have different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting process correctly identifies identical blocks with different locations and returns the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in blocks]

    self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)

    return all(
        block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now return the correct result and the failing test should pass.
