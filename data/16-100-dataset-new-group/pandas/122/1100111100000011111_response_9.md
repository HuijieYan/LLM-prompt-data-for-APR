## Fixing the bug

The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with identical content but different locations. This causes the function to return `True` instead of the expected `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider the content of the blocks and not just their locations in memory.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_content = [block.make_block_same_class(block.values, block.items, block.ref_locs) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [block.make_block_same_class(block.values, block.items, block.ref_locs) for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we create new block objects with the same content but with different locations in memory. Then, we compare the content of the blocks to determine their equality.

This approach should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks' content, returning the expected result.

Please note that the `make_block_same_class` function is a hypothetical method name, and you should use the appropriate method from the `Block` class to create new blocks with the same content for comparison.
