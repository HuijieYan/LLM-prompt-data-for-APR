The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. It compares two instances of the `BlockManager` class and is meant to return `False` if they are not equal. However, there is a bug that causes it to incorrectly return `True` for instances with identical blocks but different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue #28839.

The cause of the bug is in the implementation of the `equals` function. It does not account for the locations of blocks, meaning that even if the block values are the same but their locations are different, the function incorrectly returns `True`. This can be seen in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` where two dataframes with the same values but different locations are incorrectly marked as equal.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function needs to take into account the locations of the blocks when comparing instances. One way to do this is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in its tuple. This will ensure that blocks with the same values but different locations are not mistakenly marked as equal.

Additionally, since the `canonicalize` function is defined both outside and inside the `BlockManager` class, the one outside the class should be removed as it does not seem to be used, and the one inside the class should be used for sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name, mgr_locs, and block values
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With the above correction, the `equals` function will now correctly consider the block locations when comparing instances of the `BlockManager` class. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
