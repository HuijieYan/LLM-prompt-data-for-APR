The buggy function is the `equals` method from the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The function compares the internal blocks of two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without checking for the equality of their lengths.
2. Sorting and comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their `dtype` and `mgr_locs`.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly identify differences in the block locations between the two `BlockManager` instances, resulting in a wrong comparison result when using the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately compare the block locations in addition to the dtype. The correction should ensure that the function takes into account the positions of the blocks when comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple containing the block's dtype and `mgr_locs`. This ensures a correct comparison of the blocks based on their data type and block locations. The `equals` method should now accurately compare the two `BlockManager` instances and provide the correct result.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes.
