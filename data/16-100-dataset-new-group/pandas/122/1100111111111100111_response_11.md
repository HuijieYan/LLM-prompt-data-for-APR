## Explanation
The issue arises from the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. It is failing to compare the two DataFrames correctly, leading to unexpected results in the test case.

The cause of the bug lies in the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. The method wrongly returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

The `canonicalize` function is being used to sort the blocks and then compare them. However, the `canonicalize` function is not correctly implemented.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `canonicalize` function should be modified to ensure that it accurately represents the contents of the blocks in order to correctly differentiate between them. Additionally, the comparison logic within the `equals` method should be thoroughly reviewed and revised to ensure correct comparison of the DataFrames.

## The corrected version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].index.equals(other_blocks[i].index):
            return False
        if not self_blocks[i].columns.equals(other_blocks[i].columns):
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(self_blocks[i].values, other_blocks[i].values):
            return False
    
    return True
```
