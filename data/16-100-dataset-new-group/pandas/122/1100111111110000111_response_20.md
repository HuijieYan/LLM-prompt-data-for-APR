## Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Check equality of axis
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate inplace for both self and other
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check equality of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a helper function to canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
    # Sort blocks using canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check equality of sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `equals` function first checks the equality of axes, then consolidates in place for both self and other, and finally checks the equality of blocks. The canonicalize function now uses the block values and mgr_locs to distinguish blocks with different locations. The corrected version ensures that the blocks are properly sorted and compared for equality, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue and fixing the failing test.
