The buggy function `equals` seems to be comparing two `BlockManager` objects to check for equality, first by comparing the axes and then by sorting and comparing the blocks. However, in the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`, the function does not return the expected value, resulting in an assertion error.

The bug is likely in the code that compares the actual blocks for equality, as the failing test demonstrates that for two different DataFrames, the `equals` function returns `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates that the output of `df1.equals(df2)` is `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The failing test output provides the following information:
- `assert True is False`: This shows that the actual result of `df1.equals(df2)` is `True`.
- `<bound method NDFrame.equals of ...>`: This indicates that the comparison method being called is `<bound method NDFrame.equals>`.
- The resulting DataFrame from the test: 
```
   a  b
0  1  s
1  2  d
```
```
   a  b
0  s  1
1  d  2
```
This discrepancy in the output data further confirms that the `equals` method is returning an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function correctly identifies the difference between the two DataFrames.

Based on the information provided, the corrected version of the function `equals` is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks for equality
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        block = self.blocks[i]
        oblock = other.blocks[i]
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through each block in `self.blocks` and compare it with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. If any of the blocks are not equal, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after the iteration. This approach should fix the bug and make the function return the correct results.
