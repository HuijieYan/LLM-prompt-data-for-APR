The bug in the equals function is causing it to return True instead of False for two dataframes that are not equal. The problem lies in the comparison of the blocks within the dataframes, which is leading to the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks is correct and that the function returns the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then block items
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function should produce the expected output and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
