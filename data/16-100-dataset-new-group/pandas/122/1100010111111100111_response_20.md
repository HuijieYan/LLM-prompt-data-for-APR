The cause of the bug:
The buggy function `equals` is not comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` correctly due to the way it is handling the blocks and block locations. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` highlights the issue where `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` should return `True`, but it is failing and returning `False`. This is evident from the error message `assert True is False` and the runtime values which show that the DataFrame blocks are being compared incorrectly.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error locations in the `equals` function are the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, and the comparison of the blocks using the `all` function. These operations are not comparing the data within the blocks as intended, resulting in an incorrect comparison.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to consider the actual data within the blocks while sorting the blocks. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks using the `all` function needs to compare the actual block values.

Now, here is the corrected version of the function `equals`:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare the sorted blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tobytes())
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on their actual values to consider the data within the blocks. Then, the comparison of the blocks is done using `np.array_equal` to accurately compare the block values. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
