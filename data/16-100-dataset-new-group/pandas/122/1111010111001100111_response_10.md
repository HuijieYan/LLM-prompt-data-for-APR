## Bug Analysis
The `equals` function is comparing the block locations of two BlockManagers. However, it's comparing them without consolidating them first, leading to a false positive result and causing the failing test.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `equals` function where the block locations are being compared without consolidation.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the failure to consolidate the blocks of `self` and `other` before comparing them, leading to an incorrect result in the comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to consolidate the blocks of both `self` and `other` before comparing them within the `equals` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, we have added the lines `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` before comparing the blocks. This will ensure that the blocks are consolidated before the comparison, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
