The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks. It fails to do so due to an issue with the sorting and comparison of the blocks.

Upon analysis, the bug is likely occurring in the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the `equals` function. Specifically, the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their data type and manager locations, but it fails to correctly handle unconsolidated blocks like Categorical blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to safely handle unconsolidated blocks, and then use this modified function to sort and compare the blocks in the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Correction for the buggy function

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, CategoricalBlock):
            # Handle Categorical blocks separately to compare categories and codes
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.categories, block.codes)

        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function correctly handles unconsolidated blocks like Categorical blocks, enabling the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks and pass the failing test.
