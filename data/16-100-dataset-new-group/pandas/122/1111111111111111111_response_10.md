The buggy function `equals` is not comparing two DataFrames correctly due to the block locations being unordered. This causes the function to incorrectly return True even when the DataFrames are not equal, leading to failing tests and an issue posted on GitHub.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `equals` function to properly compare the block locations of each DataFrame, ensuring that they are in the same order before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort the blocks based on the canonical representation
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version ensures that the block locations are ordered correctly based on a canonical representation, allowing the function to correctly compare two DataFrames.

With this correction, the failing test case should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
