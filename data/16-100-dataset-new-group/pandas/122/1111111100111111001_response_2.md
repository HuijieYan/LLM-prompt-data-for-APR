The bug in the 'equals' function is causing the failing test. The issue arises from the sorting of 'self_blocks' and 'other_blocks' using the 'canonicalize' function. The 'canonicalize' function is defined twice, and the one being used inside 'equals' does not belong to the 'BlockManager' class. To fix the bug, we need to use the correct 'canonicalize' function defined within the 'BlockManager' class.

Additionally, there are other issues such as sorting by block type and mgr_locs, but these issues cannot be addressed without further information on the intention behind the code. As a result, the suggested corrected version here only addresses the 'canonicalize' function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Using the correct canonicalize function from the same class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
By using the correct 'canonicalize' function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
