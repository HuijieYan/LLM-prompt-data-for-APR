## Fixing the Bug

The bug in the `equals` function occurs when comparing identical blocks with different locations, causing the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`. The issue is related to the order of the blocks, which should be canonicalized before comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks by canonicalizing their order before performing the equality check.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Canonicalize the order of blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will correctly compare identical blocks with different locations and return the expected results based on the block contents rather than their locations. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the `equals` function behaves as intended.
