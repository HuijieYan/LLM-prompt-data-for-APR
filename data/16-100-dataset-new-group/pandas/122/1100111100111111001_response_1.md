The bug in the given function is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once in the class and once outside the class. When the `canonicalize` function is called inside the `equals` function, it's picking up the wrong definition. This causes the comparison to fail since the blocks are not getting properly sorted.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the duplicate `canonicalize` function from the class scope and ensure that the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function is referencing the correct `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... other methods ...

    # a single definition of canonicalize within the class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return the expected results for the failing test case provided.
