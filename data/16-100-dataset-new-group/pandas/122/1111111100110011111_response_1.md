### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class and is used to determine if the content of two `BlockManager` instances are equal. However, the failing test is indicating that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, which is incorrect behavior. The issue on GitHub clearly outlines the expected output and the test that fails to produce it.

#### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison logic inside the function
2. The canonicalization of blocks for comparison

### Cause of the Bug
The bug likely lies in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function, where there may be incorrect condition checks or incorrect canonicalization of blocks. This causes the function to return `True` when it should return `False`, as seen in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The potential strategy for fixing the bug involves:
- Correcting the logic of the comparison
- Ensuring that the blocks are correctly canonicalized before comparison

### Corrected Version of the Function
Given the analysis and strategy, the corrected version of the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.make_block_same_type().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with the comparison logic and canonicalization, ensuring that it returns the correct boolean result for the comparison.
