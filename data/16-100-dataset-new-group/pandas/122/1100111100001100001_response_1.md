The bug in the given function is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice with different input signatures and is not correctly called within the `equals` function. The correct `canonicalize` function should be called using `self`, and the `canonicalize` function that is called with a single argument should be removed to avoid confusion.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice with different input signatures, causing confusion in calling the correct function within the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, the duplicated `canonicalize` function with a single argument should be removed, and the correct `canonicalize` function should be called using `self` as an argument.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Correctly call the canonicalize function using self
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
By removing the duplicated `canonicalize` function and calling the correct `canonicalize` function using `self`, the bug is fixed.
