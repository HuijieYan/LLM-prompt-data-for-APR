The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting algorithm used to compare the blocks. It appears that the function is not correctly sorting the blocks before comparing them, which leads to the incorrect assertion failure in the test case.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before the comparison. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to properly extract and combine the required information from the blocks, and then using the sorted information for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function to properly extract and combine required information
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    # sort the blocks based on the canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the updated `canonicalize` function to extract and combine the required information from the blocks, and then sorting the blocks based on this information, the bug in the `equals` function should be fixed. This should ensure that the comparison between the blocks is performed correctly, resolving the assertion failure in the test case.
