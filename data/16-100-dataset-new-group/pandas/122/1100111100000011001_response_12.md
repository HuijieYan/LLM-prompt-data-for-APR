The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in the `self` and `other` objects, as well as with the sorting of these blocks before the comparison. The function is not handling the comparison and sorting of blocks properly, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can update the function to correctly handle the comparison and sorting of blocks in the `self` and `other` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the `canonicalize` function to access the correct indexer for block locations, and we have modified the sorting of blocks using the updated `canonicalize` function. This should address the issues with block comparison and sorting, and the function should now return the expected results for the given test cases.
