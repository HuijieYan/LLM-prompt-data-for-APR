### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the incorrect sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. This sorting is based on the result of the `canonicalize` function, which in turn returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and its location. If the locations of identical blocks are different, the sorting based on the location will lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` needs to be based on a different criteria, possibly the dtype name only, as the location of the blocks is causing incorrect sorting.

### Updated Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort only based on dtype name
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
