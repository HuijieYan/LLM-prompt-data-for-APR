The bug in the `equals` function is caused by attempting to call the private method `_consolidate_inplace` on the `self` and `other` objects, which are not valid for the `BlockManager` class. This results in the failing test as the comparison of the two data frames using the `equals` function returns `True` instead of the expected `False`.

To fix the bug, the private method `_consolidate_inplace` should be removed from the `equals` function, and the sorting of the blocks should be based on the block placement instead of using the `dtype` attribute of the block.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def get_block_placement(block):
        return block.mgr_locs
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=get_block_placement)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=get_block_placement)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version of the function, it will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
