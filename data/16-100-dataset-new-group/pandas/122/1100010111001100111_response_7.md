## Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two BlockManagers for equality. However, the issue on GitHub states that the function incorrectly returns False for identical blocks with different locations.

The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values for the columns. It then checks if `df1` equals `df2`, expecting the result to be False.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function for Case 1, it appears that the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks may be causing the issue. The `block.mgr_locs` values for `self` and `other` may be causing identical blocks to be considered unequal, leading to the incorrect result.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on the `mgr_locs` attribute. This sorting may not consider identical blocks in different locations as equal, leading to incorrect results.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the sorting of blocks based on `mgr_locs` must be revised to ensure that identical blocks are considered equal even if they are in different locations.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if all blocks are equal regardless of location
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the sorting based on `mgr_locs` has been removed, and the equality check is performed directly on the blocks. This change ensures that identical blocks are considered equal, leading to the correct result for the failing test.
