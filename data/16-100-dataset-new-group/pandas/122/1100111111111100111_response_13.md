Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The bug causes the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion to return `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The bug appears to be in the canonicalization of blocks. The `canonicalize` function is intended to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. However, it seems to be incorrectly implemented, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to properly sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, the main `equals` function should then compare the sorted blocks to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._typ, tuple(block.mgr_locs.__iter__())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` class, ensuring that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion returns the expected result of `False`.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect return value of the `equals` function for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
