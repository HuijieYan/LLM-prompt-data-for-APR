The bug in the `equals` function is causing incorrect results when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. This is leading to a failure in the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test. The `equals` function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances and then compares the blocks.

The problem lies in comparing the blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, but it incorrectly uses `as_array` to convert `mgr_locs` to a list. This results in incorrect canonicalization and comparison of blocks.

To resolve the bug, the `canonicalize` function should use the `tolist()` method to convert `mgr_locs` to a list.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test should pass without any assertion errors.
