The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The function is used to determine if the calling `BlockManager` object is equal to another `BlockManager` object passed as an argument. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects and returns `True` if they are equal, `False` otherwise.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the `df1.equals(df2)` is failing, and the assertion error is being raised. This is because the `equals` method is not comparing the data in the DataFrames for equality but instead comparing the references to the DataFrames themselves, resulting in the unexpected assertion error.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should compare the data within the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects, rather than their references.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare the data in the blocks for equality
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.values.equals(oblock.values):
            return False

    return True
```
In the corrected version, the `equals` method first checks the axes for equality and then consolidates the internal data. After that, it iterates over the blocks of both `BlockManager` objects and compares the data within the blocks using the `equals` method of the block values. If at any point the data is not equal, the function returns `False`. If all checks pass, it returns `True`.
