The bug in the `equals` function arises from a mismatch in the block order when comparing two dataframes. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when the dataframes have identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the block order is consistent when comparing the two dataframes. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks using a canonicalization method that takes into account the block type and the block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue and ensures that the block order is consistent between the two dataframes before performing the comparison. By sorting the blocks based on their type and locations, the function can accurately determine whether the dataframes are equal.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug, and the failing test should now pass without any errors.
