The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing DataFrames containing identical blocks with different locations. 

Potential error locations include:
1. Comparison of lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Comparison of individual elements in `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
3. Sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on `canonicalize` function.
4. Building the tuple in the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not account for the scenario where identical blocks have different locations, leading to incorrect comparison results and the wrong return value. This issue is also evident in the failing test case, which expects the `equals` function to return `False` for two DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly account for scenarios where identical blocks have different locations. We may need to update the logic used to compare `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and adjust the sorting mechanism based on the `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The above correction addresses the issues identified in the buggy function. It now properly compares the axes of the DataFrames and addresses the scenario where identical blocks have different locations by using a modified `canonicalize` function. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
