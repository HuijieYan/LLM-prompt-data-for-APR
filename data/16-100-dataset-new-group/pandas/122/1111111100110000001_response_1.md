The buggy function is `equals` in the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are logically equal. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `equals` function returns `True` when it should return `False` for the given DataFrames `df1` and `df2`.

The cause of the bug is a logical error in the comparison logic of the `equals` function. It appears that the comparison is not taking into account the values of the DataFrames when checking for equality, resulting in an incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual content of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects and not just their references. We can achieve this by comparing the values of the blocks, rather than comparing their references.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().tolist(), block.index.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.get_values(), oblock.get_values()) and block.index.equals(oblock.index)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use the `get_values()` method to obtain the values of the blocks, and we compare the actual values as well as the indices of the blocks to determine their equality. This ensures that the content of the blocks is compared accurately.

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass.
