To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between the `self` and `other` objects takes into account the actual content of the blocks rather than their locations. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to create a unique identifier for each block based on its content, rather than its location. 

We can achieve this by creating a tuple that combines the dtype name with the actual values of the block, effectively canonicalizing the blocks based on their content.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the actual values of the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.values))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the content of the blocks in the `self` and `other` objects, and return the expected boolean result in accordance with the provided test case and the GitHub issue.
