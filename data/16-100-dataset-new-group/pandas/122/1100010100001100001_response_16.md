The issue with the buggy function seems to be with the sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function is attempting to sort the blocks using a `canonicalize` function, but the sorting logic might not be correctly handling the comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we can modify the sorting and comparison logic for `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` in the `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to handle sorting and comparison of blocks
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return tuple((block.values, block.mgr_locs) for block in blocks)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if all blocks are equal
    return all(
        (block.values.equals(oblock.values) and
         block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
- We've updated the `canonicalize` function to create a tuple of `(block.values, block.mgr_locs)` for each block.
- We sort `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the updated `canonicalize` function to ensure consistent comparison of the blocks.
- We then iterate through the sorted blocks and check if both values and mgr_locs are equal for each pair of blocks.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function properly compares the blocks and returns the correct result.
