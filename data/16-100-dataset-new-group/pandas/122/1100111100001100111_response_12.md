The bug in the given function is related to the inconsistency in comparing BlockManager objects. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the `equals` function wrongly returns True for identical blocks with different locations. The `equals` function in the BlockManager class uses sorting and comparison on the blocks attribute, leading to incorrect results.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of the blocks attribute in the `equals` function of the BlockManager class. The sorting of blocks based on the `canonicalize` function does not handle identical blocks with different locations correctly, leading to unexpected True returns in cases where the blocks are not actually equal.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on their actual content rather than their order. Adding additional logic to handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations is essential to resolve this issue.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on their content
    return all(block.equals(other.blocks[i]) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks))
```

By comparing the blocks based on their actual content rather than their order, the corrected `equals` function ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and resolves the bug in the `equals` function.
