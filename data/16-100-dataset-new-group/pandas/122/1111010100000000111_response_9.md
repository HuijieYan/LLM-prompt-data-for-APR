The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `DataFrame.equals()` method is returning `True` in cases where it should be returning `False`. This happens when two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.

The buggy function `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class is currently comparing the blocks of two DataFrames without taking into account the potential difference in their locations. This can lead to incorrect results being returned.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to take into account the potential difference in block locations when comparing the DataFrames.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version above, the `canonicalize` function now uses `tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array)` to capture the block locations as a tuple, ensuring that the comparison takes into account not just the block content, but also the location. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub where the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` when it should be returning `False`.
