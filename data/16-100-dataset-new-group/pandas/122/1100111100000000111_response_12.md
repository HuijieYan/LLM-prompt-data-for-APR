## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. The issue reported on GitHub states that the function returns `True` incorrectly when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic within the `equals` function.
2. The canonicalization of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. It appears that the function does not consider the difference in locations of identical blocks, leading to the incorrect result.

## Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the comparison logic to also consider the location of the blocks.
2. Update the canonicalization function to include location information.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Updated canonicalize function to include block location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function adds the block locations to the canonicalize function, ensuring that blocks with identical data but different locations are treated as unequal. This should address the bug reported on GitHub.
