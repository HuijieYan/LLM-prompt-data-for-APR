The buggy function `equals` is failing because it compares two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) with different values and returns `True` when it should return `False`. This is likely due to the sorting and comparing process within the function, which is not correctly analyzing the order and values of the data blocks.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the sorting and comparing process in the `equals` function to ensure that it accurately compares the data blocks of the two DataFrames and returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block._simple_new(other=None))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now accurately compare the data blocks between two DataFrames and return the correct result. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
