The buggy function is the `equals` method defined in the `BlockManager` class in the pandas/core/internals/managers.py file. This function is used to compare two instances of the BlockManager class and determine if they are equal. 

The issue reported on GitHub describes a scenario where the `equals` method returns True for two DataFrames that have identical blocks but with different locations. The expected behavior is for the `equals` method to return False in this case.

Upon inspecting the buggy function, it's evident that the problem lies in how the function determines the equality of the blocks. Specifically, the canonicalize function is used to sort the blocks using their type name and manager locations. The issue arises when the blocks have the same type name but different manager locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the logic for comparing blocks needs to be modified to consider the manager locations of the blocks. One way to address this is by utilizing the `mgr_locs` attribute of the Block class when sorting the blocks. By incorporating the manager locations into the canonicalize function, the `equals` method can accurately compare the blocks based on their content and locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    # Check if the axes are equal
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the BlockManagers
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Check if the number of blocks are equal
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks based on type name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.values.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks for equality
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function now uses the `mgr_locs` attribute to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This modification ensures that the `equals` method correctly handles cases where identical blocks have different locations, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
