The issue has occurred in the equals() method of the BlockManager class. The issue is that even if the blocks within the DataFrame are identical, the equals() method incorrectly returns True if the block locations are different. This behavior is not expected, and the test case provided in the GitHub issue fails because of this bug.

The cause of the bug is that the canonicalize function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparing them, does not take into account the block locations. As a result, even if the blocks within the DataFrames are identical, the method returns True if the block locations are different.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to include the block locations in the tuple used for sorting the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to include block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs,
                block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()) # Include block locations
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the modification in the canonicalize function to include block locations, the equals() method will now correctly compare the DataFrames and return False if the blocks are identical but have different locations. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test case.
