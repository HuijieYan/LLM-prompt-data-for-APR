The bug in the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is causing the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test to fail in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file. This bug was also reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The issue reported that when using the `equals` function with two identical DataFrames with different block locations, it was incorrectly returning True instead of False.

The cause of the bug is within the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparison. In cases where there are unconsolidated blocks (e.g., Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order, the sorting using `canonicalize` can lead to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to consider the comparison of block attributes for the specific type of blocks. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks should consider their original order before sorting to avoid incorrect results.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block.values, Categorical):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.codes.tolist(), block.values.categories.tolist())
        else:
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = [block for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block for block in other.blocks]

    #restore order
    self_blocks = [self.blocks[i] for i in range(len(self_blocks)) if i in [blk.mgr_locs.index for blk in self.blocks]]
    other_blocks = [other.blocks[i] for i in range(len(other_blocks)) if i in [blk.mgr_locs.index for blk in other.blocks]]

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include specific attribute comparison for different block types and restoring the order of the blocks after sorting, the bug in the `equals` function is corrected. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
