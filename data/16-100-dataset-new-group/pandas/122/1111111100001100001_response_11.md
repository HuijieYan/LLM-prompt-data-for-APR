The bug in the given function is likely to be caused by the sorting of the blocks and comparing them using the `equals` method. The usage of the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks and compare them based on type and location might be causing the issue.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to make sure that the sorting and comparison of the blocks is accurate and does not result in any false negatives.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
        
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the comparison of axes has been simplified by combining the checks for length inequality and element-wise inequality. The sorting and canonicalizing of the blocks have been removed as they were not necessary for the comparison. Each block is directly compared using the `equals` method, and the function returns `True` only if all comparisons are `True`.
