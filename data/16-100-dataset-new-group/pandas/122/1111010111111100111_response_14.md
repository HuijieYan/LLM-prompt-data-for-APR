### Explanation:
The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking if they have the same axes and blocks. However, it fails to handle the case where the blocks are identical but differ in location. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with the same content but different block locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `equals` function not properly considering the block locations when comparing the two `BlockManager` instances. This results in the incorrect evaluation of DataFrame equality.

### Potential Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly consider block locations when comparing blocks between `BlockManager` instances. We should ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account the block's content and its location within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) and block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This modified version compares both the content and the location of the blocks to correctly determine equality between the two `BlockManager` instances. This should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function return the expected result.
