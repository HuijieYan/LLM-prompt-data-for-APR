## Analysis
The `equals` function is intended to compare two pandas objects for equality. The function seems to be comparing the axes and blocks of the two objects to determine if they are equal.

## Potential Error
The bug may be located in the `canonicalize` function or in the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the comparison in the `canonicalize` function, or the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, which fails to correctly determine the equality of the two pandas objects.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic correctly handles the equality of the pandas objects and returns the appropriate result.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I modified the `canonicalize` function to use the `dtypes` attribute instead of `dtype.name` and also included the comparison of the block values to ensure correct equality comparison.
