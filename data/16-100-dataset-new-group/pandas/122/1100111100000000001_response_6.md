The bug in the provided function is related to the `canonicalize` function. There are two `canonicalize` functions defined, one within the `BlockManager` class and another outside of the class. The one defined within the class is not being used in the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class is being used in the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # using the canonicalize function within the class
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # corrected the function call
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function within the class is used by calling it as `canonicalize(block)` instead of the external one. Additionally, the function call `block.mgr_locs.as_array()` has been corrected to `block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()`.
