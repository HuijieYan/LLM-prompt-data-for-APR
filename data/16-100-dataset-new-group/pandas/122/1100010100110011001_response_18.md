The cause of the bug is that the function is not comparing the data frames correctly, leading to the assert statement in the test failing. This is likely due to the incorrect comparison logic in the equals function. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the equals function to compare the data frames properly, taking into account the index and column values. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]) for i in range(len(self_axes))):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```

With the corrected version, the function should now compare the data frames correctly and pass the failing test.
