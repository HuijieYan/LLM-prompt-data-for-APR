The bug in the `equals` function causes the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test to fail. The error message indicates that `True` is returned instead of `False`, demonstrating that the function does not correctly identify the DataFrames as unequal.

Examining the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, especially the `self` and `other` variables, reveals that the issue might be related to the comparison of blocks within DataFrames. The `canonicalize` function is responsible for ordering the blocks, and the incorrect order might lead to the function wrongly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different positions.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be fixed to correctly order the blocks based on their content, and the comparison logic should be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.get_values())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
