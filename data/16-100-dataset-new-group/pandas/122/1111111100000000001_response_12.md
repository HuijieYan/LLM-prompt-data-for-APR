Given the buggy function provided, here is a corrected version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # corrected the function call
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
The main bug in the provided function is the incorrect function call to `as_array` and `mgr_locs` which in the line `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which results in an AttributeError. This is because `as_array` and `mgr_locs` are not attributes of the `block` object. To fix this, we need to fix the call to `as_array` method, and correct the use of the `mgr_locs` attribute which requires a function call.

The corrected version of the function above correctly calls `as_array()` method and uses `mgr_locs` attribute with the correct function call.

Apart from that, we must ensure that the as_array, mgr_locs, and block.equals method calls are valid based on the documentation and ensure that the logic to compare the blocks and the axes is accurate based on the expected behavior mentioned in the related class documentation.

Additionally, make sure to test the corrected function with valid data to ensure that the bug has been fixed and the function behaves as expected.
