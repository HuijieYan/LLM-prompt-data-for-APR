Based on the provided information, the buggy function `equals()` is incorrectly returning `True` in cases where the DataFrame `df1` and `df2` are not equal but have identical blocks with different locations. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing with the message `assert True is False`.

The source of the bug is within the `equals()` function itself. The function compares the DataFrame `self` with another DataFrame `other` and should return `False` if they are not equal. However, the comparison logic does not account for identical blocks with different locations, resulting in the erroneous `True` value being returned.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals()` function to properly compare the blocks of the two DataFrames, taking into account their location and order.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Use tuples of blocks and their positions for comparison
    self_block_positions = list(enumerate(self.blocks))
    other_block_positions = list(enumerate(other.blocks))

    return self_block_positions == other_block_positions
```

With this modification, the `equals()` function will properly compare the blocks of the two DataFrames, accounting for their positions and order.

The corrected version of the `equals()` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
