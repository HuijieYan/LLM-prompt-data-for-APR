The buggy function, `equals(self, other)`, attempts to compare two BlockManager instances to check whether they are equal. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is failing with the error message `assert True is False`. This failure occurs because the function incorrectly returns `True` for the comparison of unequal DataFrame instances.

The potential cause of the bug is likely related to the block sorting and comparison logic inside the `equals` function. It appears that the sorting logic and comparison of blocks are not correctly handling the different orders of the blocks in the two BlockManager instances, resulting in an incorrect equality comparison.

To fix the bug, the sorting and comparison logic for blocks needs to be revised to accurately determine the equality of the two BlockManager instances.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by column labels to handle different block orders
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: block.items)

    self_blocks = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = sort_blocks(other.blocks)

    # Compare sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The updated logic includes sorting the blocks by their column labels and then comparing the sorted block lists for equality, which results in a correct determination of the BlockManager instances' equality.
