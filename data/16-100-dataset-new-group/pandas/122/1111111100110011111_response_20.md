### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal. The function first checks if the dimensions of the two axes are equal, and if not, returns `False`. Then, it checks if the axes themselves are equal and consolidates the two objects. After that, it compares the blocks in the two objects and returns `True` only if all the blocks are equal.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed. This means that the `equals` method returned `True` when it was expected to return `False`.

The expected input/output values for the failing test case are provided, which indicates the current state of the variables during the function execution. 

The GitHub issue is related to the bug in the `equals` method. The detailed description of the issue suggests that the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug cause
The bug is likely related to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method. The comparison of blocks may not be considering the block locations, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by adjusting the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method to account for block locations. This may involve modifying the `canonicalize` function or adjusting the comparison logic for blocks.

### Corrected version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been renamed to `canonicalize_block` and now uses `block.mgr_locs.indexer` to account for block locations in the comparison. Additionally, the comparison of blocks has been updated to use `zip` to iterate over the sorted blocks and check for equality. This should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result for the failing test case.
