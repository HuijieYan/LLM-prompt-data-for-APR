The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two BlockManager objects for equality, but it fails to do so, causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The issue on GitHub describes the problem as `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The bug seems to be in the part of the function that compares the blocks within the BlockManager objects. The comparison relies on a sorting function `canonicalize` that sorts the blocks based on data type and location, but it seems that this sorting logic is causing incorrect results, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic of comparing and sorting the blocks to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly recognized as not equal. We will modify the block comparison logic to only compare the values within the blocks, disregarding their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_values = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_values = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_block, other_block) 
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self_values, other_values)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we compare the values within the blocks using `np.array_equal` to ensure that the equality is based solely on the content of the blocks, ignoring their locations. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function behave as expected.

Once this corrected function is implemented, it should address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
