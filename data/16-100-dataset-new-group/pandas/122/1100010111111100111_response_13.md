Based on the given information, the bug in the `equals` function is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail. The error message indicates that `assert True is False`, which implies that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False`. This issue is documented in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The problem in the `equals` function is likely related to the comparison of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function attempts to canonicalize the block order using a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`. However, it appears that the comparison logic within the `equals` function is not accounting for the correct block order, which leads to a false positive result.

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` needs to be updated to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the values of the block in addition to `mgr_locs`. This change ensures that blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are compared appropriately, taking into consideration both type and value.

With this correction, the `df1.equals(df2)` test is expected to return the correct result of `False`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
