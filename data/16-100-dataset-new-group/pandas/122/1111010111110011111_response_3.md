## Analysis
The `equals` function is designed to check if two BlockManager objects are equal. The main issue is that it is not properly handling the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager. This is causing the function to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the block locations are different but the blocks themselves are identical. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is failing because of this bug.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle comparing blocks with different locations. The sorting of blocks by `canonicalize` does not account for the actual block values, only their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks within the BlockManager. Instead of just comparing block locations and data types, we should compare the actual block values as well.

## Updated Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks directly
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version of the `equals` function, we directly compare the blocks within the BlockManager using the `equals` method of the block class. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account the block values as well as their locations and data types. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the expected result.
