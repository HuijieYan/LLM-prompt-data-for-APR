The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two BlockManagers to check if they are equal. However, the current implementation is not correctly comparing the two BlockManagers, resulting in incorrect output.

The potential error in the function can be identified in the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` may not be properly comparing the blocks for equality.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function does not adequately represent the unique properties of each block, leading to incorrect comparison results. This causes the function to return incorrect results, failing the test cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to use a combination of properties unique to each block for comparison. This can involve comparing properties such as dtype, shape, and data values within the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block for equality
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
        
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we loop through each block in `self.blocks` and compare it to the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. We use the `equals` method of each block to determine if they are equal. If any pair of blocks is not equal, we return False. Otherwise, if all blocks are equal, we return True. This ensures that all blocks are compared for equality, addressing the original bug.
