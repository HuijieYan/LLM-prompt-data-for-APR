### Analysis:
1. The function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file in the `pandas` library is buggy, as it's not comparing the values of the blocks correctly, leading to incorrect results.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False` for two DataFrames with different values.
3. The GitHub issue confirms that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Identification of potential error location:
The potential error is likely in the portion where the function is comparing blocks using the `equals` method, and in the block canonicalization process using the `canonicalize` function.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `equals` method incorrectly returning `True` when the data blocks have different locations in memory, meaning that identical blocks with different locations are being treated as equal.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the `equals` method to correctly compare the values in the blocks rather than their memory locations. Additionally, the canonicalization process should consider the actual values of the blocks rather than just their type and location.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
The correction involves updating the `canonicalize` function to include the values of the block in the tuple, and using these tuples for comparison. This will ensure that blocks with identical values but different locations in memory are properly considered equal.

With this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the values of the blocks and return `True` only if the DataFrames have the same values in corresponding cells, regardless of their memory locations. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and make the comparison consistent with the user's expectations.
