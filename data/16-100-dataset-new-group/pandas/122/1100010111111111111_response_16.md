The bug in the `equals` function occurs because it does not correctly handle the comparison between DataFrames when the blocks are identical but have different locations. This results in `df1.equals(df2)` incorrectly evaluating to `True` instead of the expected `False`.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to consider both block contents and locations. Additionally, the comparison of blocks should be altered to evaluate the equality while considering both block values and locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version accounts for both block contents and locations in the `canonicalize` function and ensures that block equality is compared taking both factors into consideration.

This fix should resolve the reported issue on GitHub and pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
