The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to not pass. The test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` given the dataframes `df1` and `df2`. However, the current implementation of the `equals` method is not correctly identifying the differences between the two dataframe blocks, leading to an incorrect return value.

The potential error locations within the `equals` method include:
- The comparison of the `self.axes` and `other.axes` may not be handling the comparison of the axis labels correctly.
- The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may be causing an incorrect order in the comparison, leading to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug in the `equals` method is that it is not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. As a result, when the method should return `False` due to differences in the dataframes, it is erroneously returning `True`, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the axes and the sorting of the blocks need to be revised to ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the differences between the two `BlockManager` instances.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(
        ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)
    ):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the comparison of the axes and the sorting of the blocks accurately reflect the differences between the two `BlockManager` instances, and the failing test should now pass.
