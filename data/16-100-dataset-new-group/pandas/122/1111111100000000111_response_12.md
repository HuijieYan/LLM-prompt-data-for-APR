The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to incorrectly return `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue. 

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. Comparison of the length of `self.axes` and `other.axes`.
2. Sorting and comparing of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on an incorrect canonicalization function.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of block equality is not performed accurately. The function attempts to canonicalize the block order using the `canonicalize` function, which does not account for the identical blocks with different locations, leading to the incorrect True result.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for comparing the blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of relying on sorting and canonicalization, we should compare the blocks directly to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are also considered as unequal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly
    for block_label in self.blocks:
        if block_label not in other.blocks:
            return False
        if not self.blocks[block_label].equals(other.blocks[block_label]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we directly compare the blocks from `self` with the corresponding blocks in `other`. If any block is not present in `other` or if the corresponding blocks are not equal, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True after checking all the blocks. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
