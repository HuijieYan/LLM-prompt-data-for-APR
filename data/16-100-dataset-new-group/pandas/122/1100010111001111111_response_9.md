The bug in the `equals` function is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail. Based on the provided information, we can identify a potential error location within the buggy function, which is the sorting of the blocks using `canonicalize`. It seems that this sorting is not correctly identifying the differences in block locations.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we should update the `canonicalize` function to properly consider block locations when comparing the blocks. We can do this by including the block's location as a criterion in the sorting logic.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function to include block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this update, the `equals` function should now correctly consider block locations when comparing the blocks, and it should pass the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
