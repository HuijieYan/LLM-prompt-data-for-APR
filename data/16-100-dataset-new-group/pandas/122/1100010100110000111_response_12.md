## Analysis:
The `equals` function is not correctly comparing the input DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, leading to a failed assertion in the test. This is due to a sorting issue with the internal blocks of the DataFrames that causes the equality check to return `True` instead of `False`.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the `equals` method returns `True` when it should return `False` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

## Potential Error Location:
The issue might be in the sorting of internal block data using the `canonicalize` function and the comparison of the sorted blocks using `equals`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect behavior of the `equals` function when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks at different locations. The sorting logic used in the `canonicalize` function does not adequately handle this case, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting logic and comparison in the `equals` function. It should consider the identical blocks at different locations as not equal. Additionally, we need to ensure that the equality check on DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations returns `False`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # combine the type name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, hash(block.to_string()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function now ensures that DataFrames with identical blocks at different locations are considered not equal, as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
