Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function seems to stem from the way blocks are being compared and ordered. The use of `canonicalize` and sorting blocks based on their location is causing the function to return True incorrectly.

To fix this bug, the sorting of blocks should be based on a different criterion, such as the block's content. Additionally, the comparison between the blocks should be adjusted to ensure that the function correctly identifies when the blocks are not equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def sorting_key(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sorting_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sorting_key)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `sorting_key` function is used to sort blocks based on their content. The comparison now relies on the content of the blocks rather than their locations, ensuring that the function correctly identifies when the blocks are not equal.

By making these changes, the `equals` function should now return the correct result based on the content of the blocks, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
