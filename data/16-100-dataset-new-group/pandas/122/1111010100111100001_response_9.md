From the error message and the input/output values provided, it appears that the bug is related to the comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function. The error message indicates that the comparison of the two DataFrames is returning `True` instead of `False`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and the manager locations. However, there might be an issue with the comparison logic when checking equality between blocks, causing the function to return `True` incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done correctly. One way to do this is to enhance the comparison logic within the `equals` function, particularly when comparing the blocks using the `canonicalize` function and the `all` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name, tuple(block.get_values()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, we have enhanced the `canonicalize` function to include the values of the block in the tuple, ensuring that the comparison considers both type name, manager locations, and values. Additionally, the comparison using the `all` function now includes equality comparison of the blocks using `equals` method.

With these modifications, the corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test.
