The cause of the bug in the equals function seems to be related to how the block data is being compared and sorted. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates that when comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2`, the buggy equals function is incorrectly returning True instead of False.

To fix the bug, we can revise the logic within the equals function to properly compare the blocks in the dataframes. We need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.nbytes, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the `canonicalize` function to use `block.values.nbytes` and `block.values` to properly sort the blocks. This ensures that the blocks are compared based on their values and not their types.

With this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass.
