The potential error locations within the buggy function may include:
1. Incorrect comparison of axes lengths, potentially causing the function to return False incorrectly.
2. Sorting and comparing blocks based on their type name and manager locations, which may not be a reliable method for determining block equality.

The cause of the bug is related to the faulty comparison and sorting of blocks within the `equals` function. It seems to be incorrectly comparing the data in the blocks, leading to the erroneous return value in the failing test.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve revising how the blocks are compared and sorted. It might also involve ensuring that the function properly compares the data within the blocks rather than just their types and locations.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks based on data values rather than type name and manager location
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version includes direct comparison of blocks' data values rather than relying on their type names and manager locations. This should ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result.
