The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The purpose of this function is to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.

The error message from the failing test is indicating that the comparison `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is unexpected.

The cause of the bug can be identified in the `equals` function. The function first compares the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, returning `False` if they are not equal. Then, it compares each axis in a loop, and if any pair of axes are not equal, it returns `False`. After this, the function attempts to consolidate the objects in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method, which could potentially modify the objects unexpectedly. Following this, the function compares the number of blocks in the two objects, and if they are not equal, it returns `False`.

Then the function proceeds to sort the blocks in the `self` and `other` objects using the `canonicalize` function, which is defined both in the global scope and within the `BlockManager` class. This is likely to cause confusion and result in unpredicted behavior.

Finally, the function iterates over the sorted blocks and checks for equality using the `equals` method for each pair of blocks. However, the previous steps have already made it difficult to accurately compare the blocks.

To fix this bug, we can start by ensuring that the `canonicalize` function is defined only once and is unambiguous. We can remove the duplicate definition of `canonicalize` within the `BlockManager` class. Additionally, the `_consolidate_inplace` method should not be called within the `equals` function as it modifies the object and can lead to unexpected results.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the call to `_consolidate_inplace` and ensured that `canonicalize` is defined once and is unambiguous. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected.
