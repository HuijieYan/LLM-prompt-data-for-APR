The issue in the `equals` function is likely caused by the sorting method used on `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without taking into account the different locations of identical blocks. This causes the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when it encounters identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include both the block's data type and its data location in the `mgr_locs` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block's `mgr_locs`, the function now correctly handles identical blocks with different locations and ensures that the `equals` method returns the expected result.

This fix should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the failing test now passes.
