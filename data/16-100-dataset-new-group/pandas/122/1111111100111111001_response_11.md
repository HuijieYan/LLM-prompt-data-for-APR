The bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class is causing the test to fail. The bug occurs when comparing two DataFrames using the equals method. The bug causes the method to return True when it should return False.

The bug is likely due to the comparison logic present in the equals method. It compares the axes, the block contents, and the block order, but the comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic accurately checks for equality between the two instances of BlockManager.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.axes != other.axes:
        return False

    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected approach compares the axes directly and then iterates through the blocks, checking for equality between each corresponding block in self and other. This ensures that the comparison is done accurately and delivers the expected results.
