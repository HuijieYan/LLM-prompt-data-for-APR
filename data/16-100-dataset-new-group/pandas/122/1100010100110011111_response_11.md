The buggy function `equals` is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two dataframes with identical blocks but different locations. This is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, and the comparison of individual blocks within the dataframes.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly returns `True` when blocks with different locations are compared and sorted. This behavior does not align with the expected output of `False` in the provided GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the comparison and sorting of blocks with different locations, ensuring that the function returns `False` when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the function properly compares and sorts the blocks, ensuring that it returns `False` when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
