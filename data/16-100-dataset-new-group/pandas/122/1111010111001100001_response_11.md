The buggy function "equals" in class "BlockManager" is comparing two instances of BlockManager to check if they are equal. It is failing because the comparison logic is incorrect, as seen in the failing test.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison logic for self_axes and other_axes
2. Mistaken comparison logic for self.blocks and other.blocks
3. The canonicalization of block order might not be working as expected

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic is not correctly taking into account the axes and blocks for equality comparison. This results in the function returning incorrect results, causing the failing test case.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be revisited and validated against the expected behavior. Proper canonicalization of block order should be implemented to ensure correct ordering and comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = [(ax.name, ax) for ax in self.axes]
    other_axes = [(ax.name, ax) for ax in other.axes]
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if ax1 != ax2:
            return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice()))
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
