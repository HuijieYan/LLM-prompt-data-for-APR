The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should return `False`.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the implementation of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function. This `canonicalize` function sorts and compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`, but it may not be robust enough to handle the comparison of two DataFrames with the same values in different column orders.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to accurately compare the blocks, taking into account the order of the values within the blocks as well.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function uses `block.get_values()` to obtain the values within the block, and then sorts and compares the blocks based on these values and their locations.

This change ensures that the comparison between two DataFrames with the same values but in different column orders will result in the expected `False` outcome.

After making this change, the `equals` function should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
