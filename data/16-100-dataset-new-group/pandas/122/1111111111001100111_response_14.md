The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return incorrect results. The issue reported on GitHub describes a case where `df3.equals(df4)` should return False, but it is returning True instead.

Upon analyzing the values and types of input parameters and variables inside the function, it is observed that `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are tuples of block objects, and the comparison of blocks is resulting in a wrong output.

The cause of the bug is that the equality comparison `self.blocks.equals(other.blocks)` is not correctly identifying the differences in the block locations, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison logic to explicitly compare the contents of the blocks by comparing their `mgr_locs` attribute, which represents the locations of the blocks. By making this comparison explicit, we can ensure that the comparison considers the actual content of the blocks rather than just the blocks themselves.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare the block contents based on mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `equals` function should now return the correct result for the given test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
