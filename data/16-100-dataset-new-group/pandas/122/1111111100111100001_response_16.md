The bug in the equals function is causing the failing test. The function is comparing two BlockManager objects, self and other, to check if they are equal. However, the function contains some issues that lead to incorrect comparisons.

The buggy function has a logical error in its comparison of the BlockManager objects. It only checks if the lengths of the axes are the same and then proceeds to sort and compare the blocks. However, there are additional checks needed to ensure that the ObjectBlocks and IntBlocks are being compared correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure that each block type (IntBlock, ObjectBlock, etc.) is being compared separately. This might involve iterating over the blocks and comparing them individually based on their types.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Check if the axes are equal
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    # Compare the length of the blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Iterate over the blocks and compare them based on types
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if type(self_blocks[i]) != type(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the equals function should now pass the failing test. It properly compares the axes and then iterates over the blocks to compare them based on their types. This should resolve the logical errors present in the original function.
