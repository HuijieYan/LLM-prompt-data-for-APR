The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The current sorting logic might not be correct or might be interacting with the `canonicalize` function in an unexpected way, leading to a failed test case.

To fix the bug, we should first ensure that the ordering and sorting of the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is correct. Then we should also verify that the `canonicalize` function is correctly transforming the blocks to be used for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring that the sorting and comparison steps are done correctly, this updated function should pass the failing test case and produce the expected output.
