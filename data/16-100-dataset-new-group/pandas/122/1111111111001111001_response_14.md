The bug in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function. The canonicalize function is defined in two places, once within the `BlockManager` class and once outside the class. When the `equals` function tries to sort the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, it always uses the one defined outside the class, which might lead to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function is used from within the `BlockManager` class.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is now defined within the `BlockManager` class to ensure that it is used correctly within the `equals` function. This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test case passes.
