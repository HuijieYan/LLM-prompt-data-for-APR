## The corrected version of the equals function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):  # Add this line to check if 'other' is of the same type as 'self'
        return False
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `managers.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function could be the comparison of different types of dataframes, as well as the sorting mechanism of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.
3. The bug in the original function was caused by not checking if 'other' is of the same type as 'self', leading to the incorrect determination of inequality between different types of objects.
4. To fix the bug, we can add a line to check if 'other' is of the same type as 'self' before proceeding with the comparison. Additionally, the canonicalize function should use block._values instead of block.dtype.name to properly distinguish the blocks for comparison.
5. The corrected version of the equals function is provided above. This version includes the additional check for the type of 'other' and uses block._values for canonicalization to pass the failing test.
