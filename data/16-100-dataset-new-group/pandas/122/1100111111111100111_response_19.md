## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal. However, it incorrectly compares the `blocks` attribute of the two `BlockManager` objects by sorting them using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple using the block's type name and manager locations, which may not accurately represent the equality of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects directly, without relying on the sorting and `canonicalize` function. This can be achieved by iterating through the blocks and comparing them one by one.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the sorting and `canonicalize` function have been removed, and the direct comparison of the blocks has been implemented. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects.
