The bug in the function "equals" is caused by the canonicalization of blocks sorting the blocks, which leads to incorrect comparisons between the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalization function accurately represents the blocks for comparison and sorting. We can achieve this by modifying the "canonicalize" function to return the block's data type, itself, and its location, instead of just the data type and location. This will provide a unique representation for each block, allowing for accurate sorting and comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function modifies the "canonicalize" function to return a tuple containing the block type, data type, and location information. This will provide a unique representation for each block, ensuring accurate sorting and comparison.
