The bug in the `equals` function causes it to falsely return `True` even when the blocks have different locations. The issue on GitHub indicates that the expected output for the failing test case should be `False`.

The potential sources of error in the `equals` function are the comparison of block locations and the sorting of blocks based on data type and locations.

The root cause of the bug is the incorrect sorting of blocks based on location and data type. This leads to a situation where similar blocks with different locations are considered equal.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block locations are properly considered when comparing the blocks. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to also include block locations for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including `block.values.tolist()` in the tuple used for comparison, we ensure that the block locations are properly considered. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected results for the failing test case.
