The bug in the provided code is due to the incorrect behavior of the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. When comparing the equality of two dataframes, the `equals` function is not returning the correct result for the given input dataframes. This is because the function is not properly handling the comparison of the dataframe blocks, leading to incorrect equality assessment.

The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the function correctly compares the blocks of the dataframes and returns the appropriate equality result. This involves properly sorting and comparing the blocks of the dataframes to accurately determine their equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype, id(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now return the correct result for comparing the equality of the dataframes.

If the corrected function is placed in the appropriate class and the test function is run again, it should pass without triggering the AssertionError.
