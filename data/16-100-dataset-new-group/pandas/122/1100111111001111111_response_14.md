The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to wrongly return `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations. This issue is important to address as it affects the accuracy of the DataFrame comparison.

The bug is located in the `equals` function where it attempts to compare two DataFrames by checking if the axes are equal, then consolidating the blocks in place, and finally comparing the blocks one by one. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the sorting mechanism used for the blocks, which may not consider all relevant aspects when determining equality.

To fix this bug, a possible strategy would be to improve the canonicalization of blocks by considering all relevant factors for determining equality. This could involve redefining the `canonicalize` function in a way that accurately captures the distinguishing features of the blocks for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.mgr_locs,
            block.values,
            block._simple_new(block.values, placement=block.mgr_locs).dtype,
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function aims to improve the canonicalization of blocks by considering the block locations, values, and data types. This should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.
