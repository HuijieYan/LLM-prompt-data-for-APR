The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager instances for equality. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates that the function is not working as expected.

From the error message, it is clear that the function is returning True instead of False when called with the test input.

Analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it is evident that the function is not handling the comparison correctly. The comparison is based on the content of the BlockManager instances, which include axes and blocks. The sorting and comparison process is causing the function to return True incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting and comparison process takes into account the content of the BlockManager instances correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort and compare blocks based on content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on the content of the blocks using a lambda function and the `get_values` method. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the actual content of the blocks rather than their type or order. This should resolve the bug and make the function return the correct result for the failing test case.
