### Analysis
The failing test is checking whether `df1.equals(df2)` returns False, but the test is failing with an AssertionError because the actual result is True. This means that the `equals` function is returning the wrong result.

Upon examining the code and the failing test, it appears that the `equals` function is not properly comparing the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`. This leads to the incorrect comparison result.

The GitHub issue confirms the problem and provides a simple test case where the `equals` function is expected to return False, but it is returning True instead.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` objects. This results in the function returning True for cases where the internal blocks have the same data but are located in different parts of the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by modifying the `canonicalize` function to properly compare and order the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` objects. This will ensure that the comparison of the internal blocks is done correctly, leading to the correct result from the `equals` function.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other code...

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # modified canonicalize function to properly compare internal blocks
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block, block.values)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
``` 

With this correction, the `equals` function will effectively compare the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` objects, leading to the correct comparison result.
