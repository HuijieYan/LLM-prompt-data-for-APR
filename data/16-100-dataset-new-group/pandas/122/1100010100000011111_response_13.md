## Correction
The bug in the equals function exists because the ordering of blocks is not being considered when checking for equality. This leads to cases where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly evaluated as equal.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to consider the block's ordering.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function now considers the block's ordering by including the mgr_locs as an array without converting it to a list, improving the comparison logic.

This correction will resolve the issue reported on GitHub, and the equals() method will now correctly evaluate the equality of DataFrame blocks, taking into account their positions.
