The bug in the equals function is causing the failing test. The issue arises when comparing the two DataFrames. The failing test compares two DataFrames, df1 and df2, and checks if they are equal using the equals method. However, the buggy code within the equals method results in an incorrect assertion, causing the test to fail.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the axes of self and other using the `equals` method.
2. The comparison of blocks within self and other using the `equals` method.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly compare the axes and blocks of the two BlockManager instances, self and other. The buggy implementation results in a false assertion, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the comparison of axes and blocks needs to be updated to ensure accurate equality comparisons.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        (block.values == oblock.values).all() for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version improves the block comparison by directly comparing the values of the blocks using the `==` operator followed by the `all()` method to check if all values are equal.

After applying the corrected version of the function, the failing test should pass successfully.
