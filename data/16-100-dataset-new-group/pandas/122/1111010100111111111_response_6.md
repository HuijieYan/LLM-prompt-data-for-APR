Based on the provided information, it appears that the equals function is not working as expected and is returning True when it should be False. This is evident from the failing test where df1.equals(df2) is expected to be False but returns True.

The bug seems to occur when comparing the blocks within the BlockManager. The comparison of blocks should be based on both dtype and location within the manager, rather than just the dtype.

To fix this bug, the comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager should take into account both the dtype and location. This can be achieved by updating the canonicalize function to consider both the dtype and mgr_locs.

The corrected version of the equals function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs to account for dtype and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the equals function should address the issue identified in the failing test and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue. By considering both the dtype and location of the blocks within the BlockManager, the function should now return the expected result of False for the failing test.
