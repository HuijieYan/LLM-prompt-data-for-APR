The cause of the bug: 
The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing DataFrame blocks when they have identical data but are located in different positions. This leads to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with different block positions but the same data.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly compare DataFrame blocks, taking into account their data and positions.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values.nbytes, block._consolidate_inplace()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values.nbytes, block._consolidate_inplace()))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the comparison of DataFrame blocks, taking into account both data and position.

By implementing this fix, the function `equals` should now correctly compare DataFrames, resolving the issue reported in GitHub and passing the failing test.
