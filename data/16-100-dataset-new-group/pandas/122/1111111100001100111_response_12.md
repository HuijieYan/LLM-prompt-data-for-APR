The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return incorrect results. The function is expected to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic inside the `equals` function. It first checks the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` and if they are not equal, it immediately returns `False`. Then it compares each element of `self_axes` with the corresponding element of `other_axes`, using the `equals` method of each pair of elements. If any pair of elements is not equal, it returns `False`. After that, it calls `_consolidate_inplace` on both `self` and `other` and compares the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. If the lengths are not equal, it returns `False`.

The bug seems to arise from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. It's using the `sorted` function with a custom sorting key function `canonicalize`, which in turn uses the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block. 

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is done correctly. We need to identify a consistent and correct way to compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Convert blocks to tuples for easy comparison
    self_blocks = tuple(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = tuple(other.blocks)
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, we are directly comparing the tuples of blocks from `self` and `other` for equality. We assume that the comparison of blocks within the tuples is correctly implemented and will return the expected result for the `equals` function.

This should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result as expected in the GitHub issue.
