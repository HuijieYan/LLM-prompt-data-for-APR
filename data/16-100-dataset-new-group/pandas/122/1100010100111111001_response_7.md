The buggy function `equals` is not handling the comparison of two `BlockManager` objects correctly, resulting in a failed test. Specifically, the function is comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables using the `equals` method, which is not comparing the blocks properly.

To fix this bug, we need to refactor the `equals` function to properly compare the `BlockManager` objects and their blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block in the BlockManager
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares each block in the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other` and returns `True` if all blocks are equal.
