The bug in the provided code is that the `equals` method erroneously returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations. This causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to raise an `AssertionError` with the message `assert True is False`, indicating that the expected output was `False` but the actual output was `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` method correctly checks for the equality of the blocks and their respective locations. We should not only compare the block contents but also take into consideration the block order and the location of each block within the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- Added a check on the block ID and its location to distinguish identical blocks with different locations.
- Sorted the blocks by their canonical form before comparing to ensure that the location is considered in the equality check.

This fix will ensure that the `equals` method correctly handles cases where two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.

With this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, and the GitHub issue related to this bug should be resolved.
