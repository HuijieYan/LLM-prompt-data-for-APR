The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames for equality but is failing for the given test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`. It is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. 

The issue lies in the comparison logic for the blocks within the DataFrames. The function incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False` if the blocks within the DataFrames do not match in the expected order.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic for the blocks within the DataFrames. We can also enhance the canonicalization logic to correctly identify the blocks and compare them.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, and the expected output should be `df1.equals(df2) is False`. Additionally, this fix should resolve the issue posted on GitHub with title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".
