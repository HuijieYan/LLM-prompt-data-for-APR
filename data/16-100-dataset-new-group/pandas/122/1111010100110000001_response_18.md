The buggy function 'equals' is a method of the class 'BlockManager' which is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The function is used to check if the BlockManager object is equal to another BlockManager object passed as an argument. The error message from the failing test suggests that the comparison between two DataFrames using the 'equals' method is resulting in a wrong assertion.

Potential Errors:
1. The error may be due to the comparison of the DataFrames by the 'equals' method within the 'equals' function.
2. There might be a sorting issue with the blocks of the DataFrames.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be in the 'equals' function where it's not comparing the DataFrames correctly, resulting in a wrong assertion. It may also be caused by the sorting of blocks in the DataFrames.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'equals' function is comparing the DataFrames correctly. Additionally, the sorting of blocks should be handled properly to prevent any issues related to block ordering.

Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        # sort the blocks by dtype and mgr_locs
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        
        # consolidate inplace before comparison
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
            
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the 'equals' function first compares the axes and then sorts the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs before consolidating the DataFrames inplace. Finally, it compares each block in both DataFrames using the 'equals' method to determine if they are equal. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
