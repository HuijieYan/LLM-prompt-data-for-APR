The issue with the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is that it is incorrectly returning `True` in some cases where it should be returning `False`. This causes the failing test in `test_dataframe_not_equal` where `df1.equals(df2)` is expected to be `False` but the function returns `True`.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used in the `equals` implementation sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `block.dtype.name`. However, in the failing test, the DataFrame consists of mixed data types, so it results in incorrect comparison and the function incorrectly returns `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks based on their values, regardless of their data types. We can do this by using the values of the blocks instead of their data types for comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function, which addresses the issue and should pass the failing test:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tolist()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will compare the blocks in a DataFrame based on their values, ensuring that the comparison is accurate regardless of the data types of the blocks. This should fix the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub.
