The buggy function `equals` compares the internal data structures of two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the comparison logic used is incorrect, leading to failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects without considering the column order. As a result, the comparison fails when the columns have different data types or are in a different order.

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should consider the column order and data types. This can be achieved by comparing the blocks based on the column names and then the block content.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block by column names and data
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if (self_block.mgr_locs.indexer != other_block.mgr_locs.indexer or
                self_block.dtype != other_block.dtype or
                not np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values)):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects based on column names, data types, and content. This ensures that the comparison is done accurately, taking into account all relevant characteristics of the blocks.
