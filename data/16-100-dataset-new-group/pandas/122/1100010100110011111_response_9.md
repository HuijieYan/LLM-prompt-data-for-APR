The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` is not correctly determining if two DataFrames are equal. It is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is returning `True is False`. This means that the function returned `True` incorrectly, leading to the assertion error.

The expected input and output values are provided as cases, and the failing test requires that `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" provides a simple example that demonstrates the issue. It expects `df3.equals(df4)` to return `False`, but it actually returns `True`, indicating incorrect behavior in the `equals` function.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly compare the DataFrames and return `False` when they are not equal. Specifically, the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` should be modified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.to_slice()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function should satisfy the failing test and the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
