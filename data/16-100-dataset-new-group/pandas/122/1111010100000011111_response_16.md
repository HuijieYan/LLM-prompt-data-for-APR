To fix the bug in the equals function of the BlockManager class, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done correctly, taking into account the block's data type and manager locations.

The bug arises from the sorting and comparison of the blocks. The expected output when comparing two different DataFrames should be False, but the existing implementation might wrongly return True. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done correctly to account for the block's data type and manager locations. We can use the `block.equals` method, which looks like a correct approach for this comparison. However, we need to verify that `block.equals(oblock)` generates the expected output for the given test case and GitHub issue.

Below is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the equals function should compare the blocks correctly, taking into account the block's data type and manager locations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected output in the given test case.
