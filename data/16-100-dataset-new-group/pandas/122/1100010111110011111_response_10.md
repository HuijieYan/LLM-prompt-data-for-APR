The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module. This function is used to determine if two internal DataFrame structures are equal, and it is failing for the case when the blocks in the DataFrames have the same content but different locations.

The failing test is testing the equality of two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, expecting them to be not equal. However, the buggy `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`, causing the test to fail.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the assert statement `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is evaluating to `assert True is False`, which is unexpected.

The expected input and output variable values for the failing test execution are not being satisfied by the buggy function.

The identified potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of DataFrame blocks, as the function does not handle the scenario where blocks have identical content but different locations.
2. Sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize` method, which may not accurately determine block equality.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the scenario where the blocks have identical content but different locations.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    for i, (block, oblock) in enumerate(zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        block = block.consolidate()
        oblock = oblock.consolidate()
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` method is removed and the equality comparison is done directly between the consolidated blocks.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the `equals` method behave correctly in the scenario described in the GitHub issue, allowing the failing test to pass.
