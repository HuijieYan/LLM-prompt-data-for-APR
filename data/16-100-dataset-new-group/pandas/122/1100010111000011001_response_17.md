The issue in the buggy code appears to be related to the comparison of `df1` and `df2`. The `equals` function is not handling the comparison of the DataFrame columns correctly due to the sorting and canonicalization process.

To fix the bug, we should remove the canonicalization process and use a simpler approach to compare the columns of the two DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass successfully.
