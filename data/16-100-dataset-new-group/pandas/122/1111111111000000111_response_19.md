To fix the bug, we need to address the issue where the `equals` function wrongly returns True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The problem lies in the equality comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames. The function does not take into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function, along with an explanation of the changes made:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    # Consolidate self and other DataFrames in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks by data type name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check equality of sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the following changes have been made:
1. The DataFrames `self` and `other` are consolidated in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly compared.
2. The blocks within the DataFrames are sorted before the equality check by combining the data type name and manager locations. This ensures that blocks with the same content but different locations are properly handled.

These changes address the issue reported in the GitHub bug by ensuring that the `equals` function correctly identifies DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations as not equal.

With these changes, the provided failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass.

Please replace the existing `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class with the corrected version provided above. This will resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
