## Correction:

The buggy function `equals` is comparing two dataframes using their internal axes and blocks. The potential error locations in the code could be in the comparison of axes and blocks. 

The cause of the bug in this case is that the function is not properly comparing the dataframes. It is comparing the dataframes using their internal axes and blocks without considering the actual content of the dataframes, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual data in the dataframes instead of comparing their internal axes and blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    return self.equals(other)
```

With this correction, the function now compares the actual data in the dataframes, and the failing test should pass.

We removed the manual comparison of axes and blocks and used the built-in `equals()` method for dataframes, which properly compares the content of the dataframes.
