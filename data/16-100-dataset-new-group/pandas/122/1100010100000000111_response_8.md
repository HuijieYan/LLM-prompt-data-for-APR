The issue reported states that the DataFrame.equals() method returns True when it should return False. This problem occurs when there are identical blocks with different locations. The version of pandas being used is 0.25.0.

The bug in the equals() function is likely to be caused by the sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function based on dtype name and mgr_locs, which might fail when comparing two dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to account for the discrepancy in block locations when comparing two dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.items()), block._values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the canonicalize function now considers the block's dtype name, items, and values. This ensures that the comparison of two dataframes takes into account the identical blocks with different locations, thus fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
