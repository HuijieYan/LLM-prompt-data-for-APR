The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is failing the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` because it does not handle the case where the dataframes have different data types for the same columns. The function currently checks if the dataframes have the same columns and the blocks have the same length, but it does not consider the possibility of different data types.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to compare the data types of the blocks in addition to their values. It should also verify that the number of blocks is matching.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function now checks that the number of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are the same, and then iterates through each block to verify that they have the same data type and data values.

This should address the bug and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
