## Analysis
The buggy function `equals` compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. It then sorts the blocks and compares them for equality. However, the buggy function is returning incorrect results, as seen in the failing test case.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect comparison of axes for equality.
2. Improper sorting and comparison of blocks.

The cause of the bug:
The bug is causing the `equals` function to return `True` when it should return `False` due to an incorrect comparison of axes and blocks.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the comparison of axes for equality.
2. Revise the sorting and comparison of blocks to accurately reflect whether the block managers are equal.

Given the analysis, here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

## Corrected Version
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(
        ax1.equals(ax2)
        for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)
    ):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.get_slice(None, 0).as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version above, the `equals` function should now return the correct results and pass the failing test.
