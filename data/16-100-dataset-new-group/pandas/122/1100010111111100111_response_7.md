The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to how the DataFrame objects are being compared. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` and expecting them to not be equal. However, the actual implementation of the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the DataFrames.

The `equals` function starts by comparing the `self.axes` and `other.axes` to check if they have the same lengths and elements. Then it proceeds to check if the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` have the same length and if the blocks are equal. The issue seems to be with the comparison of the blocks.

The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. However, it appears that the comparison of the sorted blocks can lead to incorrect results, which may explain the failing test.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function should be revised. Instead of sorting the blocks using `canonicalize`, a direct comparison of blocks should be implemented. Additionally, the comparison logic should consider the data and indices of the blocks to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if not len(self.blocks) == len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, the comparison logic directly iterates through the blocks and checks for equality. This ensures that each block in `self.blocks` is compared with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. This should address the issue identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
