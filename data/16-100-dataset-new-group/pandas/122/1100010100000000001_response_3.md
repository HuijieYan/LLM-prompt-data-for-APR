## Analyzing the buggy function:
The `equals` function is meant to compare two objects for equality. It compares the axes and blocks of the two objects. However, there are potential error locations within the function, such as the usage of `self._consolidate_inplace()` and the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on `canonicalize` function.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The usage of `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` may lead to unexpected side effects and mutability issues.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on `canonicalize` function may not correctly handle all possible block types and orderings.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the function might be caused by the mutability of the objects due to the use of `_consolidate_inplace()` and the potential incorrect sorting of blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Avoid mutability issues by not using `_consolidate_inplace()` and creating new objects for comparison.
2. Use a more robust and general approach for sorting the blocks.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.index))
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.index))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the usage of `_consolidate_inplace()` and instead created new references for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to avoid mutability issues. We also revised the sorting of blocks using a more robust approach.
