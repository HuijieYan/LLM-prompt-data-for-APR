The bug in the `equals` function is likely related to the comparison of the blocks that make up the DataFrames. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function erroneously returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but with different locations. 

The bug appears to be caused by the sorting of the blocks prior to comparison. Sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations could lead to an incorrect comparison, especially if the blocks have different locations but identical contents.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to identify and compare the blocks directly without sorting them based on their type and manager locations. This will ensure that the comparison is based solely on the actual content of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are compared directly without being sorted, ensuring that the comparison is based solely on the block content. This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` now returns `False` as expected.
