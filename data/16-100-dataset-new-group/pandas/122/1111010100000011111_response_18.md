The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return incorrect values when comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances.

The bug occurs in the `canonicalize` function, where the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks is being converted into a list using `.as_array.tolist()`. The bug is causing identical blocks with different locations to be incorrectly identified as different. As a result, the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` when comparing BlockManagers with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should use the `array_repr` method of `mgr_locs` to obtain a stable representation of the block's locations, ensuring that identical blocks are correctly identified as such.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then array_repr of mgr_locs to ensure stable identifcation
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.array_repr())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The fix involves using the `array_repr` method to obtain a stable representation of the block's locations, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as such. This solution addresses the bug and ensures that the `equals` function returns the correct values when comparing BlockManagers with identical blocks but different locations.
