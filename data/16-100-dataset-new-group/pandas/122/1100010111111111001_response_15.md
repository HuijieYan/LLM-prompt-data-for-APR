The bug in the `equals` function is likely causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return an AssertionError. The failing test compares two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` and expects them to be unequal, but the buggy `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

By analyzing the provided code, we can see that the `equals` function compares two BlockManagers `self` and `other`. It first checks that the lengths of their axes are the same, then it calls the `equals` method for each pair of axes using a generator expression. After that, it consolidates both `self` and `other` BlockManagers inplace, and checks the lengths of their blocks. Finally, it sorts the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function, and checks if each pair of blocks are equal using another generator expression.

The bug is likely occurring in the last step of comparing the blocks, as it is returning `True` when it should return `False` according to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we can modify the last part of the `equals` function where it compares the sorted self and other blocks. We need to ensure that the comparison is returning the correct value (i.e., `False` when the blocks are found to be unequal).

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and correctly identify when the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal.
