The bug in the `equals` function causes it to incorrectly return `True` in cases where DataFrame objects have identical blocks but at different locations. This is due to the sorting method used within the function, which assumes that block positions determine equality, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way blocks are sorted and compared within the `equals` function. Instead of using the block position, we should compare the actual block contents for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Extract blocks' values for comparison
    self_blocks_values = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_values = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
  
    # Compare block values for equality
    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_block, other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks_values, other_blocks_values)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now compare block values for equality rather than the block positions, ensuring that it returns the correct result in cases where blocks are identical but at different positions.

This fix should resolve the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub.
