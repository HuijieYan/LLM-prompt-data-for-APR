The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The function compares two BlockManager instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` lengths, the comparison of individual axes using `equals`, and the comparison of the blocks after sorting.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not take into account the order of the blocks, leading to false positives in cases where the blocks have identical values but are located in different places within the BlockManager.

To fix the bug, we need to include the locations of the blocks in the comparison. One strategy for fixing the bug is to create a canonical representation of the blocks that includes both the type name and the locations. This canonical representation can then be used for comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function creates a tuple with the type name of the block and its locations. This tuple is then used to sort the blocks before comparing them. This strategy ensures that the comparison takes into account the locations of the blocks, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
