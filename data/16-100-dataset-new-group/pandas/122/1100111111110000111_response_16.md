The root cause of the bug in the `equals` function lies in how it handles the comparison of two dataframes. The function sorts the blocks within the dataframes by their type name and their locations, but this approach does not account for unconsolidated blocks such as Categorical types. This causes the function to incorrectly return True for identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks in a way that it effectively distinguishes between unconsolidated blocks. Additionally, we should ensure that the comparison process handles unconsolidated blocks correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will be able to handle unconsolidated blocks properly and return the expected output, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
