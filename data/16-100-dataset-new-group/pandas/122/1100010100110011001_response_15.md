There are multiple issues with the buggy function `equals`:

1. The function is not properly comparing the values of `df1` and `df2` which are DataFrames.
2. The error message indicates that `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, meaning that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison logic for comparing two DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        return False
    
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
        
    return True
```

This corrected version first checks if `other` is an instance of the same type as `self`. If not, it returns `False`. Then, it compares the axes using the `equals` method of the `axes` attribute. If the axes are not equal, it returns `False`. Then, it compares the blocks using the `equals` method. If any block is not equal, it returns `False`. If all comparisons pass, it returns `True`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
