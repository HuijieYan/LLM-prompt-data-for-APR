The bug in the equals function lies in the canonicalization of the blocks. The function tries to sort the blocks based on their data types and manager locations. However, the comparison of the blocks using the equals method is incorrect. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when comparing different BlockManager instances. The correct strategy for fixing the bug is to properly compare the blocks using the equals method after sorting them based on data types and manager locations.

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
By properly comparing the blocks using the equals method after sorting them based on data types and manager locations, the corrected function now satisfies the expected input/output values.
