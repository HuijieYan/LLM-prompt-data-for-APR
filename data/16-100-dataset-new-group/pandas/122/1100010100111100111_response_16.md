## Analyzing the buggy function and the error message

The buggy function is the `equals` method in the pandas.core.internals.managers module. The error message indicates that the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames are expected to not be equal, but the assertion fails because `df1.equals(df2)` returns True instead of False.

The buggy function compares two BlockManager objects, which contain axes and blocks. The comparison involves checking if the axes have the same length, if each axis is equal, and if the blocks are equal.

The error message indicates that the comparison is wrongly returning True when it should be False.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error location could be in the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method, as well as the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug is due to the comparison of blocks not correctly identifying that the DataFrames are not equal. The sorting of blocks and comparison using the `equals` method might not be appropriately considering the different block locations.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

One strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the block comparison and sorting to take into account the block locations. This could involve comparing both the block content and the block locations to determine if two DataFrames are equal.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers both the type name, block values, and block locations when sorting the blocks. The comparison using `equals` now takes into account both the content and block locations to determine if two DataFrames are equal. This should address the issue and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result.
