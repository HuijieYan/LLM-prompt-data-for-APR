The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other` for equality. The function is failing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` which checks if two DataFrames with different column types are not equal.

The issue seems to be with the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The blocks are being sorted based on the `canonicalize` function, but the issue seems to be in the `canonicalize` function.

The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the `BlockManager` class and once outside the class. It seems that the intended `canonicalize` function to be used is the one within the `BlockManager` class, however, the one outside the class is being used instead.

To fix this bug, the duplicated `canonicalize` function outside the `BlockManager` class needs to be removed so that the correct function is called.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function with the fix:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Remove the duplicated canonicalize function and use the one within the class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the corrected function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
