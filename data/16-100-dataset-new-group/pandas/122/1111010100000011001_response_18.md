The bug in the provided function `equals` appears to be related to the way it handles comparing the attributes of the `BlockManager` class. It seems that the function is not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of the two instances of `BlockManager`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is done accurately and consistently.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances are compared correctly and then proceeds to compare their blocks. If any part of the comparison fails, the function will return `False`. If all comparisons pass, the function will return `True`.

This corrected version aligns with the expected input/output values and the bug analysis provided.
