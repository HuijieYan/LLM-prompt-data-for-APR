The buggy function `equals` is failing to correctly compare two instances of BlockManager. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different order of columns, and expects the `equals` method to return `False`, but it is currently returning `True`.

The potential error location is in the logic of comparing the blocks of the two instances of BlockManager.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks of the two instances of BlockManager, leading to the wrong return value.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for comparing the blocks of the two instances of BlockManager in a way that it correctly considers the order of the data as well.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_block_values = [(block._block_type, block.values) for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_values = [(block._block_type, block.values) for block in other.blocks]

    return self_block_values == other_block_values
```

In this corrected version, we are comparing the block values of the two instances of BlockManager to ensure that the data order is taken into account. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
