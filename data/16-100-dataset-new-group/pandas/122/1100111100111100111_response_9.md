## Correction:

Looking at the error message and the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the incorrect comparison of two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The function is comparing the blocks of the DataFrames without considering the location of the blocks.

The cause of the bug lies in the `canonicalize` function, which is not correctly comparing the locations of the blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function and ensure that it considers the locations of the blocks. Additionally, we need to update the comparison logic to consider the locations as well.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to include block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function uses a modified `canonicalize` function that includes the block locations when comparing the DataFrames. With this modification, the function should now correctly compare the DataFrames and return the expected result, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
