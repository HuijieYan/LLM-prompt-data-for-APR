The bug in the provided function `equals` causes it to incorrectly identify that two DataFrames are not equal when they should be. This is due to the way the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted and compared. The bug relies on the fact that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice within the same function, which leads to confusion in which version of `canonicalize` is being used. Also, the sorting is done incorrectly, resulting in the wrong comparison of blocks.

To fix the bug, the duplicate `canonicalize` function definition should be removed, and the sorting logic should be updated to properly compare the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should pass the failing test.
