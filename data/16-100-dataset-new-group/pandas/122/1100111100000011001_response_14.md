## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function was caused by the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function should be defined and called as `canonicalize_block` to avoid conflicts with other functions in the same module.

The bug can be fixed by renaming the `canonicalize` function to `canonicalize_block` to avoid name conflicts with other functions in the same module. The corrected function uses the renamed `canonicalize_block` function to properly sort the blocks.

With these changes, the corrected function is expected to satisfy all the provided test cases.
