## Corrections:

1. The `equals` function did not handle the comparison of data between `self` and `other` correctly, resulting in a false assertion. The bug stemmed from the comparison of block data within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

2. The cause of the bug was the incorrect comparison of blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, leading to the `equals` function returning `True` instead of `False` as expected. The failing test showed that two DataFrames with identical data but different locations were not being correctly evaluated as unequal. The error message, assertion, and return showed that the expected result was `False`, but the actual result was `True`.

3. To fix the bug, we should revise the comparison of blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` in the `equals` function.

4. The corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now handle the comparison of blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` correctly, ensuring that the DataFrames are evaluated for equality as expected.
