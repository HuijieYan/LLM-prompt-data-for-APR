The buggy function `equals` is failing the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` because it compares two dataframes `df1` and `df2` and incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`. The function is trying to compare the axes, block shape, and block data of the two dataframes, but due to incorrect comparisons and sorting, it fails to correctly identify that the dataframes are not equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of axes using `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Incorrect comparison of blocks using `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
3. Incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists.

The cause of the bug is that the function is comparing the attributes of the dataframe incorrectly, leading to the incorrect determination of dataframe equality.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Correctly compare the axes of the two dataframes by checking if they have the same labels and order.
2. Correctly compare the blocks of the two dataframes by checking for the same shape and data values.
3. Sort the blocks within `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using a key that combines the block type name and `mgr_locs` to ensure consistent comparison.

The corrected version of the buggy function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate both BlockManagers
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks by combining the block type name and mgr_locs
    def key_func(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=key_func)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=key_func)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function will correctly compare the axes, consolidate the BlockManagers, sort the blocks, and finally compare each pair of blocks for equality, passing the failing test.
