The buggy function `equals` is comparing two objects based on their attributes and internal blocks. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the number of axes in `self` and `other`.
2. The comparison of the axes using the `equals` method.
3. The call to `_consolidate_inplace` for both `self` and `other`.
4. Sorting the blocks and comparing them.

The potential cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that the comparison of the axes may not be accurate, and sorting blocks based on a custom key may introduce errors.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that the comparison of axes and block sorting is accurate and aligns with the expected behavior of the `equals` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate inplace for both self and other
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort the blocks based on type name and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of axes and sorting of blocks is done accurately, aligning with the expected behavior of the `equals` function.
