The bug in the given function is likely causing the failing test. Let's analyze the issues and propose a fix.

### Issue:
The main issue with the `equals` function is that it's not comparing the DataFrame contents correctly. The current implementation doesn't handle DataFrame comparison properly, leading to unexpected results.

### Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure that the function accurately compares the contents of the DataFrames, including the values in the columns.
2. We also need to ensure that the comparison is flexible enough to handle different column orders.

### Bug Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.index.equals(other.index):
        return False
    if not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

This fix ensures that the index and columns of the DataFrames are compared first, and then their values are compared. By using `equals` method directly on the DataFrames, we can accurately compare their contents.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test.
