The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` in cases where identical blocks have different locations. This is leading to failing tests and an issue on GitHub.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the blocks in self and other when checking for equality. This is leading to incorrect results and causing the failing test. The incorrect output is due to the function not properly handling the order in which blocks are sorted and compared.

To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the blocks in self and other while taking into account their actual content and not just their order or locations. This can be achieved by directly comparing the values in the blocks instead of just sorting and comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    equal_blocks = True
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            equal_blocks = False
            break

    return equal_blocks
```

With this corrected version, the function now directly compares the content of the blocks in self and other, ensuring that the comparison provides accurate results. This will address the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
