The buggy function is the equals() method within the BlockManager class. The test_dataframe_not_equal() test in the test_internals.py file checks for inequality between two dataframes using the equals() method. The error message indicates an AssertionError caused by the method returning True instead of False, resulting in a failed test.

The potential error locations within the buggy equals() function are:
1. Comparison of self.axes and other.axes.
2. Comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the equals() method does not compare the content of the dataframes correctly. It only compares the axes and blocks based on their references, resulting in a false positive when the dataframes actually contain different values.

To fix the bug, the equals() method needs to be modified to compare the content of the dataframes instead of just their references.

Here's the corrected version of the equals() function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        if not self.index.equals(other.index) or not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(self.values, other.values):
            return False
        return True
```

In this corrected version, the equals() method first compares the indices and columns of the dataframes. If they are not equal, the method returns False. Then, it compares the values using np.array_equal() to check if the content of the dataframes is the same. If the values are not equal, the method returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

With this corrected version, the equals() method should now pass the failing test.
