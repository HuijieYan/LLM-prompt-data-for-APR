The error message suggests that the function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is returning an incorrect result when comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2`.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. The comparison of axis lengths.
2. The comparison of individual axes using the `equals` method.
3. The sorting and comparison of blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not handling the comparison of the dataframes correctly, causing it to return an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic for all the components of the dataframes, including their axes and blocks, is correct.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, repr(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `equals` function should now produce the correct comparison results, and the failing test should pass.
