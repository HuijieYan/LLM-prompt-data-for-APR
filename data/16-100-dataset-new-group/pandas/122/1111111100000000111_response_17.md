The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` in cases where there are identical blocks with different locations. This is a clear deviation from the expected behavior, as shown in the provided GitHub issue where `df3.equals(df4)` is expected to return `False`.

The cause of this bug lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares the axes of two objects (`self` and `other`), and if they are all equal, it proceeds to sort and compare the blocks within these objects. However, the comparison of the blocks does not account for the different locations of the identical blocks, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to also consider the locations of the blocks while performing the comparison. One way to achieve this is by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the location of the blocks. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are treated as distinct, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include the location of the blocks in the canonical representation
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the location of the blocks in the tuple that represents the canonical order. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be treated as different, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
