The buggy function `equals` is part of the class `BlockManager` in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks. The potential location of the error is in the comparison of the blocks.

The cause of the bug appears to be in the comparison of the blocks. The function `canonicalize` is intended to standardize the order of the blocks before comparison, but there is no defined `canonicalize` method within the `BlockManager` class, leading to the bug. 

To fix the bug, we can define a `canonicalize` method within the `BlockManager` class to standardize the order of the blocks before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, I added a `canonicalize` method within the `BlockManager` class. Within the `equals` method, this `canonicalize` method is used to standardize the order of the blocks before comparison, fixing the bug in the original function.
