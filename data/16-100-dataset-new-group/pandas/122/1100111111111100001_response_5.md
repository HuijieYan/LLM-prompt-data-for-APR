The bug in the `equals` function lies in how it compares the two BlockManager objects. The comparison is based on the axes, the number of blocks, and the equality of the individual blocks. However, the bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is not implemented correctly and does not return the desired tuple of `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` for each block. This leads to incorrect sorting of the blocks and ultimately the wrong comparison result.

To fix the bug, we need to create a correct implementation of the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function with the fixed `canonicalize` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other functions...
    
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # corrected implementation of the canonicalize function
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
            
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

After making this change, the `equals` function should work correctly and pass the failing test.
