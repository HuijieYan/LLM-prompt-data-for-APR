## Correction:

The issue here is that the buggy `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False` for two DataFrames that are not equal. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` within the `equals` function.

The `equals` function compares the axes of the two DataFrames and then checks if their blocks are equal by canonicalizing the blocks. The bug occurs when the function incorrectly returns `True` for two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted([(block.values, block.mgr_locs) for block in self.blocks])
    other_blocks = sorted([(block.values, block.mgr_locs) for block in other.blocks])
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block[0], oblock[0]) and block[1].equals(oblock[1]) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function addresses the issue by comparing both the values and the locations of the blocks in the DataFrames. It should now pass the failing test and return the expected output.
