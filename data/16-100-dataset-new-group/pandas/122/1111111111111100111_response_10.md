To correct the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done correctly. The current implementation of the function does not handle identical blocks with different locations as expected, leading to the failing test case. 

The cause of the bug is that the function treats identical blocks with different locations as different, leading to an incorrect evaluation of equality.

To correct this, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also consider the block's mgr_locs in the comparison. Additionally, we can modify the sorting of the blocks to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are treated as equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    # Check if lengths of axes are equal
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Check if axes are equal
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a canonicalize function to consider mgr_locs as well
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check block-wise equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function now considers `mgr_locs` as part of the equivalence criteria for blocks when checking for equality, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are handled properly.

This should resolve the issue that was reported in the GitHub bug report. The corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case and correctly handle equality comparison between dataframes.
