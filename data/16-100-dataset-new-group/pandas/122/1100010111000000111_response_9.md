The buggy function `equals` is not correctly identifying when two dataframes are not equal, as indicated by the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The issue on GitHub titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" indicates that when calling `df3.equals(df4)`, it incorrectly returns True instead of False as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks in the dataframes, but it doesn't take into account the actual content of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison between the actual content of the blocks is performed correctly.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly by their content
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly identify when two dataframes are not equal, passing the failing test case and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
