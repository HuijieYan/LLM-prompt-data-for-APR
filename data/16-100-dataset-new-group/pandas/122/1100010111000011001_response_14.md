The buggy function `equals` is meant to check if two objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, it fails to compare the values within the DataFrame's columns. 

The potential error in the code lies in the comparison of the self and other blocks. It does not properly check for equality among the values.

The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two data frames `df1` and `df2` with different values in their columns. The expected output is `False` since the two data frames are not equal.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to iterate over each value in the data frames and ensure they are equal, in addition to comparing their axes and blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function now iterates over each block in the data frames and checks if they are equal. This modification ensures that the function will return the correct result for the failing test case.
