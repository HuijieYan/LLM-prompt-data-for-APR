### Analysis
- The `equals` function is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` file.
- This function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects to see if they are equal.
- The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the `equals` method returned `True` instead of `False`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison logic in the function's `equals` method may be incorrect.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` could lead to an incorrect result if the location of the blocks differs.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of blocks with different locations within the `BlockManager` objects. This results in the method incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to handle blocks with different locations correctly.
2. Ensure that the method returns `False` when comparing `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different locations.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or set(self_axes) != set(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = {block: i for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)}
    other_blocks = {block: i for i, block in enumerate(other.blocks)}

    if set(self_blocks) != set(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(other.blocks[self_blocks[block]])
        for block in self.blocks
    )
```
This corrected version includes additional checks for the matching lengths and sets of axes between the `BlockManager` objects and compares the blocks using dictionaries to handle differences in block locations.
