The buggy function `equals` is expected to compare two pandas objects for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two dataframes `df1` and `df2` and expects them to be not equal. However, the function `equals` returns True instead, causing the test to fail.

The main issues in the `equals` function are the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. This sorting does not consider the order of the columns in the dataframe, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type and the column order. Then, sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists based on the modified `canonicalize` function to ensure consistent comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include both data type and column order in canonicalization
        return (block.values.tolist(), block.dtypes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `equals` function should perform consistent and correct comparison of two dataframes, passing the failing test.
