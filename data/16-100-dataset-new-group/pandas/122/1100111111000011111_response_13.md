The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks between two dataframes. The bug causes the function to return `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to properly sort and compare the blocks in both dataframes based on their data type and manager locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the comparison of blocks and return the expected result.

The corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
