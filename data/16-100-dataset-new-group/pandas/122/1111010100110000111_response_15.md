Based on the error message, the failing test, and the GitHub issue, the buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False` due to identical blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly considering the order of blocks. When comparing the blocks of two dataframes, the function should take into account the order of the blocks. However, the current implementation is not doing this, leading to the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class to account for the block order when checking for equality. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks before comparing them, which will ensure that blocks with different locations are detected as unequal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on canonicalization before comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly detect that the dataframes with identical blocks but different locations are not equal, and the failing test should pass.
