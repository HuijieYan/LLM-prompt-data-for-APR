Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Wrong comparison of DataFrame using the `.equals` method.
2. It is not handling the case of identical blocks with different locations.
3. Sorting of blocks and comparing them without considering their locations.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function `equals` is not taking into account the different locations of identical blocks when comparing two DataFrames using the `.equals` method. This causes the function to return `True` when it should return `False`, leading to the failing test case and the reported GitHub issue.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the locations of the blocks.
2. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the locations when comparing the blocks of the DataFrames.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now properly handle the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, resolving the reported GitHub issue and also passing the failing test case.
