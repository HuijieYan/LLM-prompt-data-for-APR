## Correction

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is defined both inside the `BlockManager` class and outside as a global function. This causes the wrong `canonicalize` function to be called when sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct `canonicalize` function is being called when sorting the blocks. We can achieve this by renaming the global `canonicalize` function to something else, so it does not conflict with the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected global canonicalize function name to avoid conflicts
    def canonicalize_global(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_global)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_global)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By renaming the global `canonicalize` function to `canonicalize_global`, we prevent the conflict and ensure that the correct `canonicalize` function is called when sorting the blocks. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected.
