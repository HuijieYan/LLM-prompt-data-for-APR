The bug in the `equals` function appears to be related to the comparison of DataFrame objects in Pandas. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` shows that when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method, the function returns `True` when it should return `False` as the DataFrames have different column types.

The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises from how the function compares the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and how it handles the canonicalization of the blocks.

In the buggy code, the canonicalization is performed using a sorting method for the blocks. This sorting method is not robust enough to handle cases where the blocks have different types, as in the failing test. As a result, the comparison returns `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalization process to differentiate and compare blocks based on their data types and content.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [(block.get_values(), block.values) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.get_values(), block.values) for block in other.blocks]

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version:
1. The comparison now directly compares the `get_values()` and `values` of the blocks to account for differences in data types and content.
2. The sorting method has been replaced with a direct comparison of the lists of blocks, avoiding the need for canonicalization.

With these changes, the `equals` function should now compare DataFrames accurately and pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
