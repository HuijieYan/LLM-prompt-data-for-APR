The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function. The function takes a `block` as a parameter and is meant to return a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs` because there might be unconsolidated blocks which can only be distinguished by the iteration order. However, the `canonicalize` function is not defined correctly for handling the `block` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `canonicalize` function to correctly extract the necessary information from the `block` parameter and return a tuple with the type name and `mgr_locs`. Then, use the correct `canonicalize` function in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the correct canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function correctly extracts the type name of the block and its `mgr_locs` to create the necessary tuple. Then, these tuples are used for sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparison, fixing the bug in the function.
