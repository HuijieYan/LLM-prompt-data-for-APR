The bug in the `equals` function appears to stem from the way it compares `self_axes` and `other_axes`, and then sorts the blocks and compares them for equality. It seems that the equality check between `self_axes` and `other_axes` might not be functioning as expected. Additionally, the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function might not be accurate.

The correct strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` for equality and ensuring that the sorting of the blocks is done correctly using the `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected function, the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` uses the `equals` method, and the sorting of the blocks uses the `canonicalize` function correctly. This should ensure that the `equals` function now accurately checks for equality between two instances of the `BlockManager` class.
