The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to inaccurately return True when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal. This is occurring due to the incorrect comparison of blocks in the function. To fix this bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be revised to accurately compare the blocks between the two DataFrames.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks in the sorted order
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will accurately compare the blocks between the two DataFrames, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
