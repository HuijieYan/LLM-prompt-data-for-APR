### Bug Analysis
The failing test is producing the error message `assert True is False`. This indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This indicates that the `equals` function is not correctly identifying that `df1` and `df2` are not equal.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables within the function, it seems that the function is comparing the two `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other` by checking their axes and blocks. However, it is likely that the ordering of the blocks is not being handled correctly, leading to the mismatch between `df1` and `df2` in the failing test.

The relevant GitHub issue mentions that the `equals` method is supposed to return `False`, but it is incorrectly returning `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the canonicalization of the blocks (sorting the blocks based on type and location) should be done more effectively to ensure the comparison is accurate. This should involve sorting the blocks in a way that accounts for the different locations of identical blocks.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, the `canonicalize` function now creates a tuple with the block's type name and a tuple representation of the block's `mgr_locs`, ensuring that the blocks are properly sorted. This should resolve the issue and make the function accurately compare the `BlockManager` objects.
