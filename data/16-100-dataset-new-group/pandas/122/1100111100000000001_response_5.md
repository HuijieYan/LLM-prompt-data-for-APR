The buggy function is the "equals" function within the BlockManager class. The function is designed to compare two BlockManager objects for equality.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of lengths of self_axes and other_axes without first checking if they are not None.
2. The call to self._consolidate_inplace() and other._consolidate_inplace() without checking if the 'blocks' attribute exists in self and other, which may result in an AttributeError.
3. The sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks without first ensuring that the 'blocks' attribute exists.

The cause of the bug is the assumption that the required attributes and methods (e.g., self_axes, other_axes, self._consolidate_inplace(), self.blocks, etc.) exist in all cases without explicitly checking for their existence.

To fix the bug, we can use the following strategy:
1. Check if self_axes and other_axes are not None before comparing their lengths.
2. Check if the 'blocks' attribute exists in self and other before calling self._consolidate_inplace() and other._consolidate_inplace(), and before sorting self_blocks and other_blocks.
3. Consider handling cases where the required attributes and methods may not exist, and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if self_axes is not None and other_axes is not None:
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
    
    if hasattr(self, 'blocks') and hasattr(other, 'blocks'):
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize) if hasattr(self, 'blocks') else []
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize) if hasattr(other, 'blocks') else []
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
    else:
        return False
```
