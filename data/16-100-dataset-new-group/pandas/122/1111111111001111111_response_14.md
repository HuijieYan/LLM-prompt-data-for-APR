The bug in the `equals` function is leading to incorrect output for the given test case. The issue is related to `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug can be found in the `equals` function where the block order is being canonicalized using block data type and location. However, the comparison is being done using `block.equals()`, which does not take into account the correct comparison of block locations.

To fix the bug, the comparison should include the check for block locations as well, in addition to the data type.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now properly compares the block locations in addition to the data type, ensuring that the comparison is accurate and the failing test should pass.

This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub, where the `equals` function wrongly returned `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations.
