The bug in the `equals` function is causing the AssertionError in the failing test. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. However, there is an error in the logic of the comparison.

The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to how the blocks are being compared for equality. The comparison logic appears to be incorrect when sorting and comparing the blocks.

To fix the bug in the `equals` function, a strategy would be to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly for equality. This may involve iterating through the blocks and comparing their contents.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare each block for equality
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates through the blocks of `self` and `other`, comparing each block for equality. If any block is found to be unequal, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if all blocks are equal, the function returns `True`.

By using this corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test should now pass without any assertion errors.
