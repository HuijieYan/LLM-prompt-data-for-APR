The buggy function seems to be a method in a class named `BlockManager` that compares two instances of `BlockManager` (`self` and `other`) based on their `axes` and `blocks` attributes.

The bug occurs when the function tries to call the method `_consolidate_inplace()`. This method is called on both `self` and `other` instances, but the class `BlockManager` does not have a method named `_consolidate_inplace`. It is possible that the method should have been inherited from another class or was meant to be implemented in the `BlockManager` class.

To fix the bug, the `_consolidate_inplace()` method needs to be properly defined and implemented in the `BlockManager` class.

Here's the corrected version of the function with the missing method:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other methods...

    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # Implementation of the _consolidate_inplace method
        pass

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Other parts of the equals method...
```
With the above correction, the `_consolidate_inplace()` method will be properly defined and available for use within the `BlockManager` class, and the buggy function will be able to call it without any issues.
