## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
The `equals` function appears to be attempting to compare two data objects for equality, but it seems to be encountering issues when dealing with blocks of data with different locations. The function tries to consolidate the data in place and then sort the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, using the `canonicalize` function. It then attempts to compare the sorted blocks for equality.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug causes the `equals` function to return True even when the two DataFrames should not be considered equal. The bug results from the incorrect handling of blocks with different locations, leading to a false positive when checking for equality.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the `equals` function to properly handle blocks with different locations and ensure that the comparison of DataFrames reflects the expected behavior in the test case provided.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function that should address the bug:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return len(self.blocks) == len(other.blocks) and all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the comparison of DataFrames with blocks of data having different locations correctly. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes as expected.
