The potential error location within the equals function is likely to be in the sorting and comparison of self_blocks and other_blocks. An improper sorting or comparison could lead to the incorrect comparison result.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the two DataFrames df1 and df2. It is returning an incorrect result when checking for equality between the two DataFrames due to an error in sorting and comparing the blocks.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that self_blocks and other_blocks are sorted and compared correctly. This can be accomplished by using the sorted function with an appropriate key function that properly considers the dtype and block location, and then comparing each corresponding block using the equals method.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This corrected version should properly compare the blocks between the two DataFrames and return the correct result when checking for equality.
