The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return an assertion error. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances to determine whether they are equal, based on their axes and blocks.

The bug seems to stem from the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The function attempts to canonicalize the block order and then compare the blocks using the `equals` method, but the order of the blocks is not handled correctly.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks in a deterministic manner, considering the order of the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks has been replaced by a lambda function, which sorts the blocks based on their type name and then `mgr_locs`. This ensures a deterministic ordering of the blocks for comparison.

With these changes, the `equals` function should pass the failing test and correctly determine whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal.
