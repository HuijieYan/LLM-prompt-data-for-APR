The bug in the `equals` function causes it to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is contrary to the expected behavior of returning `False`. 

The cause of the bug is related to how the function compares the blocks using the `equals` method. In particular, the function fails to consider the block locations when comparing, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the sorting and comparison process of the blocks. The comparison process should take into account the type name and the manager locations to properly distinguish between blocks. Additionally, we need to ensure that the order of the blocks is consistent and that blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function now properly sorts and compares the blocks based on the type name and manager locations, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue. This updated approach ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal, aligning with the expected behavior.
