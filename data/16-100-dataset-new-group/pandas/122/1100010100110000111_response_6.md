The buggy function `equals` is used to check if two objects are equal. In the failing test case provided, the function `equals` incorrectly returns True when it should return False. This is a bug reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

Potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Comparing the lengths of `self.axes` and `other.axes` to check if they are equal.
2. Sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function `equals` does not handle the case where identical blocks with different locations should be considered unequal. This leads to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to include the block location when comparing blocks. This will ensure that blocks with different locations are considered unequal even if their content is identical.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and values because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `canonicalize` function includes the block values in the comparison, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations will be considered unequal. This should resolve the bug and make the function `equals` work as expected.
