The buggy function `equals` in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file. The error message highlights that the `assert True is False` fails, indicating that the `equals` function returns `True` instead of `False` as expected.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the comparison and sorting of the blocks within the `canonicalize` function. This is likely causing the inconsistency in the comparison, resulting in the unexpected return of `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the `canonicalize` function need to be revised to ensure a consistent and accurate comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if block.dtype.name == 'IntBlock':
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values)
        else:
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to include the comparison of block values. This ensures that different block locations with identical values will be correctly treated as unequal, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
