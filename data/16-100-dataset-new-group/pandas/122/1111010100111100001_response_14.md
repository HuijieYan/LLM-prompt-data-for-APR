The issue with the `equals` function is that it is comparing the blocks of one BlockManager with the blocks of another, but the comparison logic is incorrect and leads to the wrong return value. The function needs to compare the shapes of the blocks to ensure they are identical, and then compare their values.

The root cause of the bug is that the comparison logic for the blocks is incorrect due to a missing check on the shape of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the shapes of the two BlockManagers are the same. If not, it should return False. Then, it should compare the blocks within each BlockManager to check if they are equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if self.blocks[i].shape != other.blocks[i].shape:
            return False
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the function checks the shapes of the blocks and then compares their values to ensure they are equal. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
