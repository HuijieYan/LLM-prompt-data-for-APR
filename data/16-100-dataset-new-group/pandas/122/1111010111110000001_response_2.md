The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class which is used for comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function currently has a bug that causes it to fail when comparing two DataFrames.

The bug is likely to be due to the way the function is comparing the two `BlockManager` objects and their underlying data. It seems to be incorrectly comparing the axes and blocks of the two objects, resulting in the wrong comparison result.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` function to compare the contents of the data within the `BlockManager` objects instead of their structure. We should compare the columns and their values in the DataFrames to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False
    if not self.index.equals(other.index):
        return False
    if not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

In this corrected version, we are using the `equals` method of the index, columns, and values of the DataFrames to perform the comparison for equality. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
