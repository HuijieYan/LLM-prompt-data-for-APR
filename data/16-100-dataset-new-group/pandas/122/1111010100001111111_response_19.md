The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the DataFrame equals method to return True even when the blocks have different locations. This is evident from the failing test case where `df3.equals(df4)` should return False, but it returns True instead.

The cause of the bug is identified in the `canonicalize` function, where the block locations (mgr_locs) are not being considered when sorting the blocks. This results in identical blocks with different locations being considered equal, leading to incorrect behavior in the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, the comparison should consider both the block type and the block locations. Sorting the blocks using a tuple combining the block's type name and the mgr_locs will properly differentiate between identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using a tuple of the block's type name and the mgr_locs as the key for sorting, the blocks will be properly differentiated based on their locations, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
