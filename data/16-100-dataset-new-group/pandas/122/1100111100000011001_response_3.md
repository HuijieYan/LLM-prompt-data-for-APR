## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexers)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
1. The original code has an issue in the `canonicalize` function where the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object is accessed with a method but should be accessed directly as an attribute.
2. The corrected code updates the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` object.
3. The corrected `canonicalize` function returns a tuple of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.indexers` to ensure unique identification of the blocks being compared.
4. With these updates, the corrected function should now be able to compare the blocks accurately and return the expected results.
