The buggy function `equals` is currently failing the test due to a comparison between two dataframes `df1` and `df2`. The error message indicates that the comparison `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is evaluating to `True` rather than `False`.

The potential error in the buggy function is likely occurring at the point of sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. This is because the `canonicalize` function is not implemented correctly, causing incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is nested within the `equals` function and does not properly handle the comparison between blocks of different data types.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be implemented to correctly compare and sort the blocks before proceeding with the comparison of the dataframes.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, (NumericBlock, DatetimeBlock)):
            return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        elif isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
        else:
            return str(type(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to effectively handle sorting and comparison of blocks across different data types, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
