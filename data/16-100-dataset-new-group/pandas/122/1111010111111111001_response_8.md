The bug in the `equals` method is likely due to the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The bug is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to produce incorrect results, as evidenced by the provided input/output variable values.

The input parameters of the buggy function and their types are as follows:
- `self.axes`: A list of axes containing the index and columns of the DataFrame.
- `self`: A BlockManager object representing the DataFrame.
- `other.axes`: A list of axes for the second DataFrame.
- `other`: A BlockManager object representing the second DataFrame.
- `self.blocks`: A tuple of blocks for the DataFrame.
- `other.blocks`: A tuple of blocks for the second DataFrame.

The variables right before the return of the buggy function and their expected values and types are as follows:
- `self_axes`: The expected value is `[Index(['a', 'b'], dtype='object'), RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)]`, which is a list.
- `other_axes`: The expected value is `[Index(['a', 'b'], dtype='object'), RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)]`, which is a list.
- `block.dtype`: The expected value is `dtype('int64')`, which is of type `dtype`.
- `block`: The expected value is an `IntBlock` object with specific parameters.
- `block.mgr_locs`: The expected value is a `BlockPlacement` object.

Based on the analysis of the failing test and the provided input/output variable values, a strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly process and compare the blocks. Sorting the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs would ensure that they are compared in a consistent manner.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By implementing the sorting based on dtype, mgr_locs, and the block type, this corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values.
