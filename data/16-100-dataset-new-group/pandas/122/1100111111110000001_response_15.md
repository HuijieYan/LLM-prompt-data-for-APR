The buggy function fails to correctly compare two dataframes and returns the wrong result. It seems that the issue is related to the implementation of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class, which is overriding the original `equals` function. This is causing a conflict and leading to the wrong comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the correct `equals` function is being called. To do this, we will modify the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class to call the original `equals` function from the Pandas `NDFrame` class.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... [other methods]

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        return super().equals(other)  # Call the original equals function from the NDFrame class
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two dataframes and return the expected result. It should pass the failing test.
