The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly identifying when two DataFrames are not equal, causing the failing test to incorrectly return `True is False`. This indicates that the `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False` when it should not. 

The issue is related to a problem in the comparison of blocks within the function. It is attempting to compare the blocks using the `equals` method, but the comparison logic is flawed. This is causing the function to incorrectly return `True`.

To address this issue, the comparison logic within the `canonicalize` function that compares the blocks of the DataFrames needs to be revised to accurately identify when the DataFrames are not equal.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return [
            (block.values, block.mgr_locs, block._consolidate_inplace())
            for block in blocks
        ]

    self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)
    return all(
        (block_vals, block_locs, block_consolidated) == (other_block_vals, other_block_locs, other_block_consolidated)
        for (block_vals, block_locs, block_consolidated), (other_block_vals, other_block_locs, other_block_consolidated)
        in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function accounts for the comparisons of block values, locations, and consolidated state in order to accurately determine whether the DataFrames are equal or not. This should address the issue and resolve the failing test case.
