The bug in the provided function is causing the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the blocks have identical values but different locations. This behavior is not consistent with the expected output, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

The potential error in the buggy function is the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize`. This sorting does not take into account the actual values of the blocks, and only considers the block type and manager locations, which leads to incorrect comparison results.

The cause of the bug is that the function only compares the block type and manager locations for sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` and does not consider the actual values of the blocks. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` for cases where the block values are identical but their locations are different.

To fix the bug, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should take into account the actual values of the blocks, in addition to the block type and manager locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, manager locations, and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block values in addition to the block type and manager locations for sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the actual values of the blocks, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
