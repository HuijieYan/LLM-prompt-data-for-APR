The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library. This function is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal.

The potential error locations in the `equals` function are:
1. In the comparison of the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. The consolidation of `self` and `other`.
3. The comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
4. Sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for unconsolidated blocks, which can lead to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we can first ensure that both `self` and `other` instances are consolidated before comparing them. Additionally, we can directly compare the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without sorting, as the order of the blocks should not affect the equality check.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, we first consolidate both `self` and `other` instances using the `_consolidate_inplace` method. Then, we perform the necessary equality checks based on the consolidated data, without sorting the blocks.

These changes should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function works as intended for comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
