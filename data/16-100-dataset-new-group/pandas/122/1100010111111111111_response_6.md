Based on the analysis of the buggy function, failing test, error message, runtime input/output values, expected input/output values, and GitHub issue, we can identify the cause of the bug. The issue arises from a comparison based on the order of the blocks, where the order of the blocks in the two dataframes affects the result of the equality check.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the blocks is not affected by their order.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Return a tuple of (type name, sorted(mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        return (block.dtype.name, sorted(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use the `canonicalize` function to generate a tuple consisting of the type name and a sorted list of `mgr_locs` for each block. This ensures that the comparison is not affected by the order of the blocks within the dataframes.

By implementing this fix, the corrected function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
