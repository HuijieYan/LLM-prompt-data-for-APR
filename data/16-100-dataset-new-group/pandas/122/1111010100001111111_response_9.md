```

In the corrected version of the `equals` function, the blocks from `self` and `other` are sorted and converted into dictionaries for direct comparison. This ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as equal. Additionally, the block ordering is taken into account, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.

This corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
