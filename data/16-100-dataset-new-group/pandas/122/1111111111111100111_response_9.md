The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class leads to incorrect comparison of DataFrames, causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to raise an assertion error.

The bug occurs when the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class compares two DataFrames. It incorrectly sorts and compares the blocks in the DataFrames, leading to an incorrect result.

To resolve the bug, we need to update the logic within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class to correctly compare the blocks in the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.to_dict()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.to_dict()
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method accurately compares the blocks in the DataFrames and returns the correct result.

Once this correction is implemented, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any assertion error.
