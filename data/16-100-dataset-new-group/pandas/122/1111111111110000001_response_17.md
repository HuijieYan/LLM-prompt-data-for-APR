The buggy function `equals` is attempting to compare two dataframes `self` and `other`, but it is using the `equals` method of the BlockManager class, causing it to return True instead of False when comparing df1 and df2 in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `equals` does not correctly handle the comparison of two dataframes and is returning True instead of False when comparing df1 and df2 in the failing test due to some internal logic related to the BlockManager class.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to properly implement the comparison logic for dataframes within the `equals` function of the BlockManager class. This would involve comparing all the elements of the dataframes to see if they are equal.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_blocks()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks()
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i])
        for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` function correctly compares the axes and blocks of the dataframes `self` and `other` to see if they are equal. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
