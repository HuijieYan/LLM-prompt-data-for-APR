The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of `BlockManager` objects. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

Upon analyzing the variables at the function's return, it seems that the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is not working as expected. The comparison method might be incorrectly identifying the blocks as equal due to the different ordering of the elements within the tuples.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using a custom key (canonicalize) that considers the dtype name and mgr_locs of the blocks. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly identified as equal.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly identify identical blocks with different locations and return the expected result. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
