The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This results in failing tests and does not satisfy the expected output values from the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for the possibility of identical blocks in different locations, resulting in the incorrect comparison and subsequent `True` return value. This bug is reflected in the failing test and the output variable values, which do not match the expected values.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to compare blocks based on their content rather than their location. This will ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the data within the DataFrames.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on their content
    self_block_values = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_values = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(value1, value2) for value1, value2 in zip(self_block_values, other_block_values)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function compares the block values within the DataFrames to determine equality, rather than relying on block location. This should address the bug and resolve the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
