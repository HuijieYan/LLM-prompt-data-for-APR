To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the sorting of the blocks. We also need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function considers the block order and location.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return block.mgr_locs.index

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we've updated the `canonicalize` function to `canonicalize_block` and now use the `mgr_locs.index` to sort the blocks properly. This should fix the issue with block comparison based on their location.

After making these changes, the `equals` function should now produce the correct output and pass the failing test. It will also address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
