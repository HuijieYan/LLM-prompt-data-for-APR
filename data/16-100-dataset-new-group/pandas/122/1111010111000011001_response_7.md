The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It first checks if the number of axes in both objects is the same. Then, it checks if all the axes are equal. After this, it consolidates the blocks of both objects and checks if the number of blocks is equal. Finally, it canonicalizes and sorts the blocks based on their dtype and `mgr_locs`, and checks if each block is equal to the corresponding block in the other `BlockManager` object.

The bug in the function could be related to the comparison of the blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects. The comparison does not account for the actual values in the blocks, but only their dtype and `mgr_locs`.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be to directly compare the data in each block of the two `BlockManager` objects, rather than just their dtype and `mgr_locs`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal` function is used to directly compare the data in each block of the two `BlockManager` objects. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual values within the blocks, rather than just their dtype and `mgr_locs`.
