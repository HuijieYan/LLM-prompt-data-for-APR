The issue here is that the `equals` method is not properly comparing the two BlockManagers `self` and `other`. It is not properly accounting for the fact that the `self` and `other` DataFrames may have their columns in a different order, which should not cause them to be considered unequal.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the item names from self and other into the canonicalization. This will allow the `equals` method to compare the DataFrames properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the two BlockManagers and produce the expected output for the failing test.
