To correct the buggy function, we need to address a potential issue with comparing the dataframes. The error message indicates that the original comparison is returning `True`, when it should be `False`. This suggests that the comparison logic is not working as expected.

Based on the failing test case and the expected values, it seems that the comparison of the dataframes is not being performed correctly. We need to investigate the logic for comparing the blocks within the dataframes and ensure that the comparison is done properly.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to revise the logic for comparing the blocks within the dataframes. This could involve iterating through the blocks and comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual values within the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Iterate through the blocks and compare them
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        block = self.blocks[i]
        oblock = other.blocks[i]
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```
This version iterates through the blocks and compares them one by one to ensure that the comparison is based on the actual values within the blocks. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test case.
