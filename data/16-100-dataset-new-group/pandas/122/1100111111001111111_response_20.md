## Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

Explanation:
1. The issue is caused by the incorrect canonicalization of blocks, resulting in the function falsely returning True even when the blocks have different locations.
2. The bug lies in how the `canonicalize` function was implemented. It needs to consider both `mgr_locs` and `dtype.name` to properly distinguish between blocks.
3. The `canonicalize` function's values were not effectively used to sort the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison. This caused the failing test to return True instead of False, which was not the expected output.
4. To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should calculate a unique tuple for each block using both `mgr_locs` and `dtype.name`. Then, the blocks should be sorted based on this tuple, ensuring accurate comparison and returning the expected output.
5. The corrected version of the function returns the expected output for the failing test.
