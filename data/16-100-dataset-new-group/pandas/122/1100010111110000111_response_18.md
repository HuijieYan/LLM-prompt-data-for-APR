The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail with the error message `assert True is False`. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" describes the problem and the expected output.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not handling the scenario where the data in the DataFrames is the same, but the order or location of the blocks is different. As a result, it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to properly compare the blocks in the DataFrames and account for different block order or locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` to properly compare the block locations. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be handled correctly.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".
