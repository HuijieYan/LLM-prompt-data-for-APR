The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is `equals`. This function is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` and check if they are equal. The bug reported in the GitHub issue is that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparisons of the `blocks` attribute and the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of the blocks does not take into account the difference in locations, causing it to incorrectly return `True` for DataFrame instances with identical blocks in different locations.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location information. Then, when sorting the blocks, we should sort based on the type name, followed by the location of the block. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account the block's location and correctly identifies differences.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the location information of the block. When sorting the blocks, the `canonicalize` function is used to sort based on the type name and then the location of the block, ensuring a correct comparison.

With these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly identify differences in DataFrame instances with identical blocks in different locations.
