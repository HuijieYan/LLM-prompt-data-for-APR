The bug in the `equals` function is likely to be caused by an issue when comparing the self and other `BlockManager` instances. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because `assert True is False`. This means that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The buggy function iterates through the blocks of the self and other `BlockManager` instances and compares the blocks. The issue is likely related to how the blocks are being compared or sorted.

To fix this bug, the comparison and sorting of the blocks need to be corrected to ensure that the function correctly identifies when the self and other `BlockManager` instances are not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._type, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block._type == oblock._type and block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, I removed the `.as_array.tolist()` method from `block.mgr_locs` to compare the `BlockPlacement` objects correctly. Additionally, I used `block._type` to refer to the block type for comparison.

Running the failing test should now pass with this corrected version of the function.
