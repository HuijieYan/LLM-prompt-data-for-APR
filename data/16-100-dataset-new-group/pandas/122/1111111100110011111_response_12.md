### Explanation

The bug occurs due to incorrect comparison of two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The bug causes the method to return `True` even when the two DataFrames have different block orders and locations.

The expected input values for the failing test case are two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, with the following values:
- `df1`: { "a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"] }
- `df2`: { "a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2] }

The expected output for this test case is `False`, as the two DataFrames are not equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix this bug, we need to update the `BlockManager.equals` method to properly compare the blocks of the two DataFrames. Specifically, the function should properly distinguish between blocks with identical data but different locations.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the block items
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define a function to produce a unique identifier for each block
    def block_key(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)
    
    # Check if all blocks are equal
    return all(
        block_key(self.blocks[i]) == block_key(other.blocks[i])
        for i in range(len(self.blocks))
    )
```

By incorporating a unique identification for each block using the `block_key` function, the `BlockManager.equals` method will be able to properly identify and compare blocks. This correction will resolve the bug and the failing test case.
