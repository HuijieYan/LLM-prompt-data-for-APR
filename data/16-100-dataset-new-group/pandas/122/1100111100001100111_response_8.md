The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return True in the case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue. This discrepancy is caused by the failure of the `equals` function to account for the block locations when comparing two BlockManager objects.

To address this bug, the `equals` function needs to consider the block locations when comparing the blocks of two BlockManager objects. This can be achieved by incorporating the block locations into the comparison process.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function now incorporates the block locations into the comparison process by sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the block locations, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

By applying this fix, the `equals` function should no longer incorrectly return True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.
