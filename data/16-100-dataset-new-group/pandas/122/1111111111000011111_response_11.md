The buggy function has a logical error when checking the equality of two DataFrames. It fails to account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. This causes the function to mistakenly return `True` in cases where it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the equals function to properly handle the case of identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we introduced a new `canonicalize` function that generates a unique representation for each block based on its values and locations. We then use this representation to compare the blocks when determining equality between the two DataFrames.

With this updated logic, the `equals` function should now properly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations and return the correct result.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
