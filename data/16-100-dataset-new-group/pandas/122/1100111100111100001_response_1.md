The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and block order are the same. It seems that the comparison logic is flawed, leading to the test failing with an error message indicating that `True` is being compared to `False`.

From the provided runtime values, it is observed that the input parameters `self` and `other` are instances of `BlockManager` with different data blocks and axis values. The variables `self_axes` and `other_axes` store the axes of the respective `BlockManager` instances.

The issue is likely occurring when comparing the blocks of `self` and `other` using the `canonicalize` function. The sorting of the blocks might not be comparing them correctly, leading to the incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the comparison logic for the blocks and the ordering. Specifically, ensure that the comparison of the blocks is based on their actual content, and the ordering is consistent and reflective of equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: tuple(str(b)))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: tuple(str(b)))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is replaced with an anonymous lambda function to compare the blocks based on their string representations. This ensures a consistent and accurate comparison of the blocks. The rest of the logic remains the same, with the comparison of axes and the consolidation of the blocks before comparison.
