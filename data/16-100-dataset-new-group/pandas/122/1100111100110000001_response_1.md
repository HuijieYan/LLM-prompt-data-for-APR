The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class in pandas' `managers.py` file. The function is intended to compare two BlockManager objects for equality, but based on the error message from the failing test, it seems that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False` when it should be False.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the sections where the comparison is being made between blocks and `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()`.

The bug seems to be caused by the comparison logic within the `equals` function. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects are not equal, but then it proceeds to call `_consolidate_inplace()` on both objects regardless of that condition. This can lead to discrepancies in the comparison process.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to restructure the comparison logic within the `equals` function. The function should first check for the condition where the lengths of the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects are not equal, and if that condition is met, it should return `False` without calling `_consolidate_inplace()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    # Consolidate blocks only when the lengths of the axes are equal
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `_consolidate_inplace()` method is called after ensuring that the lengths of the axes are equal. This should prevent any discrepancies in the comparison process.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now compare two `BlockManager` objects correctly and pass the failing test.
