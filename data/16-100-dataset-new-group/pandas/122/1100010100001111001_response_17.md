Based on the provided information, it seems that the buggy function is comparing two BlockManagers, self and other, for equality. The function first compares the axes of the BlockManagers and then proceeds to compare the individual blocks within the BlockManagers. However, there are issues with the equality check for the blocks and the sorting of the blocks based on their type and locations.

The bug occurs when comparing the individual blocks within the BlockManagers. This is evident from the runtime values where the blocks are not being compared correctly, leading to a false result. Additionally, the sorting of the blocks based on their type and locations can also lead to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, consider explicitly comparing the individual blocks within the BlockManagers and addressing any issues with the sorting of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```
