The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, as it's evaluating to `assert True is False`.

Looking at the `equals` function, it seems to be comparing the attributes of two `BlockManager` instances, but the way it compares the blocks seems to be incorrect. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks. However, the function `canonicalize` is redefined within the `equals` function, leading to confusion and potential errors.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function should be renamed to avoid confusion and define a new unique function for sorting the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # define a new function to sort the blocks
    def sort_blocks(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_blocks)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using a new unique function `sort_blocks` for sorting the blocks, the bug should be fixed and the function will return the expected result for the failing test case.
