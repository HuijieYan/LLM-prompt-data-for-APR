The bug in the equals function is that it incorrectly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations. The issue was reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The expected output was for the function to return False.

The bug occurs because the equals function does not correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations. The function compares the blocks in a sorted order, which can cause identical blocks with different locations to be incorrectly evaluated as equal.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the equals function to compare the blocks using a different approach that takes into account their actual content and not just their order.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
            if not self_block.equals(other_block):
                return False
        
        return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through each pair of blocks in self.blocks and other.blocks, and compare their content using the equals method of the Block class. If any pair of blocks are not equal, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True indicating that all blocks are equal.

This corrected version addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensures that the equals function correctly compares blocks with different locations.
