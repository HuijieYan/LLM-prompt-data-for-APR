### Potential Error Locations
1. Unhandled corner case for self and other having the same blocks but different locations.
2. Error in comparing the blocks of self and other due to different locations.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused because the function `equals` does not properly handle the scenario where self and other have the same blocks but different locations. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function compares the blocks of self and other, taking into account the locations of the blocks. Additionally, we need to check for any corner cases where self and other may have the same blocks but different locations.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the axes of self and other
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    # Consolidate self and other in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare the number of blocks in self and other
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Create a function to generate a canonical representation of a block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    # Sort the blocks of self and other using the canonical representation
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare each pair of blocks in self and other
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the bug should be fixed and the failing test case should pass.
