The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames to check for equality. The function calls the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks in the DataFrames and then compares them using the `equals` method of each block.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` has failed, and the comparison of the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` is returning `True`, which is unexpected.

The bug in the function is likely related to the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, and then the sorted blocks are compared using the `equals` method. However, since the `canonicalize` function is not correctly implemented, it may not be providing a consistent and expected sorting for the blocks, leading to the incorrect comparison and the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be revised to provide a proper sorting key for the blocks. Additionally, the comparison strategy between the sorted blocks should also be reviewed to ensure it accurately determines equality between DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Revised canonicalize function to properly sort the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.index.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function uses the values and index of the blocks to provide a consistent sorting key. Then, the sorted blocks are compared using the `equals` method to determine equality between DataFrames.
