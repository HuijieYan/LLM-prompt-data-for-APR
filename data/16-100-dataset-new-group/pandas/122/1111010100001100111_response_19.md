### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The incorrect comparison arises from the difference in the order of blocks based on their type name and manager locations, causing the function to return `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison of blocks by using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their manager locations before comparing them.

The corrected `equals` function now properly sorts the blocks based on their manager locations and then compares them for equality, ensuring that the comparison does not consider the order of the blocks.

By doing so, the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved, and the function should return the correct output as expected.
