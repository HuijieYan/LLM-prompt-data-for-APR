The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail, returning True when it should be False. The bug is likely located in the `equals` method because it incorrectly returns True when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function fails to properly compare blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect equality result. The failing test provides example DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that are expected to be not equal, but the `equals` function incorrectly returns True.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to compare blocks with different locations and return the correct equality result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.indexer)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, the blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function, taking into account the values and locations of the blocks to ensure accurate comparison. The `equals` method then iterates through the blocks to ensure that each block is equal to its counterpart in the other `BlockManager`.

With these modifications, the `equals` function will now correctly compare blocks with different locations and return the expected equality result in the failing test.
