The cause of the bug is that the equals() function is returning True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is due to the sorting of the blocks based on block type name and mgr_locs without considering the actual content.

To fix the bug, the equals() function should compare the content of the blocks rather than just the order and type. It should iterate through the blocks and compare their content using the equals() method.

Below is the corrected version of the equals() function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(other.blocks[i]) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)
    )
```

This correction ensures that the content of the blocks is compared using the equals() method, rather than relying on the order of the blocks.
