## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to occur due to the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. This ordering might lead to blocks with different values but the same dtype name and manager locations being considered equal. To fix this, we need to consider the block values as well when sorting the blocks.

We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block values in the sorting process. This will ensure that blocks with the same dtype, manager locations, and values are considered equal.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and values to ensure blocks with the same values
    # are treated as equal
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block values in the sorting process within the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that blocks with the same values, dtype, and manager locations will be considered equal. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
