To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue where the function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. The problem seems to be related to how the function handles the comparison of blocks.

After analyzing the failing test and the expected values, it's clear that the issue arises when comparing the blocks in the `equals` function. Since the DataFrame blocks are being compared based on type name and location, the function does not correctly handle the comparison of blocks with the same type but different locations.

Based on this analysis, a possible strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function to account for identical blocks with different locations. This could involve comparing the content of the blocks rather than their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    self_blocks_content = [b.values for b in self_blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [b.values for b in other_blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_block, other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the comparison now focuses on the content of the blocks rather than their locations. This change should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug, and the function should now correctly handle comparisons of blocks with different locations.

Applying this fix should ensure that the `equals` function correctly handles comparisons of identical blocks with different locations and returns the expected results.
