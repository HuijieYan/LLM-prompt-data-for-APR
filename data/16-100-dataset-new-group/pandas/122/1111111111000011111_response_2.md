The bug in the `equals` function is causing the `DataFrame.equals` method to wrongly return `True` for identical blocks with different locations, instead of `False` as expected. It is failing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of axes using `ax1.equals(ax2)` which may lead to unexpected behavior.
2. Sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which may not be correctly handling the comparison of blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of blocks and their locations, which results in incorrect return values for identical blocks with different locations. The issue reported on GitHub confirms that the `DataFrame.equals` method is not returning the expected output for identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to compare the blocks and their locations more accurately, and handle the sorting of blocks to ensure correct comparison.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare blocks and their locations
    self_blocks = [(block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in other.blocks]
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, we compare the values and locations of blocks directly to ensure accurate comparison. This should resolve the issue and make the `DataFrame.equals` method return the expected output for identical blocks with different locations.
