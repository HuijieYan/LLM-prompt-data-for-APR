The bug in the `equals` function seems to be occurring due to the ordering of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` not being compared correctly. The function sorts the blocks before comparing them, but it seems that it is sorting them in a way that does not correctly compare the blocks representing the DataFrames.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks and ensure that it compares the blocks in a way that accurately represents the data in the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function to compare blocks accurately
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), str(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now accurately compare the blocks representing the DataFrames and return the correct result for the failing test case.
