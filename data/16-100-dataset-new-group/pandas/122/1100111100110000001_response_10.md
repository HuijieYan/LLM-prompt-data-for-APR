The bug in the function `equals` is causing the test to fail with an AssertionError. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` if they are equal and `False` if they are not. The error message indicates that the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, with a specific comparison showing that `df1.equals(df2)` evaluates to `True`.

The bug in the function appears to be caused by an issue with sorting the blocks and the comparison of the sorted blocks. It seems that the order of columns in the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` is causing the comparison to fail even though the content is the same.

To fix the bug, the sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` needs to be revised to ensure that the comparison is not sensitive to the order of columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    # Update: Adjust the canonicalize function to sort blocks based on columns
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Sort blocks based on columns in the DataFrame
        return tuple(sorted(block.mgr_locs.items()))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the columns in the DataFrame, the comparison should no longer be sensitive to the column order and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
