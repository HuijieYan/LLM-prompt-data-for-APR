The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is causing the DataFrame.equals() method to wrongly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Iterating over `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` and comparing each block.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the blocks are identical but have different locations. This causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return True when it should return False.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.items)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.items)
        
        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we are sorting the blocks based on their items and then comparing the sorted blocks for equality.

With this fix, the `equals` function should work correctly and return False for the failing test case:

```python
def test_dataframe_not_equal():
    # see GH28839
    df1 = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"]})
    df2 = pd.DataFrame({"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]})
    assert df1.equals(df2) is False
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
