The bug in the equals function of the BlockManager class is causing the DataFrame equals method to return True for dataframes with identical blocks but different locations. The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" is comparing two dataframes df1 and df2 that have identical blocks but different locations, and the buggy function incorrectly returns True.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to consider the location of the block in addition to the type name. We can use the mgr_locs attribute of the block to achieve this. After modifying the canonicalize function, we need to update the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks to use this new canonicalize function and then compare the blocks based on the sorted order.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to consider block location as well
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
With this fix, the equals function will now accurately compare dataframes with identical blocks but different locations and return the expected result.
