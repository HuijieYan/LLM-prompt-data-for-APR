To fix the bug in the `equals` function, the issue appears to be with the comparison of the DataFrames itself. The ordering of the data in the DataFrames may affect the result of the `equals` method. Also, the canonicalization process may not be working as expected, causing the incorrect result.

One approach to fix the bug is to sort the DataFrames before comparison and use a different method to compare the blocks within the DataFrames. Another approach could be to use a different canonicalization process for the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Sort the DataFrames before comparison
    self_sorted = self.sort_index(axis=0).sort_index(axis=1)
    other_sorted = other.sort_index(axis=0).sort_index(axis=1)

    if not self_sorted.index.equals(other_sorted.index) or not self_sorted.columns.equals(other_sorted.columns):
        return False

    self_blocks = [(block.dtypes, block.values) for block in self._data.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block.dtypes, block.values) for block in other._data.blocks]

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

With this correction, the comparison of the DataFrames is more robust and should produce the correct result, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
