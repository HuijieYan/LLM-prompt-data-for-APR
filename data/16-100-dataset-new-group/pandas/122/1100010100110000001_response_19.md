The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two data frames and return True if they are equal, and False otherwise. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning True when it should be returning False.

The potential error is caused by the incorrect comparison of data frames due to the mismatch in data types. The comparison is performed by sorting and comparing the blocks, but the comparison should also consider the data types of the columns in the data frames.

To fix this bug and address the error, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the column data types in the comparison. Additionally, we should add a check to compare the column data types between the two data frames before performing the block comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, 
                block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
                [block.columns[i].dtype for i in range(len(block.columns))])

    # Compare data types of columns before canonicalize
    if any(col1.dtype != col2.dtype for col1, col2 in zip(self, other)):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function includes the comparison of column data types and ensures that the block comparison considers the data types as well. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
