The bug in the function seems to be related to the comparison of two DataFrames, df1 and df2, using the equals function. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, with the unexpected result of `assert True is False`.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the bug could be related to the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. The function first checks the lengths of the axes and then performs comparisons and sorting on the blocks within the DataFrames.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames, which may not be happening correctly due to sorting/ordering issues.

One strategy for fixing the bug could be to re-implement the comparison logic for the blocks within the DataFrames, ensuring that the comparison is done correctly and consistently, taking into account potential sorting and ordering issues.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Assume the corrected function is within the same class and has access to the necessary attributes.

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the function directly compares the blocks within the DataFrames to ensure that the comparison is performed correctly. It addresses the potential sorting and ordering issues that may have caused the bug.
