The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class and return `True` if they are equal. The function first checks if the axes of the two instances are equal in length and content and then proceeds to check if the blocks within the two instances are equal.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function for Case 1, we can see that the input parameters `self.axes` and `other.axes` contain the same values, and the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` also contain similar values, but in a different order. 

The issue arises when comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` for equality. The function sorts the blocks and then compares each block. However, the sorting does not take into account the actual content of the blocks, leading to an incorrect comparison.

To fix this bug, we can update the sorting criteria for the blocks to take into account the actual content of the blocks, rather than just their order.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block content, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and block content to ensure correct comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, repr(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the actual content of the blocks by using `repr(block.values)` as part of the sorting key. This ensures that the comparison is based on the content of the blocks rather than their order.

After updating the `equals` function with the correction, it should pass the failing test.
