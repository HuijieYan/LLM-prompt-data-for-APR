The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects and returns `False` if they are not equal based on several conditions. However, the current implementation is not correctly comparing the blocks and their corresponding columns, leading to the failing test.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different column order and content and then checks if `df1` is equal to `df2`. The test fails with the error message "assert True is False".

The potential error location is in the `equals` function's logic for comparing blocks and their order.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not take into account the column order and content when comparing the blocks.

To fix the bug, the logic for comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects needs to be updated to consider the column order and content.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare blocks by column order and content
    self_blocks = [self.blocks[i].values for i in range(len(self.blocks))]
    other_blocks = [other.blocks[i].values for i in range(len(other.blocks)]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are extracted from the `BlockManager` objects, and then they are compared based on column order and content using `np.array_equal`.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
