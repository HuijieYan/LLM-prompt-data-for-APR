To fix the bug, we need to address the issue with the `equals` function inside the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The `equals` function currently returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations, which is not the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of blocks inside the `equals` function does not take into account the location of the blocks. As a result, it considers blocks with different locations as equal, leading to the incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider both the type of blocks and their locations during comparison. We'll modify the `canonicalize` function to incorporate the location information and then use that for sorting and comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type, location, and dtype
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), repr(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes both the type and location of the block, along with the dtype. This ensures that blocks with different locations are no longer considered equal.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly identify blocks with different locations as unequal, as expected.

Once this corrected version of the `equals` function is implemented, it should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes without raising an assertion error.
