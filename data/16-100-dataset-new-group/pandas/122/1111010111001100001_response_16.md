The bug is likely to be caused by the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The bug happens when the equals() function is called on two DataFrames with the same data but in different orders. The bug is due to the implementation of the canonicalize() function, which is used to sort the blocks. The dtype.name attribute is comparing the data types of the blocks, and since the DataFrames have the same data but in different orders, they have different data types, which causes the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, we can modify the canonicalize() function to sort based on the data within the blocks instead of the data types.

Here's the corrected version of the equals() function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.values.reshape(-1))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the block values within the canonicalize() function, we ensure that the blocks are compared based on their data rather than their data types or order, which should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
