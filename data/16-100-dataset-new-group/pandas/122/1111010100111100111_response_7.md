### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The `equals` function compares the shape of axes and the blocks of the `self` and `other` objects.
2. It uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`.
3. There might be a problem with the comparison logic or the sorting logic in the `equals` function.

### Cause of the bug
The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, which means `df1.equals(df2)` returned `True` instead of `False`. This indicates that the comparison logic in the `equals` function is not working as expected. Additionally, the description from the GitHub issue also confirms the unexpected output for the `equals` method.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables, it can be seen that the `equals` function is comparing the shape of axes and the blocks of the `self` and `other` objects. The logic within the function involving the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function can also be a potential source of the bug.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Review the comparison logic in the `equals` function to ensure that it correctly compares the shape of axes and the blocks of the `self` and `other` objects.
2. Verify the sorting logic using the `canonicalize` function and check if it is correctly sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a hash of the combination of dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash((block.dtype.name, hash(block.mgr_locs)))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function uses a hash of the combination of dtype name and `mgr_locs` to sort the blocks, ensuring a consistent and reliable sorting order. Additionally, the comparison logic has been revised to correctly compare the blocks of the `self` and `other` objects.
