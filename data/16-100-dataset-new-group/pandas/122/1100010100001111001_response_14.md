There are a few potential issues in the buggy function:
1. The function is checking the equality of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` before consolidating the blocks in place, potentially leading to incorrect comparison of the block data.
2. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, but there may be unconsolidated blocks that can only be distinguished by the iteration order.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the blocks are consolidated before comparing them and potentially add additional logic to account for unconsolidated blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we consolidate the blocks in place before comparing the axes and blocks, which should ensure consistent comparisons and fix the identified bug.
