## Fixing the Bug

### Bug Analysis
The failing test shows that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion returns `True` when it should be `False`. This is a bug in the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The function compares the internal blocks of two `BlockManager` instances and returns `True` when it should return `False`.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, the issue is likely with the comparison done inside the `equals` function, specifically with the comparison of the sorted internal blocks of `self` and `other`. 

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the comparison of the sorted internal blocks (`self_blocks` and `other_blocks`) in the `equals` function. The sorting is based on the result of the `canonicalize` function, which extracts the block's dtype and manager locations and uses them to sort the blocks. This could lead to situations where the same blocks, with the same values, end up in different positions in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, causing the `equals` function to falsely return `True`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the comparison inside the `equals` function must be revised to ensure that the order of the internal blocks does not affect the comparison result.

Based on the GitHub issue and the analysis, I suggest modifying the comparison part of the `equals` function to compare each internal block in `self_blocks` with the corresponding block in `other_blocks` without relying on their order. This can be achieved by looping through both lists and comparing the blocks without sorting them based on `canonicalize`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks individually without relying on their order
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version avoids sorting the internal blocks and instead directly compares each block in `self_blocks` with the corresponding block in `other_blocks`.

This fix should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
