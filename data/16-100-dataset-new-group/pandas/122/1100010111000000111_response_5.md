The issue stems from the `equals` function in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. It incorrectly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is not the expected behavior.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, and the comparison of the sorted blocks using the `all` function.

The cause of the bug lies in the fact that the `equals` function does not correctly account for identical blocks with different locations, resulting in an incorrect return value when comparing two DataFrames.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include additional information that distinguishes blocks with the same `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` from each other. Additionally, the comparison of sorted blocks should be modified to ensure that the equality check is performed accurately, considering the distinguishing information.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the issue should be resolved, and the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass as expected.
