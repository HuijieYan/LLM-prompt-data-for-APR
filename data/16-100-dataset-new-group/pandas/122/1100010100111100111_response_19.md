The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This issue has been identified and reported on GitHub.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is the way it compares the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples.

The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function used to sort `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparison. This function sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which might not accurately represent the contents of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we should consider comparing the blocks directly without altering their order.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames and return the expected output. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
