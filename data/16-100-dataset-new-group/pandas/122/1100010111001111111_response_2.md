## Correction

The issue arises because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is not properly handling the manager locations, causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered as equal. To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for sorting the blocks.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `canonicalize` function now considers both the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` for sorting the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are distinguished. This correction addresses the bug reported and will resolve the failing test case, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the posted GitHub issue.
