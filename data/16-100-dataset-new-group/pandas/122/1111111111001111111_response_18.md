The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with different locations. The current implementation of the function does not take into account the locations of the blocks, causing it to return incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function needs to account for the block locations when comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the block locations by using `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes()` to generate a unique representation for each block. This ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are properly distinguished.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct results, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
