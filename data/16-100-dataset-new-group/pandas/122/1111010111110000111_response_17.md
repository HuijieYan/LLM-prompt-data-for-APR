## Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library. It is meant to compare two instances of a `BlockManager` and return true if they are equal. However, there are issues with identifying the axes and blocks when comparing two `BlockManager` instances, leading to incorrect results.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrame instances, `df1` and `df2`, and then tries to assert that `df1.equals(df2)` is equal to `False`. However, this test fails, producing the error message `assert True is False`. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" provides a clear description of the problem. The user encountered the issue when trying to compare two DataFrames using the `equals()` method, and the method incorrectly returned `True` instead of the expected `False`.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the `equals` function are:
1. Determining the axes of the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances.
2. Consolidating the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances in place.
3. Sorting and canonicalizing the blocks for comparison.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is likely related to the misidentification of axes and blocks during the comparison process. When comparing two `BlockManager` instances, the function may not be accurately determining the axes and blocks, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should accurately identify the axes and blocks of the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances in order to perform a correct comparison. Care should be taken to ensure that the comparison considers the block type and locations to avoid false positives.

## Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = [tuple(ax) for ax in self.axes]
    other_axes = [tuple(ax) for ax in other.axes]
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version of the `equals` function, the axes of the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances are correctly identified using tuples for comparison. The consolidation of the instances is performed before comparing the blocks to ensure accurate results. The `canonicalize` function ensures that blocks are correctly ordered for comparison based on their type and locations.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
