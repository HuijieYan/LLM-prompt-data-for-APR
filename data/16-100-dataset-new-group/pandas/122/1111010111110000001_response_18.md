The buggy function "equals" is part of the BlockManager class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The failing test is `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is triggering an AssertionError.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not comparing the DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` properly. The function is not handling mixed-type DataFrame comparison correctly, which leads to incorrect results, triggering the assert statement. 

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be updated to compare the DataFrames at a more granular level, taking mixed data types into account.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    for i, block in enumerate(self_blocks):
        if not block.equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This updated version of the `equals` method compares each block in the BlockManager one by one to ensure all the internal blocks are equal. This approach takes mixed-type DataFrames into account and addresses the bug.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass without triggering an AssertionError.
