The buggy function `equals` in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` appears to compare two dataframe objects `self` and `other`. The error message in the failing test from `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, resulting in `assert True is False`.

The input parameters and their corresponding values and types seem to be correct at the function's return. However, the error message suggests that the comparison of the dataframes `df1` and `df2` is not returning the expected result.

The cause of the bug might be related to how the dataframe objects `self` and `other` are being compared, specifically when sorting the blocks. It seems that the comparison of the block data is not occurring as expected, leading to the incorrect assertion.

To fix the bug, it might be necessary to review the comparison process of the dataframe blocks and potentially consider an alternative approach for comparing and sorting the blocks.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x)))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x)))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the main modification is the sorting of the blocks. It uses the `hash(tuple(x))` to sort the blocks based on their values, which ensures that the comparison is consistent and accurate.
