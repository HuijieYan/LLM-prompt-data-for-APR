The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which is sorting based on the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs`. However, the comparison should consider the order of the blocks as well.

To fix the bug, instead of just comparing the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, we should compare each block in the same order. This can be achieved by using the index to access each block for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```
