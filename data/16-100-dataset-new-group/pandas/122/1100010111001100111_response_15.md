### Analysis
The buggy `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects and checks if their axes and blocks are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provides two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that are expected to be unequal, but the `equals` function wrongly returns `True`.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly compare the blocks in the `BlockManager`, resulting in the wrong outcome. This is due to the use of the `canonicalize` function that sorts and combines the block type name and manager locations to compare the blocks, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic for comparing the `BlockManager` blocks. Instead of using the `canonicalize` function, a direct comparison of the blocks should be performed to determine their equality.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the comparison of `BlockManager` blocks is done directly, without using the `canonicalize` function. This change should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function return the correct result for the failing test.
