To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue where the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two different DataFrames.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic inside the `equals` function. The function is comparing two DataFrames, `self` and `other`, and checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, the comparison is returning `True` when it should return `False`, indicating that the two DataFrames are not equal.

One potential cause of the bug could be the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` arrays using the `canonicalize` function. There might be a mistake in the sorting logic or the `canonicalize` function itself, causing the comparison to produce incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic inside the `canonicalize` function and the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. It's important to ensure that the sorting and comparison logic accurately reflect the equality of the DataFrames based on their contents.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check equality of sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we review and modify the `canonicalize` function to properly represent the dtype and mgr_locs of the blocks. Then we sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` arrays using the updated `canonicalize` function, and finally compare the sorted blocks.

This should address the bug and ensure that the comparison correctly reflects the equality of the DataFrames.
