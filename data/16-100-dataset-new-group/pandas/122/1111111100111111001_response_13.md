The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the way it handles the comparison of the input parameters `self` and `other`. The function is supposed to compare the two BlockManager instances based on their axes and blocks, but it seems to be sorting the blocks incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the axes and blocks of `self` and `other` correctly. It should also handle the sorting of the blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should correctly compare the axes and blocks of `self` and `other` BlockManager instances. This should address the failing test case and ensure that the function returns the expected values.
