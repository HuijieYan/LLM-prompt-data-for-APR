The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file demonstrates that the `equals` method is not returning the expected result when comparing two DataFrames.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. In the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`
2. In the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`
3. In the canonicalization of blocks and comparing each block with the corresponding block in the other BlockManager object.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of two BlockManager objects, leading to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is done correctly. This may involve revisiting the logic for comparing axes, sorting and comparing blocks, and ensuring that the canonicalization process is accurately capturing the differences between blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are first comparing the axes of the two BlockManager objects. Then, we consolidate the blocks in both BlockManager objects and compare them by sorting and canonicalizing them in a way that captures their type and location. Finally, we iterate through each pair of blocks to ensure that they are equal.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes as expected.
