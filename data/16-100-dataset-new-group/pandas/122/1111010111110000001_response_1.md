The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The `equals` function is designed to check for equality between two instances of `BlockManager`. The function appears to be failing when comparing DataFrames with different column types. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assert statement in the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is failing.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function does not handle the case where the DataFrames have different column types. The function is comparing the blocks in a way that is not able to handle the different types in each DataFrame. As a result, the comparison returns `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to take into account the different column types in the two DataFrames and adjust the comparison logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), hash(block.val.item()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By converting the dtype to string and hashing the values, we can ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account both the type and values of the columns.

After making the above correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
