The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to failing tests and a GitHub issue.

The bug is related to the comparison logic in the `equals` function, where it incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, which expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be corrected to consider the block locations when comparing identical blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and locations for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the comparison now takes into account the block locations when sorting the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

This should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
