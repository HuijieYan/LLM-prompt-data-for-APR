The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the inconsistency in the order of the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. The function fails to compare the blocks in a consistent and canonical manner, causing it to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks in a consistent way before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version, the blocks of `self` and `other` are sorted using the `canonicalize` function before performing the comparison, ensuring a consistent order for comparison.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
