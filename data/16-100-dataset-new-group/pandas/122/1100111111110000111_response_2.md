The issue with the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function where "mgr_locs" is being called on the block instance. Instead, it should be called as "block.mgr_locs."

To fix the bug:
1. Make sure to call "mgr_locs" as "block.mgr_locs" in the `canonicalize` function.
2. Update the `equals` function to accurately compare the two dataframes based on their block order and data type.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())  # Updated the line to use block.mgr_locs

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should accurately compare the dataframes based on their block order and data type, resolving the issue in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
