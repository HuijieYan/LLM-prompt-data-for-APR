The bug in the function `equals` is likely due to the incorrect comparison of axes and blocks of two different `BlockManager` instances, leading to a failing test.

The cause of the bug includes:
1. The comparison of axes using `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not be valid for all cases, especially when the axes are not in the same order.
2. The comparison of blocks using `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may not produce the correct result due to different block ordering.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison method for axes and blocks, ensuring that the comparison considers all possible scenarios of axis and block ordering.

Additionally, there is an extra `canonicalize` function defined in the `BlockManager` class, which is not used within the `equals` function. This needs to be removed or appropriately integrated into the comparison logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks by the actual index values
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison uses a consistent ordering of axes and blocks for accurate comparison.

With this fix, the failing test case should pass.
