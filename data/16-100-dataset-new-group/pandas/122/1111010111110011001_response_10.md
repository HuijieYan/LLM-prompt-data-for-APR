The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager instances and checks if they are equal, but it has a bug that causes it to fail the test case. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks within the BlockManager instances due to an incorrect canonicalization process.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function used for ordering the blocks is not correctly handling the types and index labels within the blocks. This results in incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks, leading to a False assertion in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization process needs to be updated to properly account for the data types and index labels within the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks
    # which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version includes the correct handling of data types, locations, and values within the block to ensure proper canonicalization and comparison. This version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
