Based on the provided information, the bug appears to be related to the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class, specifically with how the method compares the blocks and their locations. The issue raised in GitHub also aligns with the expected behavior of the `equals` method.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the expected values and types of the variables, it seems that the bug may be related to the `canonicalize` function. The way it's sorting the blocks based on the combination of the type name and `mgr_locs` might be causing incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, one strategy would be to modify the `canonicalize` function to effectively sort and compare the blocks based on their type and values. After that, checking whether the `equals` method returns the correct result would be necessary.

Below is the corrected version of the given buggy function. The `canonicalize` function has been modified to correctly sort and compare the blocks based on their type and values:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to sort and compare blocks based on type and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        if hasattr(block, 'attrs') and 'direction' in block.attrs:
            return (block.attrs['direction'], block._values)
        elif hasattr(block, '_block_type') and block._block_type == 'categorical':
            return (block.categories, block.codes)
        else:
            return block._values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now return the expected boolean result when comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class. After implementing this fix, the failing test cases as described in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
