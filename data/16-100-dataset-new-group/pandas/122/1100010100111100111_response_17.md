The buggy function `equals` is comparing the `axes` and `blocks` of two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal. However, the bug is causing the comparison to fail, leading to an incorrect output.

Upon analyzing the failing test case, we can see that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is due to the incorrect comparison of axes and blocks within the function.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly sorts the blocks based on their type name and locations. This causes the sorted blocks to be different from the original blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the sorting logic to ensure that the original order of blocks is maintained while performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            type(block).__name__,
            tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_slice() for block in self.blocks).index(block.mgr_locs),
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects and return the expected output.
