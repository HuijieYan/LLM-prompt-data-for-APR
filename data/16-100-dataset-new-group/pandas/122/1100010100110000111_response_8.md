The bug in the provided `equals` function is that it fails to correctly identify and compare identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function so that it considers not only the block's type name and `mgr_locs`, but also its shape. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified and compared.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, shape, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should correctly identify and compare identical blocks with different locations. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub, and the failing test should pass.
