The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return True for two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations. This bug is identified in the GitHub issue with title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations." The provided failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` also confirms the issue, with the AssertionError indicating that `assert True is False`.

The cause of the bug is in the `equals` function within the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. It is failing to correctly compare the blocks of two DataFrames due to the logic used for sorting and comparison.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to ensure that it correctly compares the blocks by considering their content, instead of just the ordering. This can be achieved by implementing a new logic for canonicalization that takes into account the content of the blocks.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a unique identifier for content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(tuple(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the `hash` of the values in the blocks to uniquely identify their content. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks, rather than just their ordering.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
