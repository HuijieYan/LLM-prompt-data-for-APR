The bug in the `equals` function is causing the `DataFrame.equals` method to return True in cases of identical blocks with different locations, when it should be returning False.

The specific issue can be found in the function `equals` from the `managers.py` file of pandas. The problematic part is in the sorting of blocks, where unconsolidated blocks (like Categorical) can be distinguished only by the iteration order, leading to a wrong comparison result.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to modify the `canonicalize` function by including the position of blocks in the sorting key along with the type name. This will allow the correct comparison of blocks even if they have different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and the positions of the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, id(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now handle the comparison of blocks with different locations correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
