## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality.

Potential Errors:
1. The comparison of the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not accurately represent equality.
2. There is a call to the `_consolidate_inplace` method which may modify the instance state.
3. Sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function may not produce the correct order.

Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` method might be due to incorrect comparison and sorting mechanism. It's also possible that the `_consolidate_inplace` method modifies the instance state in a way that affects the comparison.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Validate the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` for equality.
2. Avoid modifying the instance state by not calling `_consolidate_inplace` within the `equals` method.
3. Use a more reliable sorting mechanism that accurately represents the equality check.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if any(not ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we've replaced `all` with `any` in the axes comparison part to accurately represent the inequality. We've also removed the calls to `_consolidate_inplace` and modified the `canonicalize` function to compare `block.values` instead of `block.dtype.name`. These changes should address the potential errors and fix the bug.
