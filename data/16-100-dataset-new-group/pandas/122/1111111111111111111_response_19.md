The buggy issue is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing two DataFrames, which is resulting in unexpected True values. This is causing the failing test with the error message `assert True is False`.

The root cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is comparing the DataFrames based on the block order, leading to inconsistent results when the block locations are different even though the content is the same.

To resolve this issue, the `equals` function needs to be updated to compare the DataFrames based on their content rather than their block locations. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on their content and then comparing them.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = []
    other_blocks = []

    for b in self.blocks:
        if b.values.shape[0]:
            self_blocks.append(b.values)
    for b in other.blocks:
        if b.values.shape[0]:
            other_blocks.append(b.values)

    self_blocks = np.concatenate(self_blocks, axis=1)
    other_blocks = np.concatenate(other_blocks, axis=1)

    return np.array_equal(self_blocks, other_blocks)
```

With the corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved. The corrected function compares the blocks of the DataFrames based on their content, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly recognized as equal.
