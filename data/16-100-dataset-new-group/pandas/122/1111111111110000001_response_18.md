1. The buggy function is trying to compare two dataframes using the `equals` method. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is calling the `equals` method on two dataframes and expecting it to return False, but the test is failing.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
   - The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the criterion defined in the `canonicalize` function.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not defined correctly, which is leading to incorrect sorting of the blocks and subsequent comparison.

4. To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to correctly represent the data blocks, so that it can be used for sorting and comparison.

5. Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modify the canonicalize function to correctly represent the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.values,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array,  # Use the actual block values and locations for sorting
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test.
