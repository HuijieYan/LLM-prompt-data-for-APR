The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method. This is causing the test to fail, as the comparison of two DataFrames is returning `True` instead of `False`, according to the error message.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. The comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
3. The `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly compare the DataFrames and does not handle the comparison of two DataFrame objects properly, leading to unexpected comparison results.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `equals` method compares the DataFrames correctly. Additionally, we need to handle the sorting of blocks in a way that ensures consistent comparison results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not all(self.axes[i].equals(other.axes[i]) for i in range(len(self.axes))):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks in a consistent manner for comparison
    def sort_key(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.shape, block.mgr_locs.index)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)
    
    return all(
        self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self.blocks))
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare two DataFrames and return the expected result.
