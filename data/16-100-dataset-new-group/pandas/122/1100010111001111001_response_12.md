The bug in the `equals` function occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not properly handle the management locations of the blocks. This causes the comparison to fail, leading to the incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function properly handles the management locations of the blocks and compares them correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs to properly handle management locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now correctly handles management locations, ensuring that blocks are compared properly. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
