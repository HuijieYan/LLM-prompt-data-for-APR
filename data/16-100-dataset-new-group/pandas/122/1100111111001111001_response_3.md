The bug in the given function seems to be in the `canonicalize` function that is nested inside the `equals` function. The purpose of this `canonicalize` function is to sort the blocks based on their data type names and manager locations.

The bug in the code causes the `canonicalize` function to not be called correctly, which leads to incorrect comparison and sorting of the blocks. The comparison of values for `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is producing incorrect results due to this.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be properly defined and called within the `equals` function, and the sorting operation should be applied correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    # Sort the blocks using the canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is properly defined and called within the `equals` function, and the sorting of the blocks is done based on the data type names and manager locations. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
