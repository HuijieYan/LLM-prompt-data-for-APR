The issue with the `equals` function is that it is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` in the failing test case provided. This is due to the sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` which does not take into account the order of the columns in the DataFrames.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to include the order of the blocks as well. Additionally, the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` should be sorted based on the entire tuple, including both the type name and the block values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes `block.values` to consider the order of the values. Additionally, both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are sorted based on the entire tuple produced by `canonicalize`.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return the correct value for the failing test case and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
