The buggy code is failing to correctly compare two dataframes and returning an incorrect result. The issue seems to stem from the canonicalize function, which may not be correctly identifying identical blocks within the dataframes.

To fix the bug, we can revise the canonicalize function to utilize a more consistent comparison method for the data blocks. We can also remove the unnecessary _consolidate_inplace function calls as they do not seem to serve a purpose in this context.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we sort the blocks based on their values, which allows for a consistent comparison between the dataframes.

This correction should address the issues in the buggy function and make it pass the failing test.
