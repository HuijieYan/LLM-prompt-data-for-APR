To fix the buggy function, we need to address the issue with the DataFrame.equals() function returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations. 

The bug occurs when comparing two DataFrames using the equals() function, as shown in the failing test function test_dataframe_not_equal(). The expected result is False, but the buggy implementation does not return the correct result.

The bug is caused by the canonicalization of block order which does not take into account the location of the blocks. This causes identical blocks with different locations to be incorrectly considered as equal.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to include the block's location in its canonicalization. This will ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are not incorrectly considered as equal.

Here's the corrected version of the equals() function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block's location in the canonicalize function, we ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly distinguished. This addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and ensures that the equals() function returns the expected result for the failing test case.
