The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of two objects, leading to incorrect boolean returns.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to correctly compare the axes and blocks of the two objects.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version of the function compares the axes and blocks of the two objects and returns True if they are equal, and False otherwise.
