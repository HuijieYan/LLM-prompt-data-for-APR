The buggy function `equals` of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file has a couple of issues. The first issue is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the class and once inside the class. This leads to ambiguity and can cause unexpected behavior when calling the `canonicalize` function. The other issue is that the comparison logic inside the `equals` function is not taking into account the dtype and mgr_locs of the blocks.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to remove the duplicate `canonicalize` function and make sure that the comparison logic inside the `equals` function considers the dtype and mgr_locs of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.

Note: The provided `canonicalize` function might require further modification based on the actual implementation of the `Block` and `BlockManager` classes.
