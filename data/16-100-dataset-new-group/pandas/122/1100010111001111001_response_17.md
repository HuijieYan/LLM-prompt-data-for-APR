The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two BlockManager objects `self` and `other`. The function first compares the axes of the two BlockManagers, then the individual blocks within the BlockManagers. However, the bug is likely occurring in the comparison of the individual blocks.

The function's logic for comparing the blocks is using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their data type and locations. However, this logic does not consider the actual content of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for comparing the blocks to consider their actual content, rather than just their data type and location.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we directly compare the blocks based on their content using the `equals` method, rather than sorting and comparing based on data type and location. This should properly address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
