The bug in the `equals` function of the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module is causing incorrect behavior in the `DataFrame.equals` method. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it actually returns `True`. The error message indicates that the issue is related to the dataframe not being equal when it is expected to be.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is incorrectly determining the equality of two dataframes based on the location of the blocks. The bug causes the equality comparison to return `True` incorrectly due to it not considering the values and index positions of the dataframes.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to properly compare the values and index positions of the blocks in the dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check index and data equality for each block
    equal_blocks = []
    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.index.equals(other.blocks[i].index) or not block.values.equals(other.blocks[i].values):
            equal_blocks.append(False)
        else:
            equal_blocks.append(True)

    return all(equal_blocks)
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function properly checks the index and data equality for each block in the dataframes. This will ensure that the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file passes, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
