The bug in the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is causing it to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This issue has been identified in the GitHub repository with the version details provided.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are identified as follows:
1. The comparison logic within the `equals` function is not correctly handling identical blocks with different locations.
2. The `canonicalize` function is present twice in the code, once within the class and once outside the class, which can lead to confusion and potential issues.

The cause of the bug is due to the faulty comparison logic that is not considering the different locations of identical blocks. It is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to account for the different locations of identical blocks. Additionally, the redundant `canonicalize` function declaration outside the class should be removed to avoid confusion.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())  # Fixed the function call
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `canonicalize` function is defined within the `equals` function, avoiding confusion with the external declaration.
2. The use of `as_array` method is corrected to `as_array()` when calling it within the `canonicalize` function.

With these corrections, the `equals` function should now accurately compare DataFrames and return the expected output, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub repository.
