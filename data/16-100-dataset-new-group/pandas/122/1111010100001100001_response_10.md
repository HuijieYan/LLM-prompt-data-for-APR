The buggy function 'equals' appears to assess the equality of two BlockManager objects. However, there are issues with comparing the axes and blocks of the two objects. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two objects, and then sorts and compares the blocks in a way that does not guarantee correct results.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Comparing the axes of the two BlockManager objects using the 'equals' method of each axis.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the comparison of axes and blocks properly, leading to incorrect results when assessing the equality of two BlockManager objects.

To fix the bug, the function should:
1. Properly compare the axes of the two BlockManager objects, ensuring that matching axes are compared correctly.
2. Improve the sorting and comparison of blocks to ensure that the comparison is reliable and returns the correct result.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, the axes of the two BlockManager objects are compared using a loop to ensure that all axes are properly compared. Additionally, the sorting and comparison of blocks have been improved to ensure the correct comparison of the blocks.
