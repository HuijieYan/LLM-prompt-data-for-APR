The buggy function `equals` is failing to correctly compare two dataframes and is not returning the expected output. This is evident in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` where it is asserted that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it is not.

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, as well as the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. There might be issues with how the blocks are being sorted and compared. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the axes and blocks of the two dataframes. This results in incorrect comparisons and the function returning incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should be rewritten to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is done correctly and consistently for both dataframes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not all(self.axes[i].equals(other.axes[i]) for i in range(len(self.axes))):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In this corrected version, the comparison of axes and blocks is done with a more rigorous and consistent approach, ensuring that the function accurately identifies the equality of the two dataframes. This should address the bug and make the function return correct results.
