The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of BlockManager and return True if they are equal, and False otherwise. However, the function fails to properly compare the internal blocks, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of axes using the `equals` method may not work as intended.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function may not produce the expected order for comparison.

The cause of the bug is primarily due to the improper handling of the internal blocks in the `equals` function. This leads to incorrect comparison results when comparing two instances of `BlockManager`, as shown in the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

To fix the bug, we suggest revising the `equals` function to properly handle the comparison of internal blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate self and other BlockManagers
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare internal blocks
    for (s_block, o_block) in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not s_block.equals(o_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

After applying this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` instances, resolving the bug and making the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
