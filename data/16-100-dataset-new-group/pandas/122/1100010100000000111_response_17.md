The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. The reported issue on GitHub is that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in cases where the DataFrame contains identical blocks with different locations. The user expected the function to return `False` for the provided test case, but it incorrectly returned `True`, indicating a bug in the implementation.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method in the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent comparison of sorted blocks using the `all` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function first sorts the blocks of DataFrames and then compares them using the `equals` method. However, if the blocks are identical but located differently within the DataFrames, the comparison should return `False`. This behavior is not handled correctly in the current implementation.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the information about the block locations and then compare this information when sorting and comparing blocks. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs,
    # and block values to handle blocks with identical values in different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block values along with the type name and block locations. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations will not be considered equal when comparing DataFrames, resolving the reported bug.
