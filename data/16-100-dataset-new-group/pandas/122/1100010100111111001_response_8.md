The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is causing the assertion error.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the internal blocks of the BlockManager objects. This is evident from the incorrect return value, as well as the runtime input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly compares the internal blocks of the BlockManager objects.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
    
    return True
```

The corrected function compares the axes and the blocks of the two BlockManager objects. If any of the comparisons fail, the function returns `False`. If all comparisons pass, the function returns `True`. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
