The buggy function "equals" is a method of the "BlockManager" class in the pandas library. This method is used to check if two BlockManager objects are equal to each other. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The "self._consolidate_inplace()" and "other._consolidate_inplace()" may not be functioning as expected, possibly causing a bug when comparing the blocks.
2. The sorting of blocks using the "canonicalize" function may not be working correctly, leading to incorrect comparison results.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect comparison of blocks and the ordering of blocks. This can result in the "equals" method returning incorrect results when checking the equality of two BlockManager objects.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that the "consolidate_inplace" function works as expected and correctly sorts the blocks before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate blocks for both self and other BlockManager
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._typ, block._mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._typ, block._mgr_locs))

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the "consolidate_inplace" function is called for both "self" and "other" BlockManager objects before comparing the blocks. Additionally, the sorting of blocks has been adjusted to use the type and manager locations, ensuring the correct order of blocks for comparison.
