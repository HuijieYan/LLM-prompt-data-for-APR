The bug in the equals function of the BlockManager class appears to be related to how it compares the blocks from two instances. The function iterates through the blocks and checks if they are equal by comparing corresponding blocks from each instance.

One potential cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly compare the blocks by their type and metadata. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing the blocks from different instances.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to properly identify and order the blocks based on their type and metadata. This will ensure that the blocks are compared correctly in the equals function.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the equals function includes a modified canonicalize function that properly identifies and orders the blocks based on their type and metadata. This ensures that the blocks are correctly compared when checking for equality.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass.
