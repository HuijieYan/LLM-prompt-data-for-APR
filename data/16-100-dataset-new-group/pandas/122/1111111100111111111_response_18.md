Based on the information provided, the bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The failing test case showed that when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, it returned `True` when it was expected to return `False`. This indicates that the comparison logic inside the `equals` method is incorrect.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. It seems that the comparison is not taking into account the order of the blocks, which results in incorrect equality checks.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not properly comparing the internal blocks of the `BlockManager`. It fails to check the equality between the blocks in a way that accounts for potential differences in block order. This leads to incorrect results when comparing two DataFrames.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to modify the comparison logic so that it considers the order of the blocks when checking for equality. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on a representative key, such as the block's data type and location, before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the comparison logic now sorts the blocks before comparing them, ensuring that differences in block order are accounted for when checking for equality.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread by ensuring that the `equals` method returns the correct result when comparing two DataFrames.
