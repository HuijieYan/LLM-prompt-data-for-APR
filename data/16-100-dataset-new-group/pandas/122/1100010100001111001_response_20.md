The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. It first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects. If the axes are not equal, it returns `False`. Then, it consolidates the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects and compares the consolidated blocks.

The bug likely arises from the comparison of the block objects. The `canonicalize` function tries to sort the blocks based on their data type name and manager locations, but it may not be correctly handling certain cases, causing incorrect sorting of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to handle block comparisons more accurately and reliably.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we compare each block directly using the `equals` method of the block objects. This ensures that the comparison is done accurately and consistently for all block types.
