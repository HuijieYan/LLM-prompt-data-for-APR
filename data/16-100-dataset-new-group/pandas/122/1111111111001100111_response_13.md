The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas.core.internals.managers` file has an issue. Based on the failing test, it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` for two DataFrames that are not equal. 

The cause of the bug is as follows:
The function compares the axes of two DataFrames and then the blocks of the two DataFrames without considering the order of the blocks. This can lead to a situation where two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations would incorrectly be deemed equal.

To fix the bug, the function should consider the order of the blocks and compare them in a way that ensures consistency, regardless of their locations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.indexer))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, the `canonicalize` function now uses `tuple(block.mgr_locs.indexer)` to ensure the consistency of the block order. Additionally, the `sorted` function is used to sort the blocks based on this canonicalized representation before comparing them.

This fix should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function correctly identifies the equality of DataFrames, taking into account the order of blocks.
