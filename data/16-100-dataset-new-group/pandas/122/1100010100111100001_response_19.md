The buggy function appears to be the equals method of a class, and it is designed to compare two instances of the class. However, it seems to be returning incorrect results. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is not passing. This suggests that the equals method is returning True when it should be returning False, causing the test to fail.

The buggy function compares the axes of two instances, then consolidates both instances in place, compares the length of their blocks, and finally compares each block using a canonicalization process. The issue with the function may arise from incorrect comparison logic in these steps.

To fix the bug, we should review the comparison logic in each step and ensure that it accurately compares the two instances and returns the correct result. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function handles the given data types properly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    # Compare the lengths of axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Compare each axis
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False
    
    # Consolidate both instances in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare the length of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare each block
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

After applying these changes, the corrected function should now return the correct result when comparing two instances, and the failing test should pass.
