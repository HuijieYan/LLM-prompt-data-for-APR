### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class of the `pandas` library is used to compare two block managers to check if they are equal. The function is currently not working as expected, as indicated by the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.

### Potential error locations:
1. The comparison of the number of blocks in `self` and `other` may not be accurate.
2. The sorting of the blocks using a custom function `canonicalize` may lead to incorrect comparison results.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly, even when the blocks have different locations but the same content. This is not the expected behavior and is causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Reconsider the comparison logic of the number of blocks in `self` and `other`.
2. Review the sorting logic used to canonicalize the blocks to ensure correct comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly for equality
    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

The corrected version directly compares each block in `self` with the corresponding block in `other` for equality. This ensures that differences in block locations are accounted for, and the function returns the correct result.

This version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
