The issue in the buggy function is caused by the incorrect comparison of two DataFrames using the `equals` method. Specifically, the bug occurs when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, which should return False but incorrectly returns True.

The cause of the bug lies in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. In this method, the comparison of the blocks is incorrectly ordering them using a sorting key derived from the block's dtype and mgr_locs. This leads to blocks with identical data but different locations being considered equal, resulting in incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the sorting key for the blocks needs to be modified to include more information that distinguishes blocks with identical data but different locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses both the block's values and mgr_locs to create a unique sorting key. This ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.

With this correction, the `equals` method should now return the correct comparison results and pass the failing test.
