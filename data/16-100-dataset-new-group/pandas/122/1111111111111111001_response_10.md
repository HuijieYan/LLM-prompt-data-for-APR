The bug in the given function `equals` is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return `True` instead of `False`. 

The bug seems to be related to the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the result of the `canonicalize` function. This function is not implemented properly, and it causes the blocks to be sorted incorrectly, leading to the incorrect comparison.

The fix for this bug would involve correcting the implementation of the `canonicalize` function. It should return a tuple containing the type name and the locations of the blocks, and also fix the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on this modified `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
By correcting the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple of necessary block information and sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on this information, the function now correctly compares the blocks and returns the expected result.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
