Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be with the `equals` method in the `managers.py` file. The `equals` function is not properly comparing the values in `self` and `other` DataFrames, leading to a `True` return value when it should be `False`. The problem is also described in the GitHub issue, where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be updated to correctly compare the DataFrames without considering block locations. Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Compare data blocks without considering their locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function will iterate over the blocks in both `self` and `other` DataFrames and compare their values without considering their locations. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.

By replacing the existing `equals` function in `managers.py` with the corrected version provided above, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass. Additionally, the GitHub issue mentioned should also be resolved.
