The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two instances of the BlockManager class and return True if they are equal, and False otherwise. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` is checking if the `equals()` function correctly identifies that two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal. The test fails with the error message `assert True is False`, indicating that the `equals()` function is returning True incorrectly.

The cause of the bug in the `equals()` function is that the comparison logic inside the function is not correctly identifying the inequality between the two BlockManager instances. This problem arises from the incorrect implementation of the canonicalization of blocks before comparison.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization of the blocks should be based on the combination of the type name and manager locations for each block. This will ensure that blocks with the same type name and manager locations are sorted consistently before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate inplace to ensure blocks are sorted similarly
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the `equals()` function should correctly identify the inequality between the two BlockManager instances and pass the failing test.
