The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class seems to be related to the comparison between two DataFrame objects. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, and then checks if `df1` equals `df2`. However, the expected output is `False` because the two DataFrames have different data.

The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method first compares the axes of the two BlockManagers (`self` and `other`) and returns `False` if the lengths are different. Then, it proceeds to compare the blocks of the two BlockManagers. If the lengths of the block arrays are different, it again returns `False`. Then, the method sorts the blocks in both BlockManagers and compares each pair of blocks using the `equals` method of the blocks (which is an internal method specific to the implementation of Pandas).

Looking at the failing test, it seems that the bug occurs because the two DataFrames have different data, but the `equals` method compares the blocks in a way that is not aligned with the DataFrame comparison logic. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting blocks also seems to be correct.


### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug is occurring because the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is not correctly aligning with the DataFrame comparison logic. To fix this bug, the `equals` method should directly compare the values of the DataFrames rather than comparing the internals blocks. This can be done by introducing a comparison between the underlying data within the `equals` method.

Moreover, the current `equals` method uses the `self.blocks` attribute, and the `other.blocks` attribute to compare the blocks of the two DataFrames. This might be causing an issue, and direct comparison of DataFrame's values instead of this block-wise comparison can potentially resolve the bug.

The solution should aim to compare the data of the DataFrames directly.

### The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

This corrected implementation directly compares the values of `self` and `other` BlockManagers. It uses the `equals` method of the `values` attribute to compare the underlying data of the two DataFrames. This approach aligns with the expected behavior of the `equals` method, making the corrected version more reliable and consistent.
