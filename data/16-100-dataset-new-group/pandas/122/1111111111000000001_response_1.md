The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The purpose of the function is to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Bad comparison logic due to improper handling of the `axes`
2. The use of the `canonicalize` function is incorrect

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly comparing the `BlockManager` objects for equality. The comparison of `axes`, consolidation, and canonicalization of blocks are not performed correctly, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be revised to correctly handle the axes, consolidation, and canonicalization of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    # Consolidate inplace for self and other BlockManagers
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures the comparison of `BlockManager` objects for equality by correctly handling the axes, consolidation, and canonicalization of blocks. It should pass the failing test mentioned above.
