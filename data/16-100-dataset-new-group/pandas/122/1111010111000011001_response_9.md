The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two instances of the class and return `True` if they are equal and `False` if they are not. However, it is failing to do so and causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The issue lies in the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` within the function. The function is sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, but it is not handling the case where the blocks are consolidated. This results in incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle consolidated blocks differently when sorting and comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        if block.mgr_locs is None:
            return (block.dtype.name, [])
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function handles the case where `mgr_locs` is `None`, and the `sorted` function will sort the blocks accordingly.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and satisfy the expected input/output values.
