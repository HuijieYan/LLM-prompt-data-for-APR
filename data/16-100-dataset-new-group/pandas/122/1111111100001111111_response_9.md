The bug in the `equals()` function is causing it to return incorrect values in certain cases where the blocks have identical content but are in different locations. This results in the incorrect `True` value being returned instead of the expected `False`. 

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the comparison of the blocks based on their location, rather than their actual content. The comparisons are based on the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` value, which fails to account for identical blocks in different locations.

To fix this issue, the comparison logic should focus on the actual content of the blocks rather than their location. This can be achieved by comparing the values within each block, and only considering the location as a tiebreaker when the content is identical.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the function compares the content of the blocks directly using the `equals()` method for each block, without considering their location. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
