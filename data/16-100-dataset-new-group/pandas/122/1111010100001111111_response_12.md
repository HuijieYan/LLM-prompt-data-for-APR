After analyzing the buggy function, its relationship with the `BlockManager` class, and the runtime and expected input/output values, it appears that the bug is with the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparing them for equality.

The bug is causing `DataFrame.equals()` to incorrectly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This can be seen in the GitHub issue provided, where a simple test using `df3.equals(df4)` is expected to return `False` but instead returns `True`.

The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function not properly taking block locations into account when comparing the blocks for equality.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be adjusted to consider the block locations in addition to the block type (dtype). This will ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` method call within the `canonicalize` function has been replaced with `tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array)` to create a hashable representation of the block locations. This allows the blocks to be properly sorted and compared for equality, taking block locations into account.

With this correction, the `DataFrame.equals()` function should now behave as expected and return `False` for the provided test case and for similar cases where blocks have identical data but different locations.
