## Bug Explanation:

The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly returns `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations, whereas it should return `False`. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected output of the function.

The `equals()` function is intended to compare two DataFrame objects and return `True` if they are equal and `False` if they are not. However, the current implementation contains a bug that causes it to return an incorrect result.

The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()` demonstrates the bug by comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values but the same structure, and the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

The cause of the bug within the `equals` function may be related to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which can lead to incorrect comparisons of blocks with different locations.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, the sorting mechanism in the `equals` function needs to be updated so that blocks with different locations are handled correctly. Additionally, the comparison logic needs to be refined to ensure that the function returns the appropriate result based on the structural equality of the DataFrames.

### Updated Fix for the Buggy Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The fix involves using a combination of block IDs and their locations to ensure that identically structured blocks with different locations are treated as distinct. This will ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result when comparing DataFrames with blocks in different locations but equivalent values.
