The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The purpose of this method is to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function.
3. The comparison of individual blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` does not produce the desired result. The error message indicates that the comparison returns `True` when it should return `False`, which causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug:
1. Use a different approach to compare the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
2. Ensure that the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the custom `canonicalize` function is accurate.
3. Verify that the comparison of individual blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is correct.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with the original function by properly comparing the blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. Additionally, it avoids the use of the `canonicalize` function for sorting. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` method work as intended.
