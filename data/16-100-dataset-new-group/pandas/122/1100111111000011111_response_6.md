The buggy function fails to correctly compare two DataFrames and returns the wrong output. This is due to the way it handles and orders the blocks within the DataFrames. The function compares the blocks within the DataFrames in a way that can lead to incorrect results, as it does not account for differences in the locations of identical blocks.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames, accounting for potential differences in block locations.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = {canonicalize(block) for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {canonicalize(block) for block in other.blocks}
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

The corrected version of the function uses a set to store the canonicalized versions of the blocks, which includes the block's locations and values. By comparing the sets of canonicalized blocks, the function ensures that differences in block locations are correctly accounted for when determining if the DataFrames are equal.
