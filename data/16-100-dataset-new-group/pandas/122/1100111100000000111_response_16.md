The buggy function equals(self, other) has a bug that causes it to wrongly return True in the case of identical blocks with different locations. The issue is related to the incorrect comparison of blocks in different locations, leading to a false positive result.

The bug seems to be occurring in the comparison part of the function, where it tries to compare blocks in different locations using the canonicalize function. The ordering of blocks and their comparison does not consider the actual values and their locations within the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the comparison to consider the actual values and their locations within the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        other_block = other.blocks[i]
        if not block.equals(other_block):  # Compare the actual values in the blocks
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through each block, compare the actual values in the blocks, and return False if any blocks are found to be different. This approach ensures that the comparison considers the actual values and their locations within the blocks.
