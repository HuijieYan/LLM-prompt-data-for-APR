The bug in the `equals` function appears to be related to the comparison of two dataframes using the `equals` method. The problem stems from the comparison of blocks within the dataframes, where the comparison does not account for the different locations of identical blocks.

The `equals` function starts by comparing the `self_axes` and `other_axes` of the two dataframes. If their lengths are not equal, it returns False immediately. Then, it checks whether all axes are equal. After that, it consolidates the blocks within both dataframes, then compares the number of blocks. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks within the dataframes.

The issue seems to be related to the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their type names and locations. However, the function fails to account for identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the data within the blocks as well, to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been replaced with a lambda function inside the `sorted` function, which uses both the block data and their locations to sort and compare the blocks. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the comparison correctly identifies unequal blocks.

This should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the `equals` function returns the expected results.
