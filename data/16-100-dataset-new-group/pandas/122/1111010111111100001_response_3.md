The bug in this case seems to be related to the comparison of the contents of the two DataFrames. The function `equals` compares the data blocks of two `BlockManager` instances, along with their labels and indexes. However, the comparison does not consider the specific data types of the blocks, which causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` for the two DataFrames in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the comparison within the `equals` function should explicitly check for the equality of the values within the data blocks, taking into account their specific data types.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    ) and self._equal_data(other)
```

In the corrected version, a new method `_equal_data` is called to compare the data within the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass.
