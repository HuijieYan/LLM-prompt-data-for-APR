The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. Since these are being sorted based on the result of `canonicalize` function, the comparison may not yield expected results due to the order of blocks.

To fix this bug, a strategy is to directly compare the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` rather than using the `all` function. This ensures that the comparison is based on the order of the blocks after sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now creates a tuple combining the `mgr_locs` and `dtype.name`. The sorting is then based on this combination. The final comparison is done using `self_blocks == other_blocks` to ensure that both are identical in order and contents after sorting. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
