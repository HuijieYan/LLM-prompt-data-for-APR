Given the input variable value and type, and the expected variable values and types, and the GitHub issue, the bug in the buggy function can be explained. The issue is that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is evident from the expected output provided in the GitHub issue, where the user expected the `equals` function to return `False` for the given input data frames.

The cause of the bug lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function. The function does not fully account for identical blocks with different locations when comparing the data frames, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be modified to correctly handle identical blocks with different locations. Specifically, the sorting mechanism for the blocks needs to be adjusted to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly deemed as unequal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    keys = set()
    for block in self.blocks:
        key = (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
        keys.add(key)
    for block in other.blocks:
        key = (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
        if key not in keys:
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, a set of keys is created to represent the blocks, and these keys are used for comparison. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
