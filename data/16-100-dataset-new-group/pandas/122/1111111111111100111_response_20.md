To fix the bug in the buggy function, we need to address the issue of DataFrame.equals() wrongly returning True in the case of identical blocks with different locations. Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be related to the process of canonicalizing the block order and comparing the blocks in the equals() function.

The cause of the bug can be identified by analyzing the input parameters and runtime values, along with the failing test and the corresponding error message. The failing test 'test_dataframe_not_equal()' compares two DataFrames df1 and df2 using the equals() function and expects the result to be False. However, the test fails with the AssertionError indicating that the actual result is True.

The bug appears to be related to the way blocks are being canonicalized and compared in the equals() function. The process of sorting the blocks using the 'canonicalize' function might not be effectively distinguishing between blocks with different locations but identical content. This leads to the function incorrectly returning True even when the blocks have different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the process of canonicalization and comparison of blocks in the equals() function. We should ensure that the comparison takes into account both the type and location of blocks to accurately determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the equals() function should properly handle the comparison of blocks and return the expected result. This should resolve the issue of DataFrame.equals() wrongly returning True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.
