The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail. 

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is causing the `equals` function to return `True` when it should return `False`. This is happening because the function incorrectly compares blocks in different locations as being equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks and consider their locations when determining equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    return True
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function properly compares the blocks and considers their locations when determining equality.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
