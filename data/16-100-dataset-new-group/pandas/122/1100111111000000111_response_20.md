The buggy function `equals` is not comparing the dataframe blocks correctly, resulting in a wrong output when comparing two dataframes.

The bug is caused by the flawed canonicalize function that is sorting the blocks based on a combination of block type and the location of the block. This sorting is incorrect, leading to a wrong result from the `equals` function.

To fix this bug, the canonicalize function needs to be adjusted to sort the blocks based on their content and not their type and location. Also, the comparison between self and other dataframes should be based on their block content rather than their order and type.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = np.array([blk.values for blk in self.blocks])
    other_blocks = np.array([blk.values for blk in other.blocks])

    return np.array_equal(self_blocks, other_blocks)
``` 

This corrected version compares the content of the blocks, ensuring that the dataframes are considered equal when their content is the same, regardless of their order or type. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
