The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which is defined twice, once in the class and once at the file level itself. This causes confusion and the wrong conversion of block data for comparison. This is further confirmed by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, where two DataFrames with different data are incorrectly identified as equal, resulting in a failed assertion.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the redundant `canonicalize` function and ensure that the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is done with the correct block data. We should also ensure that the comparison accounts for the data within the blocks and not just their order.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks data instead of their order
    return all(
        pd.array_equal(self._b.get_values(), other._b.get_values())
        for self._b, other._b in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

Now with this corrected version, the `equals` function should correctly compare the block data and return the expected output for the failing test.
