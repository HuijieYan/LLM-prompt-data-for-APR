The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The buggy function seems to be comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` to check if they are equal. The error message indicates that the comparison is resulting in `True` instead of `False`, which is unexpected.

The cause of the bug could be due to the comparison of the data blocks within the DataFrames. Since the bug occurs with the `equals` method, the issue likely lies with how the data blocks are being compared in the function.

The strategy for fixing the bug should involve reviewing how the data blocks are being sorted and compared within the `equals` method. It's important to ensure that the sorting and comparison logic is correct to accurately determine if the two DataFrames are equal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been modified to use `block._values` instead of `block.dtype.name` for sorting the blocks. Additionally, the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` has been replaced with just `block.mgr_locs` for comparing the blocks.

This should address the bug and ensure that the comparison of data blocks is done correctly, resolving the issue with the `equals` method.
