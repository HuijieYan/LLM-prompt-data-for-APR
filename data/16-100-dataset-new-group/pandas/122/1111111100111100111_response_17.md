## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `equals()` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail, returning `True` instead of `False`. The bug arises when comparing two DataFrames and their underlying blocks, leading to an incorrect result.

The inputs to the function are self (BlockManager) and other (BlockManager), containing axes and blocks. The function iterates over the axes and blocks to check for equality. However, due to the incorrect comparison logic in the function, the expected result is not obtained.

The bug is caused by a flaw in the comparison logic within the function, where the comparison of blocks does not take into account their actual content but rather their order and data type, leading to an incorrect result.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals()` function needs to be revised. Instead of comparing blocks based on their order and data type, the comparison should focus on the actual content of the blocks.

Additionally, the canonicalize function is declared twice, once within the class and once outside the class. This is unnecessary and potentially confusing. The buggy canonicalize function within the class should be removed.

## Corrected Code
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Comparison of block content instead of order and data type
        return all(
            self.blocks[blk_loc].equals(other.blocks[blk_loc])
            for blk_loc in range(len(self.blocks))
        )
``` 

This corrected code fixes the bug by comparing the actual content of the blocks within the `equals()` function. It iterates over the blocks and compares their content using the `equals` method, providing the expected comparison of DataFrames. Additionally, the redundant canonicalize method within the class has been removed.

With these fixes, the `df1.equals(df2)` test is expected to pass, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
