The bug in the `equals` function causes it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is evident from the failing test case, where `df1.equals(df2)` incorrectly returns `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The root cause of this bug is the sorting of blocks based on a custom key function `canonicalize`, which is used to determine the equality of blocks in different DataFrames. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple based on the block's dtype name and mgr_locs, which might differ if the blocks are identical but have different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to ensure that it properly handles identical blocks with different locations. One approach could be to accurately compare the blocks without relying on their locations, ensuring that the equality comparison is based on the contents of the blocks rather than their order.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks without relying on their locations
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this revised version, we compare the blocks by sorting them based on their values rather than their locations. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks, allowing the `equals` function to correctly identify differences in blocks regardless of their locations.

By implementing this change, the `equals` function should now return the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
