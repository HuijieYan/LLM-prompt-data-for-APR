The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to produce the error message `E       assert True is False`. This means that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, causing the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the two DataFrames `self` and `other`. This is evident from the error message, which shows that `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is not passing.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be modified to correctly compare the two DataFrames by their axes, blocks, and values. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
  
    self_blocks = []
    other_blocks = []
    for block in self.blocks:
        self_blocks.append(block.values)
    for block in other.blocks:
         other_blocks.append(block.values)
    
    return np.array_equal(self_blocks, other_blocks)
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the two DataFrames and pass the failing test.
