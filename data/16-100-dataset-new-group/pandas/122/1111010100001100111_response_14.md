The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances and checks if they are equal. Based on the GitHub issue, the problem is that the function is returning True when it should be returning False.

The bug appears to be related to the logic within the `equals` function, particularly in sorting and comparing the blocks. The function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances, then consolidates them in place. After that, it compares the lengths of the blocks, and then sorts the blocks before comparing them.

The bug seems to arise from the sorting and comparing of the blocks. It is likely that during the sorting process, the blocks with similar content but different locations are not being properly compared, leading to the function incorrectly returning True when it should be False.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the sorting and comparing logic for the blocks to ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are properly handled.


```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on content and location
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    # Compare the sorted blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we sort the blocks based on both their values and their locations. This ensures that even if two blocks have the same content but are located differently, they will be properly compared. Then, we iterate through the sorted blocks and compare them. If any pair of blocks are not equal, the function returns False. If all blocks are equal, the function returns True.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and effectively compare the `BlockManager` instances for equality.
