The buggy function has an issue with comparing DataFrame objects using the equals method. The problem arises when comparing identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The main issue with the buggy function is the comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks. The function incorrectly returns True when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the comparison needs to be modified to consider the order of the blocks and the locations.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and 
    # then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks (say, 
    # Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer_items())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and (block.mgr_locs.indexer_items() == oblock.mgr_locs.indexer_items())
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the comparison now considers the location of the blocks along with the order, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
