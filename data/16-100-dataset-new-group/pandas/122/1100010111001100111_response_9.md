The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of DataFrames `df1` and `df2` in the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The function is expected to return `False` because the two DataFrames are not equal, but it might be returning `True` due to a bug.

After analyzing the code, the bug appears to be in the comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames.

The cause of the bug may be due to the function incorrectly identifying the blocks in the DataFrames as equal, even when they have different locations. This can lead to an incorrect comparison result and causes the failing test.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic within the `equals` function. We should ensure that the comparison of blocks in the DataFrames takes into account their locations as well, not just their content.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the content and the location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes the block content and the location into account, ensuring that it accurately represents the blocks in the DataFrames. The sorting and comparison logic are also updated accordingly to consider both content and location, which should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
