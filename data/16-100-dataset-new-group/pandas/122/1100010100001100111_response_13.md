The issue with the equals function is that it returns True even when the blocks have the same values but in different locations. The root cause of this bug is that the function does not consider the different locations of the blocks when comparing them. The function only checks if the number of axes and the blocks are the same, but it does not take into account the actual content within the blocks.

To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the actual content of the blocks while taking into account the different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks and their contents
    for block in self.blocks:
        found_match = False
        for oblock in other.blocks:
            if block.equals(oblock):
                found_match = True
                break
        if not found_match:
            return False
    return True
```

In this corrected version, we added a loop to compare each block in self.blocks with all the blocks in other.blocks. If a matching block is found, we move on to the next block. If a matching block is not found, we return False. This ensures that we are comparing the actual contents of the blocks while also taking into account their locations.
