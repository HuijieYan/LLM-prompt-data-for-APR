To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the comparison logic between the blocks in `self` and `other`. The bug issue on GitHub clearly describes the problem that occurs when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. Based on the test case and the issue description, we need to ensure that the comparison takes into account the actual values and their locations within the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block)
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we replace the previous `block.dtype.name` with `block.values` and include the `mgr_locs` in the canonicalization process to ensure that the comparison takes into account the data values and their locations within the blocks.

This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
