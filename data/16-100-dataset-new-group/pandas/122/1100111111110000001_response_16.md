The buggy function `equals()` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file is causing the test to fail. The function is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. However, it is not implemented correctly and does not handle the comparison of different data in the same columns.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals()` function does not correctly compare the content of the two DataFrames. It fails to handle the case where the values in the columns are different, leading to the assertion error in the test.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize()` function should be modified to consider the data type and values of the block, and the comparison of the blocks should be based on the block content rather than just its attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.index)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version:
- The `canonicalize()` function now considers the content of the block, including both values and index, when sorting the blocks.
- The comparison of the blocks is based on their content using the `equals()` method.

With this correction, the `equals()` function should now pass the failing test.
