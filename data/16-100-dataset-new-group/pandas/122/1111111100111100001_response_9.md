The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. It appears that the comparison is being incorrectly performed, leading to the failing test.

The bug likely stems from the sorting and comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a custom key function `canonicalize`. It seems that the implementation of the `canonicalize` function is not correct, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be implemented correctly to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared accurately.

Additionally, there is a duplicate `equals` function defined in the `BlockManager` class, which could be causing confusion. The duplicate function definition could lead to the wrong function being called, resulting in the incorrect comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.get_values().__class__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.get_values().__class__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version uses a lambda function as the key to properly sort the blocks by class type and `mgr_locs`. This should address the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
