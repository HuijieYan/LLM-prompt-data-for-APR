## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` could be causing an issue if the axes are not being correctly compared.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function may not be correctly identifying identical blocks with different locations.
3. The comparison of each block using a list comprehension may not be accurately identifying whether the blocks are equal.

## Cause of the bug
The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but the buggy function is likely returning `True` due to the sorting mechanism using the `canonicalize` function. This indicates that the bug lies in the sorting mechanism used to compare blocks and may not accurately identify identical blocks with different locations.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` correctly identifies whether the blocks are equal, regardless of their locations. This may involve modifying the sorting mechanism and the comparison of the blocks.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs._slice, block.dtype.name))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs._slice, block.dtype.name))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` has been modified to use a lambda function to sort based on the combination of the block's slice and dtype name. This should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.
