The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is located in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is meant to compare two objects and determine if they are equal. However, the function contains an error that causes it to fail when comparing two dataframes, as shown in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` located in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison of the two dataframes using the `equals` method, which does not handle the comparison of dataframes with different data types in a robust manner.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is comparing the dataframes directly without handling the cases where the data types are different, which causes the comparison to fail for dataframes with different data types.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be modified to handle the case where the data types are different and still provide an accurate comparison of the dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is modified to convert the type of the block to a string to handle different data types. Additionally, the corrected version now uses `str(type(block))` to handle the comparison for different data types.

This corrected version of the `equals` method should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
