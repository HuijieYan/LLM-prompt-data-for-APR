Since the bug seems to be related to DataFrame.equals() wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations, we need to focus on the buggy function `def equals(self, other)`. 

The cause of the bug is likely in the comparison of blocks that are sorted differently. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but the buggy function is returning `True` in this case.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to also include the index of the block, so that blocks that might have the same dtype and mgr_locs but are differently located will be considered unequal. Then, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` function accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and the index
    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), index)

    self_blocks = [(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)]
    other_blocks = [(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(other.blocks)]

    # Sort the blocks using the canonicalize function
    # along with the index to ensure that differently located
    # blocks are considered unequal
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))

    # Compare the sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return the expected result for the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
