The buggy function provided above is the `equals()` method within the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. 

1. Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is called with the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` from `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing.

2. Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are the block comparison and sorting logic.

3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the `equals()` method to return `True` despite the DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` having different values. This is due to the sorting and comparison logic used to compare blocks.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `equals()` method to ensure that it correctly compares the blocks and returns the expected result for data frames with different values at corresponding locations.

5. Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `equals()` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # iterate through each block and compare them
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that each block in the data frames is correctly compared and returns the expected result when data frames have different values. This change aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
