The bug in the equals function is likely causing the test_dataframe_not_equal test to fail. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of two BlockManager objects, where their axes and blocks are being compared for equality. Based on the provided runtime values, it looks like the comparison logic may be incorrectly identifying the two DataFrames as equal when they are not.

To fix the bug, one approach would be to revisit the logic used to compare the axes and blocks within the equals function. Since the function compares whether the axes are the same and whether the blocks are equal, it may require more specific comparison logic to correctly identify differences.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    for axis in self_axes:
        if not self.get_slice(axis, axis).equals(other.get_slice(axis, axis)):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version revises the comparison logic by verifying that the axes are of the same length and then proceeding to compare the values within each axis to ensure equality. If there are any differences found, it returns False, indicating that the two BlockManager objects are not equal.
