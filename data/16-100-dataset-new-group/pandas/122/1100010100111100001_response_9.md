The issue with the `equals` function is that it returns `True` even when the dataframes are not equal. This is due to the sorting of the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables, which might not accurately reflect the equality of the dataframes.

To fix this bug, we should compare the blocks directly, without sorting them. We can modify the function to compare the blocks one by one and return `False` if any pair of blocks are not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(other.blocks[i]) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)
    )
```
