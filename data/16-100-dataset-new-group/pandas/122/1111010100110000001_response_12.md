The buggy function "equals" is a method within the BlockManager class of the pandas library. This method is used to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, with the assertion message showing that it is evaluating `True is False`.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. The comparison of blocks using the "equals" method.
2. The sorting and canonicalization of blocks to compare.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison within the equals method is not handling the comparison of DataFrames correctly, leading to the assertion failure. The "equals" method needs to be modified to handle DataFrames comparison properly.

To fix the bug, the "equals" method should be modified to handle DataFrame comparison by extracting the underlying data from the DataFrames and comparing them element-wise.

Here's the corrected version of the "equals" method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        block1 = self.blocks[i]
        block2 = other.blocks[i]
        
        # Check if the block shapes are the same
        if block1.shape != block2.shape:
            return False
        
        if isinstance(block1, (IntBlock, FloatBlock)):
            # Extract underlying data and compare
            if not np.array_equal(block1.values, block2.values):
                return False
        elif isinstance(block1, ObjectBlock):
            # Extract underlying data and compare
            if not block1.values.equals(block2.values):
                return False
        else:
            return False  # Unsupported block type
    
    return True
```

This corrected version of the "equals" method iterates through the blocks and compares them based on their types. For numeric types, it uses NumPy's `np.array_equal` to compare the underlying values, and for object blocks, it uses the `equals` method to compare the underlying values. Unsupported block types result in a False return to indicate non-equality.
