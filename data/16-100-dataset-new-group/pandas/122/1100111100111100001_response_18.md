The buggy function `equals` is intended to check whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal. However, it seems to be failing, based on the provided failing test. The error occurs when comparing the sorted blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

The problematic section of the code is the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The issue may be coming from the `canonicalize` function, where the `mgr_locs` attribute is not handled correctly.

The `canonicalize` function returns a tuple with the block's data type name and `mgr_locs`. The issue is that `mgr_locs` is called using the `.as_array` attribute, but without parenthesis to actually call the method, making `as_array` an attribute instead of calling it as a method.

To fix this issue, simply add the parentheses `()` to the `as_array` method, which will properly call the method and return the list of positions as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Fix the issue by properly calling the as_array method
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the failing test should now pass, as the `mgr_locs` attribute is called properly and returns the correct list of positions.
