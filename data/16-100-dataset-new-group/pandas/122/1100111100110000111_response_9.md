### Bug Analysis:
The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is causing the test `df1.equals(df2)` to fail and leading to the assertion error shown.

The actual issue is related to the incorrect comparison of DataFrames due to inconsistent block locations.

### Error Locations:
The issue is occurring within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. Specifically, the problem is in the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function to sort them.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the way the `canonicalize` function is used. It does not take into account the possibility of unconsolidated blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the block locations when sorting the blocks. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as different.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and block values to consider block locations
    def canonicalize_with_locs(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_with_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_with_locs)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been renamed to `canonicalize_with_locs`, and it now considers block values and locations in addition to the block type when sorting the blocks. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are sorted and compared correctly.
