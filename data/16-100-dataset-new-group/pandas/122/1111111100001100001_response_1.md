The buggy function compares two BlockManager objects `self` and `other` by checking the equality of their axes, then consolidating them and comparing their blocks. The bug seems to be related to the consolidation and comparison of the blocks.

The bug likely occurs in the comparison of blocks, as the `canonicalize` function appears to be incorrect. Also, the `_consolidate_inplace` function is called before the comparison, which might lead to the inconsistent comparison results.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly represent the block order using a tuple combining the type name and then `mgr_locs`.
2. Remove the call to `_consolidate_inplace` for both `self` and `other` as it may change the internal block structure and lead to incorrect comparison results.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been fixed to properly represent the block order, and the call to `_consolidate_inplace` has been removed to ensure consistent comparison results.
