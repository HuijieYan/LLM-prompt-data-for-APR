## Bug Explanation
The `equals` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the bug arises when the function incorrectly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations, which should instead return `False`. This is due to the way the function canonicalizes and compares the blocks, which does not account for the possibility of identical blocks being in different locations within the `BlockManager`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to modify the comparison process to consider the unique locations of the blocks as well, ensuring that identical blocks in different locations are not incorrectly deemed as equal.

## Code Improvement
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Sort the blocks by canonicalized identifier
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Additionally check for matching lengths to handle identical blocks in different locations
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the sorted and canonicalized blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
By sorting and canonicalizing the blocks based on their type's name and location identifier, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly compared, preventing the bug from occurring.
