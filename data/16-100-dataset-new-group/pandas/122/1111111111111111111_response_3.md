The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of the self and other blocks. The comparison needs to account for the location of blocks within the memory manager.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks in a way that accounts for their locations within the memory manager.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to canonicalize the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        if isinstance(block, ExtensionBlock):
            return (block.make_block_same_class(), block.mgr_locs.to_array().tolist())
        else:
            return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.to_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks, taking into account their locations within the memory manager. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test case.
