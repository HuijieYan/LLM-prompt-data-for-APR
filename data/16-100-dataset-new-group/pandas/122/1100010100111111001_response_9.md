The bug in the function is causing a failing test, where `df1.equals(df2)` is expected to return `False` but it returns `True`. 

The bug seems to be in the part of the function where it compares the blocks of the two BlockManagers. There might be an issue with sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which could lead to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the sorting and comparisons of the block items are working correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_slice().start)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I made sure to sort the BlockManagers using the same key (type name and start of the slice) to ensure consistency in comparisons. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result for the failing test.
