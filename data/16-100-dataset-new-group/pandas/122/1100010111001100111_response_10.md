The issue with the `equals()` function in the `managers.py` file in the `pandas` library seems to be related to the incorrect comparison of dataframes, leading to a false positive result.

### Bug Explanation:
The issue seems to occur due to the fact that the function incorrectly considers dataframes with identical blocks but different locations as equal. This is evident from the test case provided `test_dataframe_not_equal`, where two dataframes with the same columns, but with values interchanged, are incorrectly evaluated as equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function checks for the actual values within the data blocks and not just the block locations.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the above corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function is changed to consider the actual values within the blocks, along with their locations.
- The equality check is updated to use `array_equal` function from `numpy` to compare block values.

With these changes, the corrected function should now correctly check for the equality of dataframes and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
