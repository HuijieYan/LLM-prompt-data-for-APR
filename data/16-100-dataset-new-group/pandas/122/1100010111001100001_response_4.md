## Correction:

The issue with the `equals` function seems to be in the sorting of the blocks and then comparing the sorted blocks. 

The cause of the bug is that when sorting the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, the `canonicalize` function is using the `block.mgr_locs` attribute, which is not defined. This causes the sorting to fail, leading to incorrect comparison of blocks.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to sort the blocks based on their data types and their own index. The function can be updated as follows:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.values.dtype.name, block._blknos.tolist())
```

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block._blknos.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
