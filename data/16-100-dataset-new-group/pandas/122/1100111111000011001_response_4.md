The bug in the `equals` function is that it does not handle the `Block` objects correctly when checking for equality between two DataFrames. The function is comparing `Block` objects using the `equals` function, which may not be enough to ensure their equality.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly compare the `Block` objects within the DataFrames to ensure that they are equal. We can do this by iterating through each `Block` and comparing their attributes to ensure equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        self_block = self_blocks[i]
        other_block = other_blocks[i]
        if not type(self_block) == type(other_block):
            return False
        if self_block.shape != other_block.shape:
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected function, it will iterate through each `Block` in the DataFrames and compare their attributes to ensure equality. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.

This corrected function should satisfy all the expected cases provided.
