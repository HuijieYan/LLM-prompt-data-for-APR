The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison of 'self_axes' and 'other_axes', and the sorting and comparison of 'self_blocks' and 'other_blocks'. It appears that the sorting and comparison of blocks is not considering the correct values for the 'dtype' and 'mgr_locs' properties.

It seems that when comparing 'self_axes' and 'other_axes', the function is correctly checking for the length of the lists but is not comparing the actual contents of the axes.

In addition, when sorting the 'self_blocks' and 'other_blocks', the function is not considering the 'dtype' and 'mgr_locs' properties, which leads to incorrect sorting and comparison results.

To fix the bug, both the comparison of 'self_axes' and 'other_axes' and the sorting and comparison of 'self_blocks' and 'other_blocks' should consider all relevant properties.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.key))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.key))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
- The comparison of 'self_axes' and 'other_axes' now checks the actual content of the axes.
- The sorting and comparison of 'self_blocks' and 'other_blocks' now consider the 'dtype.name' and 'mgr_locs.key' properties of the blocks.
