The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The function is designed to compare the internal structures of the two `BlockManager` instances, including their axes and blocks.

The potential error in the function is when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. The code tries to sort the blocks using a custom key function `canonicalize`, which might not work as expected, leading to incorrect comparison between the block structures.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function might not be effectively distinguishing between different block types, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, a better strategy would be to directly compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances using a reliable comparison method for the block structures.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block directly
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through each block and directly compares the blocks using the `equals` method provided for the block structure. This ensures a reliable comparison and equality check between the two `BlockManager` instances.
