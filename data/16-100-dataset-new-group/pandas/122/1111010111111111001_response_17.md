Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values,))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values,))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
- The bug in the original function was due to the `canonicalize` function for sorting blocks. The `canonicalize` function used `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` as the sorting key, but this caused the test to fail as it was unable to properly distinguish between different types of blocks.
- I removed the `canonicalize` function and used a lambda function with `block.values` as the sorting key to properly sort the blocks based on their values.

By making these changes, the corrected function now sorts the blocks based on their values and performs the comparison as expected for the given test case. Therefore, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
