## Analysis:
- The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances, `self` and `other`, and returns `True` if the blocks are identical, but with different locations, which is incorrect. This caused the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.
- The GitHub issue reported that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

## Bug Location:
- The bug seems to be located in the logic of comparing the blocks in the `equals` function.
- The comparison of identical blocks with different locations is not handled correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
- The `canonicalize` function may also have issues in identifying block types correctly.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of identical blocks with different locations in the `equals` function.
- During comparisons, the function wrongly identified blocks with different locations as identical, leading to a `True` result when it should be `False`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the logic inside the `equals` function to correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure that block types are differentiated accurately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using a combination of type name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.make_block(values=block.values)._is_single_block, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison of blocks with different locations has been addressed, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations will not be considered equal. This will resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
