Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output values, the bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class is likely due to the comparison of blocks. The blocks are not being properly compared as the sorting mechanism in the equals function is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the sorting mechanism for canonicalizing blocks needs to be adjusted to ensure that the comparison between self.blocks and other.blocks is accurate. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on both their type name and the mgr_locs to ensure that unconsolidated blocks are correctly distinguished.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these corrections, the equals method should now correctly compare the blocks within the BlockManager, fixing the bug and allowing it to pass the failing test.
