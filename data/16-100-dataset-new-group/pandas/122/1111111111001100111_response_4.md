Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The `equals` method compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` checks the equality of two dataframes, which should return False since the columns contain different data types.

The bug occurs because the `equals` method incorrectly returns True when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This is due to the sort order being applied directly to the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists, which causes the comparison to fail even if the actual block contents are the same.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the `equals` method to compare the content of the blocks instead of comparing sorted lists directly. This can be achieved by iterating over blocks and comparing their contents individually.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we iterate over each block in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and compare their contents using the `equals` method of the `Block` class. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the actual content of the blocks rather than their sorted order.

This updated version should fix the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
