To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to consider the following:

1. The issue raised on GitHub indicates that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations. This means that the function is returning incorrect results for specific input scenarios.

2. The specific failing test exposes that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is returning `True` instead of `False` as expected.

3. The function `equals` compares different aspects of the input `self` and `other` objects, such as their axes and blocks, to determine if they are equal.

Based on this context, it seems that the issue arises when comparing the individual blocks within the `self` and `other` objects. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare these blocks, but there may be a problem with the sorting or comparison logic.

To resolve the bug, we can modify the block comparison logic within the `equals` function. It is essential to ensure that the comparison accurately identifies the equality of blocks and addresses any issues related to the sorting strategy.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_block_data = []
    other_block_data = []
    for block in self.blocks:
        self_block_data.append((block.values, block.mgr_locs))

    for block in other.blocks:
        other_block_data.append((block.values, block.mgr_locs))

    return all(
        (self_block_data[i] == other_block_data[i]) for i in range(len(self.blocks))
    )
```

In the corrected version, we directly compare the values and `mgr_locs` attribute of each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding blocks in `other.blocks`. This approach ensures that we accurately compare the individual blocks for equality.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and return the expected results in accordance with the GitHub issue description.
