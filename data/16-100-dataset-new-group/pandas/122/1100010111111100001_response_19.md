The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to incorrectly assert that `df1.equals(df2) is False`. The error message indicates that `True` is being returned when it should be `False`.

The bug is likely occurring in the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks before comparing them. This sorting may be resulting in a mismatch between the blocks of `df1` and `df2`, causing the `equals` function to return `True` instead of `False`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the blocks are being sorted correctly and compared accurately to determine if the data frames are equal.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in blocks]

    self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)
    return all(
        block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making the `canonicalize` function operate on the entire blocks and returning a list of tuples without sorting, it ensures that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared, allowing the `equals` function to produce the correct result for the failing test.
