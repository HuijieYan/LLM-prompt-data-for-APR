The buggy function `equals` is comparing two DataFrames `self` and `other` for equality. However, it has a bug in the canonicalization process where it compares the blocks within the DataFrames. The bug causes the function to fail the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` because it incorrectly identifies the DataFrames as equal when they are not.

The bug occurs in the `equals` function where it uses the `canonicalize` function to sort and compare the blocks within the DataFrames. The `canonicalize` function is not properly defined within the `BlockManager` class, leading to incorrect comparison and failing the test.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be properly defined within the `BlockManager` class. Additionally, the equality comparison of the DataFrames should be done directly without relying on sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function directly compares the blocks within the DataFrames for equality without relying on the `canonicalize` function, fixing the bug and ensuring that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes.
