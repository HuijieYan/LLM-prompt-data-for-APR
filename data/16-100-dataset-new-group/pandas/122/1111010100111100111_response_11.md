The buggy function has a logic error causing it to incorrectly return True instead of False when DF1 is compared to DF2. The issue is occurring because the function incorrectly compares self.blocks to other.blocks without accounting for potential differences in block locations.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the canonicalize function to include block.mgr_locs in its comparison criteria for canonicalizing blocks. This will ensure that blocks with identical content but different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal. This will resolve the issue posted on GitHub where the function wrongly returns True when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By including block.mgr_locs in the canonicalize function, the function will properly compare the block locations, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal. This correction resolves the issue and the function will now correctly return False when comparing DF1 and DF2.
