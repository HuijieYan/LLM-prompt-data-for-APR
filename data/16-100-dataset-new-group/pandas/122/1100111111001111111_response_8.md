To fix the bug in the buggy function, the issue related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, can be addressed. The bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks and their locations before comparing them.

The bug originates from the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This function attempts to sort the blocks based on their data type names and manager locations. However, the comparison does not account for different locations of identical blocks. Therefore, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the location information of the blocks as well.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to consider both the type and the location of the block when sorting. We can achieve this by using a tuple including the data type name, the manager locations, and the block values for each block. Additionally, the comparison should also consider the block values to ensure accurate comparison of identical blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple including the block values, the data type name, and the manager locations. This ensures that blocks with identical values but different locations are correctly compared.

With this fix, the `DataFrame.equals()` method should now correctly return `False` for cases where identical blocks have different locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
