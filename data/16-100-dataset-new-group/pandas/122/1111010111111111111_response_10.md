### Bug Explanation
The `equals` function checks if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the comparison is incorrect as it doesn't check block values correctly. This results in the function wrongly returning True for non-equal `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by modifying the `equals` function to compare the blocks more accurately. Specifically, the function should iterate through the blocks and check for equality of block values. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies when two `BlockManager` instances are not equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare block values
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly compare the two `BlockManager` instances and return the correct result, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
