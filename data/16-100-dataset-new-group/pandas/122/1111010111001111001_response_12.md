The bug in the function `equals` of the `BlockManager` class is likely caused by the way it sorts and compares `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The current comparison using `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` for sorting may not be providing the expected results.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to update the `canonicalize` function to derive a more representative canonical form of the block. This can be done by incorporating more relevant information from the block to create a unique identifier for sorting and comparison. 

The revised `canonicalize` function should reflect these changes and provide a more accurate representation of the blocks:

```python
# updated the canonicalize function to accurately represent the blocks
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.internal_values())

# updated the equals function to use the canonicalize function with mgr_locs and internal_values
def equals(self, other):
    # existing code
    # ...
  
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.internal_values())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After updating the `canonicalize` function and the block comparison logic in the `equals` function, the corrected version would ensure that the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is based on an appropriate representation of the blocks.

This fix should address the comparison issues and make the `equals` function work as expected.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance!
