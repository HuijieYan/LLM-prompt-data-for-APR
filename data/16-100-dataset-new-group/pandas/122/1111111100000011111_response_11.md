The bug in the `equals` function occurs when comparing DataFrames and improperly returning `True` in cases where identical blocks have different locations. The function is comparing different blocks based on their data type and location, but should instead compare based on the data itself.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function should be modified to compare blocks based on their data, rather than their type and location.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` function now compares the blocks directly, rather than sorting and comparing them based on their type and location. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly recognized as different, and the function will return the correct result.
