The bug in the code seems to be related to the comparison of DataFrames using the `equals` method. This is evident from the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` which compares two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method and expects the result to be `False`.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the actual result is `True`, which is not expected. This suggests that the `equals` method in the buggy function is not working as intended.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function for Case 1, it can be observed that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. The variables `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are being sorted and compared in the `equals` method, but there seems to be an issue with the sorting and comparison logic.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function and the sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. We need to make sure that the sorting and comparison logic results in the expected behavior for DataFrames.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().__str__(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function modifies the `canonicalize` function to use the string representation of block values instead of the data type name, and sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on this representation. This should resolve the issue with the comparison and sorting logic, ensuring that the `equals` method behaves as expected for DataFrames.
