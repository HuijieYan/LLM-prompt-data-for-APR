To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` to properly handle the comparison of DataFrames.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returns True for cases where identical blocks with different locations are being compared.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Modify to use dtypes instead of dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The key changes include modifying `canonicalize` function to use `dtypes` instead of `dtype.name` for block comparison. This ensures that the comparison is based on the data type and locations of the blocks, preventing the issue of identical blocks with different locations.

With this corrected version, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` should now pass and the issue described in the GitHub report should be resolved.
