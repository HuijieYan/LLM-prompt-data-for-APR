The bug appears to be caused by the compare method in the BlockManager class returning incorrect results. The failing test asserts that df1.equals(df2) is False, but the function is returning True instead.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks using the canonicalize function. It appears that the canonicalize function does not properly handle the dtype name or block locations, causing the sorting to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to handle block sorting correctly. We should ensure that it correctly handles the dtype name and manager locations for each block.

The corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should handle the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks correctly, ensuring that the equals function returns the expected results for the failing test.
