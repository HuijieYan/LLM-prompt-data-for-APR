### Analysis:
1. The error message says `assert True is False`, which means that the `df1.equals(df2)` call returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.
2. The GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" confirms that the `equals()` method is returning `True` when it should not.
3. The `equals` method in the `buggy function` is failing to properly compare identical blocks with different locations, leading to a false positive in the comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of identical blocks with different locations not returning `False` as expected. 

### Fix Strategy:
The `canonicalize` function and the subsequent sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` will not accurately compare identical blocks with different locations. Instead, we need to directly compare the blocks themselves.

### The corrected function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```
