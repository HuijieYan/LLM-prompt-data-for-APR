The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. However, there are errors in the implementation, as evidenced by the failing test and the incorrect return value. 

The failing test is showing that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, indicating that the function is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`. This suggests that the function is not correctly identifying the inequality between the two `BlockManager` objects.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are in the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`, as well as the comparison of individual blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect comparison of axes and blocks. The function should compare the axes and blocks of both `BlockManager` objects to determine their equality. It seems that the function is not performing this comparison correctly, resulting in the incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, the axes and blocks of both `self` and `other` should be properly compared, and the function should return `False` if any of these comparisons indicate inequality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
            
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
        
    return True
```

In this corrected version, we compare the axes of both `self` and `other` using a loop, and return `False` if any inequality is found. Similarly, we compare the blocks of both `self` and `other` using a loop, and return `False` if any inequality is found. If no inequality is found, the function returns `True` to indicate that both `BlockManager` objects are equal.
