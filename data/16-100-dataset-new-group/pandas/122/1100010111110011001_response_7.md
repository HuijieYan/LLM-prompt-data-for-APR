The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return `True` when it should return `False` for the given test case. This is due to the incorrect comparison of data frames `df1` and `df2`.

The bug is likely to be in the `equals` function where it compares `self.axes` and `other.axes`, and then proceeds to compare `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. Since the error message shows that `assert True is False`, it indicates that the buggy function is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion failure.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the data frames. Specifically, we need to correctly compare the axes and blocks of the data frames to determine if they are equal or not.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.apply(lambda x: x.values)
    other_blocks = other.blocks.apply(lambda x: x.values)
    
    return all((self_blocks == other_blocks).all())
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function correctly compares the axes of the data frames and then compares the values of the blocks to determine if the data frames are equal.

With this correction, the failing test case is expected to pass, and the `equals` function should now behave as intended.
