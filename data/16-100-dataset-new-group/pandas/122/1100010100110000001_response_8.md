The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning True when it should be returning False. This suggests that the implementation of the `equals` method is incorrect.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
- The comparison between the values of the dataframes `df1` and `df2`.
- The canonicalization of block order using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function may not be correctly sorting the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons between the dataframes.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to correctly sort the blocks and the comparison of the dataframes should be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.tobytes() == oblock.values.tobytes() and
        block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method should fix the bug and ensure that the comparison between the dataframes `df1` and `df2` passes the failing test.
