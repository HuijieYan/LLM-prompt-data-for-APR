The buggy function is the equals method within the BlockManager class. The function is responsible for comparing two BlockManager objects to determine if they are equal. The function first checks if the number of axes in each BlockManager is the same, then if each axis is equal, and finally if the blocks within each BlockManager are equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the comparison of the axes and the comparison of the blocks. These comparisons could be problematic if the axes are not properly matched, or if the blocks are not sorted correctly.

The cause of the bug may be that the function does not handle dataframes with different data types or different orders of data properly, leading to a false negative result.

A strategy for fixing the bug could be to ensure that the comparison of axes takes into account the data types and orders of the data within the axes. Additionally, the comparison of blocks should also consider the data types and orders of the data within the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_dtype_counts(), block.get_ftype_counts())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the equals function takes into account the data types and orders of the data within the axes and blocks, ensuring that the comparison is done accurately.
