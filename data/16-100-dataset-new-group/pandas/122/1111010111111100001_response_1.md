The bug in the equals function arises from the incorrect comparison of the two DataFrame objects, df1 and df2, using the equals method. In the buggy implementation of the equals function, when it compares the blocks of the two DataFrame objects, the order of the blocks is not considered properly, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, the sorting of the blocks based on their type names and manager locations should be implemented before comparing the blocks of the two DataFrame objects.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on dtype names and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )    
```

With the fixed implementation of the equals function, the failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" should now pass, as the correct comparison between the two DataFrame objects will be performed.
