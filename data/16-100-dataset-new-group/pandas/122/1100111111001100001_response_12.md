The bug in the provided function lies in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The issue is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice - once outside the BlockManager class and once inside. When sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the buggy function uses the `canonicalize` function defined outside the BlockManager class, which results in an incorrect sorting and therefore incorrect comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `canonicalize` function defined inside the BlockManager class and ensure that the correct `canonicalize` function is used for sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
