Based on the provided runtime and expected values, it appears that the buggy function is not properly comparing the blocks in the BlockManager. The equals method is likely failing to correctly compare the contents of the blocks, resulting in incorrect return values.

The buggy function does not properly handle the comparison of block contents. It attempts to sort the blocks using a custom sorting function, but the custom sorting function may not be implemented correctly. This can lead to a failure to compare the blocks accurately and result in incorrect return values.

To fix this, the custom sorting function should be implemented correctly to compare the blocks based on their content. Additionally, the equals method should use a reliable comparison algorithm to compare the sorted blocks.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort the blocks based on their content and compare
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tolist())
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```
In the corrected version, I've replaced the custom sorting function with a lambda function that sorts the blocks based on their values. Then, I've compared the sorted blocks directly using the == operator to provide an accurate comparison.
