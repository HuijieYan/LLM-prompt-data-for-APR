The cause of the bug in the function `equals` is that the comparison logic is not correctly handling the block order for different data types, resulting in the wrong comparison results between two BlockManager instances.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the block canonicalization step to properly account for different data types and their corresponding block order. Additionally, we need to ensure that the input parameters `self` and `other` are correctly compared and handled in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, accounting for different data types
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we updated the `canonicalize` function to use the type name of the block as part of the canonicalization process. This ensures that blocks are correctly ordered based on their data types. Additionally, we maintained the comparison logic to compare each block in the sorted order for both `self` and `other`, ensuring a correct comparison.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided and satisfy the expected input/output values.
