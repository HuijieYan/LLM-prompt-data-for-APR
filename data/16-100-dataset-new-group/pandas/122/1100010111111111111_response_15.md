The bug in the `equals` function causes it to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This leads to failing tests, such as `test_dataframe_not_equal`, which checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False` as expected.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, indicating that the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

Upon inspecting the provided runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, as well as the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution, it is clear that the bug is related to the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting based on `canonicalize` and comparison of blocks are leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will now correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames, ensuring that the comparison is accurate and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is resolved.

This correction should address the bug and resolve the issue posted in GitHub, ensuring that the `equals` function returns the expected values and addresses the problem description provided.
