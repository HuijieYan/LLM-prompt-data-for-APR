The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to not properly identify when two DataFrame objects are not equal. The error message indicates that the test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` but it is actually returning `True` instead.

Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables within the function, the comparison is failing because the function is not correctly identifying that the two DataFrames are not equal. The problem seems to stem from the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. It looks like the blocks are sorted based on the column names and indices, which is not the correct way to compare the equality of DataFrames.

To fix this bug, the sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` needs to be revised. Instead of relying on sorting by column names and indices, the function should compare the individual blocks directly to determine if the DataFrames are equal. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now accurately determine if two DataFrames are equal and pass the failing test.
