The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not handling the case of comparing dataframes with different data types in the columns. This leads to the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function compares the values within the blocks without considering the data types. As a result, the assertion fails and raises an `AssertionError`.

To fix the bug, we need to compare not only the values within the blocks but also the data types of the blocks. This will ensure that the comparison accounts for differences in data types, addressing the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype, tuple(block.mgr_locs.indexer))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        (block.values == oblock.values).all() and block.values.dtype == oblock.values.dtype
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass.
