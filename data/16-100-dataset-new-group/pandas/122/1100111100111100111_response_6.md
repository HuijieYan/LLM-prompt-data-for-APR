The bug in the equals function is causing it to incorrectly return True for two dataframes that are not equal. The issue was reported on GitHub with a detailed description and an expected output of False when comparing two different dataframes.

The bug occurs because the equals function is using a custom sorting scheme to compare blocks, which may cause it to return the wrong result. The canonicalize function is used to sort the blocks, but it is implemented twice in the in the BlockManager class and outside of it. This duplication may lead to inconsistency in the sorting logic, causing the equals function to return the wrong result. 

To fix this bug, the canonicalize function should be removed from the BlockManager class and used consistently with a single implementation. Sort the blocks using this canonicalize function and then compare them to fix the issue.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
