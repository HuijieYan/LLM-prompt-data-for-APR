The bug in the `equals` function is causing the wrong result to be returned, which is causing a failing test in the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function.

The cause of the bug is that when comparing the blocks in the `equals` function, the order of the blocks is not being handled consistently, leading to potentially equal blocks being compared as unequal due to different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks in a consistent manner that takes into account the block type and location. This will ensure that equal blocks are always compared as equal.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version introduces a `canonicalize` function that creates a tuple with the block type name and the block's manager locations. This tuple is then used to sort the blocks before comparison. This ensures that blocks are consistently ordered and equal blocks are always compared as equal.

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
