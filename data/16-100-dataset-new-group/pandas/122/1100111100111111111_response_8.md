## Correction:

The issue seems to be related to the comparison of DataFrame objects using the `equals` method. The failing test indicates that it is erroneously returning `True` when it should be `False`. This impels us to examine the `canonicalize` function and how it's being used to compare the blocks.

The cause of the bug appears to be in the `canonicalize` function and its sorting of blocks. Due to incorrect sorting, the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function is not being performed accurately, leading to erroneous results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function is accurate and reflects the expected order.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have ensured that the `canonicalize` function provides the expected order for block comparison. This should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result for comparing DataFrames.
