To fix the buggy function, we need to address the comparison of the 'blocks' attribute in the 'BlockManager' class. The 'equals' function compares the blocks based on their order, which may not be consistent with their content. We need to compare the blocks based on their content and order.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Perform element-wise comparison of the blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the 'blocks' attribute of the 'BlockManager' instance by iterating through each block and comparing them using the 'equals' method. This ensures a consistent and accurate comparison based on the block content and order.

This fixed version should satisfy the expected input/output values for all relevant test cases.
