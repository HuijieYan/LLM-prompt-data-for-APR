* It seems that the issue reported on GitHub is related to the function `equals` in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The problem described is that when testing the `equals` function with identical blocks in different locations, it incorrectly returns True instead of False.

* The function `equals` compares the axes and blocks of two internal managers, and it seems to be problematic when comparing the blocks due to potential differences in their locations.

* The cause of the bug could be due to the sorting and comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function, which might ignore the possibility of identical blocks in different locations.

* To fix the bug, a strategy could be to modify the block comparison logic to also consider the locations of the blocks. This may involve checking if the blocks are identical even if they are located in different positions within the internal manager.

* Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `tuple(block.mgr_locs)` to also include the locations of the blocks in the comparison. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as different.
