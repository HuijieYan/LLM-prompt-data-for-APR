The bug in the provided function `equals` is due to sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which is defined incorrectly and also seems to be a duplicate function. The correct `canonicalize` function is defined in the `BlockManager` class, so the function within the `BlockManager` class needs to be used rather than the outer function.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function used to sort `self_blocks` is called directly from the `BlockManager` instance `self` rather than defining it inside the `equals` function.
- The correct `canonicalize` function for `other_blocks` is called from the `other` instance of `BlockManager`.
- Other than these changes, the rest of the function remains unchanged.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly compare the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances.
