The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.

### Error Location
The bug likely originates from the logic used to check equality between two `BlockManager` objects, specifically in the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs when the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class fails to correctly identify that two `BlockManager` objects are not equal. This is evident in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, which asserts that two different DataFrames are not equal, but the `equals` method incorrectly returns `True`.

This likely happens because the logic for comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables using the `canonicalize` function does not handle cases where the blocks may have the same data but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method needs to be adjusted to account for cases where blocks may have identical data but different locations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses both the `values` and `mgr_locs` attributes of the block to create a unique representation for comparison. This should address the issue of incorrectly identifying identical blocks with different locations as equal.
