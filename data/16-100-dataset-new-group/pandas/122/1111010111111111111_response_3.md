The cause of the bug in the `equals` function lies in the sorting mechanism for the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting relies on the `canonicalize` function, which creates a unique key for each block based on the block's data type and locations. If unconsolidated blocks, such as Categorical blocks, have the same data type and locations, the `canonicalize` function cannot distinguish them, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to create a unique key for each block in all cases, including unconsolidated blocks. This will ensure that the sorting mechanism accurately reflects the differences between the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to create unique keys for blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version alters the `canonicalize` function to use the bytes representation of the block's locations if the block is unconsolidated, ensuring a unique key for each block. This will lead to accurate comparisons and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
