## Error location
The bug is likely to be located within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class.

### Cause of the bug
The `equals` method is currently not correctly comparing two `BlockManager` instances, leading to the wrong return result. When comparing two `BlockManager` instances, the method is not handling the comparisons of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` correctly, leading to the assert statement in the failing test to return `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug-fixing strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to correctly compare the `BlockManager` instances and ensure that the blocks are properly compared. This can be done by reviewing the logic of how `blocks` are compared for equality and modifying the logic as needed to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected version of the `equals` method
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(not ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` method should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances and return the expected result, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
