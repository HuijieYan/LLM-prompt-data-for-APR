The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to erroneously return `True` when comparing two DataFrames that should not be equal. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames. 

The bug is likely due to the sorting of the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to order the blocks, but it appears that it may not be consistently ordering them in a way that ensures accurate comparison.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization logic and sorting process for the blocks need to be revised to ensure that equivalent blocks are correctly identified as equal. Additionally, the comparison logic for the two DataFrames needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure that it correctly identifies any differences between the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks using mgr_locs and block values for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values))
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This revised function sorts the blocks based on both `mgr_locs` and `values`, ensuring that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` is based on a consistent and comprehensive ordering of block information. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and result in accurate comparison of DataFrames.
