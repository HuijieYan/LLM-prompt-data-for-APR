#### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class mistakenly returns `True` for cases where the blocks have the same data but different locations. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. However, the manager locations are not properly converted to a list before sorting. This leads to the comparison of blocks with identical data but different locations, resulting in a `True` output, which is incorrect.

#### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly convert the manager locations to a list before sorting the blocks. This will ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations will be sorted differently, resulting in a correct comparison.

#### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected `canonicalize` function, the blocks will now be sorted based on their type name and converted manager locations, ensuring that blocks with the same data but different locations will not be falsely identified as equal.
