The bug in the `equals` function seems to be causing the `DataFrame.equals()` method to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The issue provides a code sample where the `equals` method fails with two DataFrames `df3` and `df4`.

Upon analysis of the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables within the `equals` function, it appears that the issue might stem from the comparison of the blocks in different locations of the two BlockManagers. The sorting mechanism used to compare the blocks is not handling the situation where blocks with identical content are located differently in the BlockManagers. This leads to incorrect comparison results and potential erroneous `True` returns from the `equals` method.

To fix this issue, the sorting and comparison of blocks should consider their content as well as their locations. It might involve assigning identifiers to the blocks based on their content and locations and comparing these identifiers to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name, content, and then mgr_locs
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function takes into account the content of the blocks as well as their locations, creating a unique identifier for each block. These identifiers are then used for sorting and comparison of the blocks, ensuring that even if the blocks are located differently, they are correctly identified as equal or not.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `equals` method correctly handles the comparison of BlockManagers with identical blocks in different locations.
