The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class causes the `df1.equals(df2)` test to fail, returning `True` instead of the expected `False`. The bug is likely to be in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function, as indicated by the AssertionError. The issue in GitHub confirms that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison logic and ensure that it properly handles comparing identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Ensure that the blocks are equal, regardless of their order
    def block_equals(block1, block2):
        consolidated_block1 = block1.consolidate()
        consolidated_block2 = block2.consolidate()
        return consolidated_block1.equals(consolidated_block2)

    return all(
        block_equals(block, other.blocks[i]) 
        for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we've added a `block_equals` function that consolidates both blocks before comparing them. We then use this function to check the equality of each pair of blocks in the `self` and `other` objects, regardless of their order.

This should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct comparison result, as expected in the failing test.
