The bug in the provided function `equals` causes the `DataFrame.equals` method to return `True` in cases where the contents of the DataFrames are actually different. This behavior goes against what is expected and is clearly demonstrated by the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The error message from the failing test indicates that the method is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The cause of this bug likely stems from the incorrect comparison of DataFrame blocks between the two DataFrames. Specifically, the issue arises from a call to the `_consolidate_inplace` method before comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. This can lead to the incorrect comparison of blocks due to inconsistent ordering.

To fix this bug, one potential strategy is to carefully consider the block comparison logic, avoiding any unnecessary consolidation of blocks. By ensuring that the blocks are directly compared without any alteration, the correct results can be achieved.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, and the issue reported in GitHub should be resolved.
