The bug in the equals function is causing it to return True instead of False when comparing unequal DataFrames, leading to a failing test. The bug is likely to be in the canonicalize function used to sort the blocks before comparison.

The cause of the bug is that the canonicalize function defined within the equals function is not being used correctly. This function defines a sorting key for the blocks based on their data and locations. However, it is defined twice, once within the class and once within the equals function, leading to ambiguity about which one should be used. As a result, the sorting key is not being generated correctly, causing the equals function to return True for unequal DataFrames.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to remove the second definition of the canonicalize function within the equals function. This will ensure that the original canonicalize function defined in the class will be used, and the correct sorting key will be generated for the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the equals function should now return False for unequal DataFrames, passing the failing test.
