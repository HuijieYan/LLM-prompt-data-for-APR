The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of blocks with different locations. The issue posted on GitHub indicates that when running `df3.equals(df4)`, the function wrongly returns `True` instead of `False`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparison of the `self` and `other` block locations and the sorting of blocks using `canonicalize`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect results when checking for equality.

To fix the bug, we can revise the logic in the `equals` function to properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we update the `canonicalize` function to use the `values` of the block instead of the `dtype.name`. This should help in properly identifying and comparing blocks with different locations.

By incorporating this change, the `equals` function should now correctly handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations and return the expected result.
