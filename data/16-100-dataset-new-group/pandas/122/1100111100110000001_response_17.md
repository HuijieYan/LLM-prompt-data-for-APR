The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two data frames `df1` and `df2` and determine if they are equal. It seems that the function is not properly comparing the two data frames, as it is returning the wrong result. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, where it is expected to be `False` but is actually `True`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, and the comparison using the `equals` function at the end.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function defined within the `equals` function is not handling the data frames `df1` and `df2` correctly, which leads to them being sorted and compared in a wrong way.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be corrected to properly handle the data frames, and the comparison using the `equals` function should be reviewed to ensure it is comparing the data frames correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [block.make_block_same_class(block._simple_block(canonicalize(block), block.values), fastpath=True) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block.make_block_same_class(block._simple_block(canonicalize(block), block.values), fastpath=True) for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is used to create new blocks for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` and ensure that the comparison using the `equals` function is done correctly. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
