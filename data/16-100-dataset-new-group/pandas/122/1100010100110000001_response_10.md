The error message indicates that the equals method is returning True instead of False even though the dataframes df1 and df2 are not equal.

The cause of the bug is that the canonicalization of the blocks is not being done correctly. This results in the equals method returning True when it should be False.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalization of the blocks is done in a way that accurately represents the equality of the dataframes.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the values
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_string())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_string())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are being canonicalized by sorting them based on their values. This ensures that the blocks are ordered and compared accurately.
