### Analysis
The function compares two BlockManager objects to check if they are equal. It checks the length of the axes, then checks if each axis is equal, consolidates the blocks, and then sorts and compares the blocks.

### Bug
The bug seems to be related to the `canonicalize` function. In the `canonicalize` function, there is an attempt to access `.as_array` on `mgr_locs`, which causes an AttributeError. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the `equals` function and once within the `BlockManager` class, but with different signatures.

### Fix
We need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function is defined properly and that any attributes being accessed exist and are accessed correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# Other functions remain unchanged

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions remain unchanged
    
    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.info())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is defined within the `equals` function using the correct attributes of the `block` object. This should resolve the AttributeError and ensure that the function works as expected.
