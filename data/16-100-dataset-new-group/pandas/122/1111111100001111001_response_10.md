The bug in the equals function is likely caused by the incorrect implementation of the canonicalize function and the sorting of blocks using this function. The canonicalize function is called twice - once at the beginning of the function and once within the sorting of self.blocks and other.blocks. However, the canonicalize function is only supposed to be defined within the BlockManager class, not outside it. Additionally, the canonicalize function takes in a block parameter, but it should take in self and block parameters instead.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be moved inside the BlockManager class and modified to take in self and block parameters. Then, the sorting of self.blocks and other.blocks should use the canonicalize function correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    """
    Core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
    ...
    """

    # Other functions within the BlockManager class
    ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Move the canonicalize function inside the BlockManager class
        def canonicalize(self, block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
After making these changes, the equals function in the BlockManager class should work correctly and return the expected values and types for the given input parameters.
