The buggy function is `equals`, which is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks.

The potential causes of the bug are as follows:
1. The function is attempting to call `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()`, but these methods are never defined within the `BlockManager` class.
2. There is a nested function `canonicalize` defined within the `equals` function, which may cause confusion and issues with scope.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary redefinition of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method, as there is already a `canonicalize` function defined within the `BlockManager` class.
2. If the intention is to call the `_consolidate_inplace` method of the `BlockManager` class, ensure that this method is correctly implemented within the class definition.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # The canonicalize function should be used from the class level
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected function, it will attempt to call the `canonicalize` method of the `BlockManager` class, for both `self` and `other`. The unnecessary redefinition of `canonicalize` within the `equals` function has been removed. If the `canonicalize` method of the `BlockManager` class is implemented and functional, this should fix the bug in the `equals` function.
