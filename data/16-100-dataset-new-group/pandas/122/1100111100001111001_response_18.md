The bug seems to be caused by the `canonicalize` function being defined twice, once outside the `BlockManager` class and once within it, leading to confusion about which function is being called. The correct function should be the one defined within the `BlockManager` class.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the `canonicalize` function defined outside the `BlockManager` class and ensure that the `canonicalize` function being used is the correct one within the `BlockManager` class.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `canonicalize` function being used is the one defined within the `BlockManager` class, which should resolve the bug.
