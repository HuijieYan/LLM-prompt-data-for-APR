Based on the provided information, the bug in the equals() function seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of blocks during DataFrame comparison. The expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return have been listed and the failing test function has been provided. The GitHub issue details the problem that the equals() method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The bug appears to be in the canonicalize function, which is used for sorting the blocks before comparison. The canonicalize function should account for the dataframe type and the location of blocks.

To fix the bug, we can modify the canonicalize function to concatenate the type name with the mgr_locs to ensure that unconsolidated blocks with the same data type are correctly distinguished. Then, the sorted function should be used to sort the blocks before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the equals() function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # updated canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs 
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these modifications, the corrected equals() function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
