The bug in the given function arises from the comparison logic in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The comparison is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal, but it fails to account for the possibility that the blocks may be in different orders.

After analyzing the input parameters and the variables at the return point, it is evident that the bug occurs due to the lack of handling cases where the block order may differ between the two `BlockManager` instances being compared.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to sort the blocks in both `self` and `other` before performing the comparison. By sorting the blocks based on their type name and location, we can ensure that the comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances is not affected by the block order.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the comparison is now based on the sorted order of the blocks, ensuring that the `equals` method handles cases where the block order may differ between the two `BlockManager` instances. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
