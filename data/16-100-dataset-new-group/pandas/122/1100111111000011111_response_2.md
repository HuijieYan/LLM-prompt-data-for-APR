## Correction:

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is defined both in the global scope and within the `BlockManager` class. When it is called within the `equals` function, it references the global scope `canonicalize` function instead of the one within the `BlockManager` class.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the global scope `canonicalize` function and ensure that the `canonicalize` function called within the `equals` function references the one within the `BlockManager` class. Additionally, we should remove the unnecessary usage of `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions remain unchanged

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the GitHub issue.
