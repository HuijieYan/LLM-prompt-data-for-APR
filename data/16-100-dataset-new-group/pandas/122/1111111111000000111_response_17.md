The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class incorrectly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. The issue was reported on GitHub with a failing test case for the `DataFrame.equals()` method.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect logic for comparing the axes of two data frames and the lengths of their blocks
2. Incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is incorrectly comparing the identical blocks with different locations, leading to a wrong return value.

To fix the bug, the logic for comparing the axes and lengths of blocks should be corrected, and the sorting and comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function should be revised.

Based on the problem described and the identified potential errors, the corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # comparing blocks using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    # to handle the case of identical blocks with different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function now properly handles the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, addressing the issue reported on GitHub. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the bug.
