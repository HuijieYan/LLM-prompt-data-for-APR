To fix the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, we can update the sorting of the blocks to ensure that it is consistent and takes into account the differences in block locations. The current implementation does not handle the case where identical blocks with different locations exist, which leads to incorrect results for the `equals` comparison.

Additionally, the comparison of block equality should consider not only the block data type but also the block locations to accurately reflect the equivalence of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block type and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # compare the sorted blocks for equality, accounting for block locations
    return all(
        type(block) == type(oblock) and block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on both the data type and the block locations, enabling a comprehensive comparison to determine equality.

With these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly handle the case of identical blocks with different locations and return the expected results for DataFrame comparisons, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
