The issue with the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is that it wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This has been reported as a bug on GitHub with the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates the issue with the `equals` method when comparing two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, which have the same data but in different locations. The test expects the result of `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`, but it fails with the error message `assert True is False`, indicating that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The cause of this bug is within the `equals` method implementation in the `BlockManager` class. When comparing the blocks of two instances (`self` and `other`), the method does not account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations, causing it to return `True` incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be modified to properly handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations and return the correct result based on the data rather than the block locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `_get_values()` to access the actual data within the block and `block.mgr_locs.as_array` to identify the location of the block. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are properly compared, and the `equals` method will return the correct result in all scenarios, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
