### Analysis:
The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing two dataframes. The issue has been identified on GitHub with the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The failing test also shows that when two dataframes with identical blocks but different locations are compared using `equals`, it returns `True` instead of `False`, which is incorrect.

### Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic within the `equals` function seems to be incorrectly considering the block locations while comparing the dataframes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because the `equals` function is not correctly handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations between two dataframes. As a result, it returns `True` instead of `False` when it should actually return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic to compare the dataframes without considering the block locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare blocks without considering block locations
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
In the corrected version, the comparison now sorts the blocks based on their values and compares them without considering block locations. This will ensure that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks, rather than their locations.
