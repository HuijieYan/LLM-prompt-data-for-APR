The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return incorrect results when comparing two BlockManager objects. The bug is causing identical blocks with different locations to be incorrectly evaluated as equal. This has been reported as a bug on GitHub, with the expected output being False, but the function is currently returning True.

The cause of the bug is the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which compares blocks based on their type name and then their mgr_locs. This results in incorrectly sorting the blocks, leading to the comparison returning True when it should be False.

To fix this bug, the sorting mechanism needs to be updated to correctly compare blocks based on their actual content rather than their type and location.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are directly compared for equality without sorting based on type and location, ensuring that the comparison returns the expected result as reported in the GitHub issue.
