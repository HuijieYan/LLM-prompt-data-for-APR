The bug in the function arises because when comparing two BlockManager objects, the function `equals` relies on the order of the internal blocks. However, the order of the blocks is not guaranteed to be consistent between the two BlockManager objects, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their order. One way to achieve this is by comparing the sorted versions of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on their content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: list(block.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: list(block.values))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will compare the blocks based on their content rather than their order, and the failing test case is expected to pass.
