The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file of pandas package is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the dataframes `df1` and `df2` in the test. It is returning `True` instead of `False` as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly compare the dataframes. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.__class__), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version of the `equals` function, we modify the `canonicalize` function to use the string representation of the block's class and the `mgr_locs`. This ensures that the blocks are correctly compared, fixing the bug.

With this corrected function, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
