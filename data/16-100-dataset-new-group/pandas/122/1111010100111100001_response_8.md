The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The failing test produces an error where `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails. The error message indicates that `True` is being compared to `False`, and it includes the string representation of the `df1` and `df2` dataframes.

The buggy function appears to compare axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances using the `equals` method. However, it may be encountering issues in comparing the elements due to the ordering and types of the blocks.

The current block canonicalization method is designed to sort the blocks of both `BlockManager` instances based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. It is possible that the canonicalization is not achieving the desired result, leading to incorrect comparisons of the blocks.

To fix the bug, a potential strategy is to review the canonicalization process and ensure that it is correctly identifying and ordering the blocks for comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now converts the `dtype` to a string and converts `mgr_locs` to a tuple for consistent comparison. This should ensure that the blocks are correctly ordered and compared, addressing the bug in the original function.
