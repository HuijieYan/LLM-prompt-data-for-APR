The code is trying to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The test is expecting the comparison to return `False` because the DataFrames have different values, but it fails with an assertion error.

The potential error in the `equals` function is that it is comparing the DataFrames based on their blocks and not the actual values of the DataFrames.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is comparing the blocks themselves, not the values within the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the values within the blocks, rather than the blocks themselves.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the shapes of the DataFrames first
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False

    # Then compare the actual values within the DataFrames
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

This correction simplifies the comparison logic to check the shapes of the DataFrames and then compare their values directly. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
