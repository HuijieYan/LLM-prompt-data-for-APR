## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to occur due to an incorrect comparison of the data blocks and axes of two DataFrames in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue accurately identifies that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations. To fix this bug, we need to correct the comparison logic in the `equals` method.

### Analysis
1. The inputs to the `equals` method are two `BlockManager` objects, `self` and `other`.
2. The `equals` method compares the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Comparison of axes: The code compares the axes of `self` and `other` to check for equality, which might be incorrect.
2. Block comparison: The code compares the data blocks of `self` and `other` to check for equality, which could also be incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by an incorrect comparison of the axes and data blocks of the `BlockManager` objects in the `equals` method, leading to an incorrect evaluation of equality.

### Bug Fix
1. A strategy to fix the bug would be to compare the data in the blocks directly, ensuring that the data is identical irrespective of the location.
2. We may also need to reconsider the approach to axis comparison to ensure that axes of different `BlockManager` objects are correctly assessed for equality.

### Corrected Version
Based on the bug analysis, here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Comparison of blocks
    for block_name in self._data.items:
        self_block = self._data.get(block_name)
        other_block = other._data.get(block_name)
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```
In the corrected version, we first compare the axes and then iterate through the data blocks, comparing them for equality using the `equals` method. This should address the bug and ensure correct evaluation of equality between `BlockManager` objects.
