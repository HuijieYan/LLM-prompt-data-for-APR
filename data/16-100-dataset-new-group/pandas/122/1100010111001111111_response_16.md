The buggy function `equals` currently has issues with sorting and comparing blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` for the failing test case provided.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function.
2. Comparison of blocks using the `equals` method.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect behavior of the sorting and comparison process in the `canonicalize` function. This leads to the function returning `True` instead of `False` for the failing test case provided in the GitHub issue.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to create a consistent and unique representation for the blocks based on their data type and content.
2. Improve the comparison process to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to create a consistent and unique representation for the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.values.tostring())

    # Sorting the blocks based on the modified canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Comparison of blocks to ensure they are not equal
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
``` 

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test provided, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
