The bug in the provided function is causing the failing test because it is incorrectly comparing two instances of `BlockManager` using the `equals` function. The `equals` function first checks if the number of axes in both BlockManagers is the same. If so, it then checks if each axis is equal between the two BlockManagers using the `equals` function of the individual axes.

The bug arises when the `equals` function is applied to the `axes` attribute, and it incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two different axes from the BlockManagers, leading to the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix this bug, you should compare the `blocks` attribute of both BlockManagers instead of the `axes`. This will correctly compare the underlying data structure and resolve the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.items))
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.items))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, as the correct underlying data comparison is now being performed.
