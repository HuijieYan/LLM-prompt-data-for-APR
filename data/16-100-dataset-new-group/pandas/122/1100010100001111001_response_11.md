The bug in the provided function is likely due to the sorting of the blocks and a comparison issue within the `equals` method.

The bug occurs when the function incorrectly compares and sorts the blocks, leading to an incorrect `equals` return value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the blocks are sorted and compared within the `equals` method. We should ensure that the sorting is done correctly and that the comparison of the blocks is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the `canonicalize` function to avoid accessing attributes of the block and instead used the block type and its locations. Then, we sort the blocks based on this canonicalization. Finally, we directly compare the blocks in a loop to ensure their equality.

This should address the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output for the given input.
