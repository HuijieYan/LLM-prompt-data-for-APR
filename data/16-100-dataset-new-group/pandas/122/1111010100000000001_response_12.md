Buggy function analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class. It compares two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. It does this by comparing the shape, axes, and the actual blocks of data within the `BlockManager`.

Potential error locations:
1. The `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` may not be functioning as intended.
2. The sorting of the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function may not be accurate.
3. The comparison of the individual blocks using `block.equals` and `oblock.equals` could be incorrect.

Cause of the bug:
The `equals` function may not be properly consolidating the data before comparison. It may also not be sorting the blocks correctly, leading to inaccurate comparisons.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the data is properly consolidated before comparison.
2. Use a stable and accurate sorting method for the blocks.
3. Verify the accuracy of the block comparisons.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the data is first consolidated using `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()`. Then, the blocks are sorted using a more robust method using the `canonicalize` function, which sorts based on dtype and `mgr_locs`. Finally, the comparison of individual blocks is performed using `block.equals` and `oblock.equals` within the `all()` function to ensure all blocks are equal.
