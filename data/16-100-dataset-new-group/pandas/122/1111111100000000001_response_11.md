The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class which is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The function is meant to check if the axes are equal and if the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances are equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Comparing the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without considering the content of the axes.
2. Using the `equals` method for axes comparison without checking for potential None values.
3. Sorting the blocks based on a function `canonicalize` which is not defined properly.

The cause of the bug in the function is that it has not been implemented correctly for comparing the `BlockManager` instances. The function should correctly compare the axes and blocks to determine equality between the two `BlockManager` instances.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Refactor the logic to compare axes to properly handle potential None values and content comparison.
2. Review the `canonicalize` function and ensure it is defined correctly for sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if self_axes is None or other_axes is None:
        return self_axes == other_axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have compared axes properly, accounted for potential None values, and sorted the blocks using the `canonicalize` function defined correctly for this purpose.
