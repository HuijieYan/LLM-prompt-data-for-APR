The issue identified here is that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should return `False` for two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks that are not consolidated in the same order.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `equals` method checks if the axes of the two DataFrames are equal, but it does not distinguish the locations of the blocks.
2. Sorting and comparison of blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs need to be adjusted.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method without ensuring that their positions are aligned. As a result, the method incorrectly returns `True` for dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the blocks in both DataFrames are consolidated in the same order before comparing them.
2. Use the sorted order of blocks for comparison to account for the difference in locations.
3. Modify the comparison logic to consider both dtype and mgr_locs when canonicalizing the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort and compare blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the code ensures that the blocks in both DataFrames are consolidated in the same order before comparison, addressing the issue identified in the failing test and the GitHub report.
