The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager. This is leading to the erroneous comparison result in the failing test case. The function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager instances, `self` and `other`, and it performs comparisons on the `axes` and `blocks` attributes of the BlockManager instances.

The bug occurs due to incorrect comparison of the `blocks` attribute. The function uses `sorted` method to order the blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs`, and then compares them. However, this comparison is not working as expected and is leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the blocks directly without attempting to order them based on `dtype` and `mgr_locs`. Instead, it should iterate over the blocks and compare them individually. This will ensure that each block is compared accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function will accurately compare the blocks within the BlockManager instances, ensuring that the comparison results are correct and the failing test case will pass.
