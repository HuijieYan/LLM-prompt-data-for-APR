The bug in the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return `True` instead of `False` in some cases where it should return `False`. This bug is resulting in failing test cases and has been reported in a GitHub issue with the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The cause of the bug is related to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The function is not correctly checking for identical blocks with different locations, which leads to incorrect equality comparisons. This is evident from the failing test case provided.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `equals` function to compare blocks properly and ensure that it returns the correct result for DataFrame equality checks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version of the function, the comparison of blocks is being done more accurately, ensuring that it returns the expected result for DataFrame equality checks. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
