The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` for the case when there are identical blocks with different locations. This behavior is not expected and does not match the user's requirements.

The potential error location is within the `equals` function, where it compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects.

The cause of the bug is the sorting of blocks based on their type name and locations. Due to the use of `sorted`, the blocks are not compared correctly, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to modify the comparison logic between the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly without sorting
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are compared directly without being sorted based on their type name and locations. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified, leading to the expected behavior where the function returns `False` for the case when there are identical blocks with different locations.
