    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

## Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function occurs when comparing the data blocks of two dataframes. The original function compares the blocks using the `equals` method, which checks for specific block attributes and does not compare their values. This leads to incorrect results, as the block values should be compared for equality.

Additionally, the `canonicalize` function should use the `dtypes` attribute instead of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` attribute directly, which can lead to inconsistencies.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be updated to compare the values of the data blocks using the `values` attribute and the `canonicalize` function should use the `dtypes` attribute instead. The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and should pass the failing test.
