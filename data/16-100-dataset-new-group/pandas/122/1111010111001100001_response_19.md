The potential error in the buggy function lies in the `canonicalize` function, where it is trying to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. It seems that the `mgr_locs` are not being handled correctly, which may lead to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `mgr_locs` are not being correctly converted to a list in the `canonicalize` function, which leads to incorrect comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` are correctly converted to a list in the `canonicalize` function and then use it for sorting and comparison of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), list(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `mgr_locs` are converted to a list using the `list` constructor, and the `dtype` is converted to a string using the `str` constructor before forming a tuple for comparison. This should address the bug and make the function work correctly with the provided test case.
