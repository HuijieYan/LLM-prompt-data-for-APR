## Correction:

The issue with the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is that it doesn't correctly compare the blocks within the object. The comparison does not take into account the index positions and datatypes, resulting in incorrect results. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `equals` method to compare the blocks in a more comprehensive manner, taking into account the block datatypes and their positions within the object.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    # Consolidate both objects to ensure proper comparison of blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a list of booleans indicating whether the blocks are equal
    blocks_equal = [block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)]
    # Check if all the blocks are equal
    return all(blocks_equal)
```

With this correction, the comparison will take into account the block datatypes and their positions, ensuring a proper comparison of the BlockManager objects. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct results.
