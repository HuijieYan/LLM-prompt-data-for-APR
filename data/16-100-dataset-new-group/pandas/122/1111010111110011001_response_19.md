The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library. It is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` is designed to check if the `equals` function correctly identifies two different DataFrames as unequal.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, and it evaluates to `assert True is False`. This indicates that the `equals` function returned `True` when it was expected to return `False`. 

The expected input and output values are provided in the comment. The key issue with the current implementation of the `equals` function is likely the comparison of the blocks in the two instances. The block comparison may not be accurate, leading to the function incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

To fix the bug, the block comparison logic needs to be revisited. Instead of directly comparing blocks using the `equals` method, a more comprehensive comparison of block contents should be implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of the block contents has been improved to ensure accurate comparison. This should address the bug and make the function return the expected result.
