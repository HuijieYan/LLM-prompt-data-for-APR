### Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, the GitHub issue:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. Its purpose is to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The GitHub issue indicates that the function is returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect behavior.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of block ordering within the `equals` function, as per the issue's description.

### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function might be causing the bug.
2. The comparison of blocks in the return statement could be problematic.

### Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the GitHub Issue information:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle identical blocks with different locations. The use of the `canonicalize` function for sorting blocks may not take into account the possibility of identical blocks at different locations. This leads to incorrect equality comparison in some cases.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations in addition to block types. We also need to ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account their locations.

### Provide a corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    # Modified canonicalize function to consider block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._typ, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    # Compare blocks considering their locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function ensures that it takes into account the block locations when comparing blocks for equality, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
