## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The bug in the original function is related to the sorting in the canonicalize function. In the corrected version, the canonicalize function returns a tuple combining the block's class and mgr_locs. Then, the self_blocks and other_blocks are sorted using the canonicalize function. This will ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted and the equals function will work as expected.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This will also address the issue reported on GitHub related to DataFrame.equals() wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
