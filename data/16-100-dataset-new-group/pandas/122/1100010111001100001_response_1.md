The bug in the provided function `equals` seems to be related to comparing the `self_block` and `other_block` using the `equals` method. The issue may arise due to the ordering of the blocks and the way they are being compared.

The strategy to fix the bug could involve sorting the blocks in a consistent order before comparing them. This could ensure that the comparison is based on the actual block values rather than their order.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort both self_blocks and other_blocks before comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing them using the `sorted` function and a lambda function as the key for sorting. This ensures that the blocks are being compared in a consistent and predictable order, which should address the bug.
