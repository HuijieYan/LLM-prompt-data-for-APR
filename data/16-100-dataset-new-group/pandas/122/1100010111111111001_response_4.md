The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to result in an AssertionError. The error message indicates that the expected result is `True`, but the function is returning `False`. This suggests that the function is incorrectly evaluating the equality of the two DataFrames.

The bug likely lies within the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the block data before performing the equality check. Due to this sorting, the equality of the blocks does not align with the expected DataFrame comparison.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to properly sort the blocks based on the data they contain. Additionally, the ordering of the blocks should be maintained to ensure accurate comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().tobytes(), block.index)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the DataFrames and pass the failing test.
