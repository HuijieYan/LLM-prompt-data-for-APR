The buggy function `equals` is comparing the equality of two `BlockManager` objects. The failing test asserts that two different `DataFrame` objects are not equal using the `equals` method of the `df1` object and providing the `df2` object as the input.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. In the comparison of the lengths of `self.axes` and `other.axes`.
2. In the comparison of individual elements in `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
3. In the comparison of the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
4. In the sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

The cause of the bug is that the function `equals` does not handle the comparison of `BlockManager` objects properly, leading to incorrect results in the presence of different inputs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` is performed correctly. Additionally, we should verify the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to ensure that the comparison logic is sound and returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False

    # Sort and compare the blocks
    self_blocks = sorted([(block.shape, block.values) for block in self.blocks])
    other_blocks = sorted([(block.shape, block.values) for block in other.blocks])
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, we compare the individual elements in `self_axes` and `other_axes` using a loop to ensure that the comparison is done correctly. Subsequently, we sort and compare the blocks based on their shapes and values to determine their equality.
