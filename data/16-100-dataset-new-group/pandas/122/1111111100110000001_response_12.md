The bug in the `equals` function seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison of dataframes `df1` and `df2`. The function tries to compare two dataframes using the `equals` method, but it fails and returns `True` when it should return `False`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect comparison logic for dataframes `df1` and `df2`.
2. Potential inconsistency during data block comparison.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not implementing the comparison logic correctly. When comparing the blocks within the dataframes, the function is not correctly identifying whether the data blocks are equal or not.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to use the correct comparison logic to compare the data blocks within the dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version correctly compares the blocks within the dataframes, returning `True` only if all the blocks are equal, and `False` otherwise. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
