## Bug Cause and Explanation
The buggy function is a part of the `BlockManager` class, used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The bug occurs because the function `canonicalize` defined within the `equals` method does not properly compare the blocks' dtype and mgr_locs attributes. This results in the function incorrectly returning True when the blocks have identical contents but are located in different positions.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function properly considers the dtype and mgr_locs attributes of the blocks. Additionally, we should also make sure that the logic for block comparison is correct and takes into account the correct sorting and comparison of block attributes.

## Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now properly considers the dtype and mgr_locs attributes of the blocks when creating the tuple for comparison. Additionally, the sorted blocks are being compared based on the updated `canonicalize` function to accurately determine if the instances of `BlockManager` are equal.
