### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the function is currently not properly comparing the blocks, resulting in incorrect equality checks.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of block lengths (`len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks)`) does not take into account the actual block data.
2. The `canonicalize` function does not properly handle the comparison of block types and locations.
3. The function does not handle the case where the number of axes in `self` is not equal to the number of axes in `other`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to incorrect comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. This causes the function to return True even when the blocks have different values but are located differently within the objects.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Compare the block content rather than just the block length.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to handle block type and location properly.
3. Account for the number of axes when comparing `self` and `other`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to include the dtype and mgr_locs of the block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function now properly compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects, accounting for their content and location. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the equality checks behave as expected.
