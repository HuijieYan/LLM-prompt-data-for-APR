Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The expected behavior is for the `equals` function to return False, but it wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

The bug stems from the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering the order of columns within the blocks and their indexes. As a result, the comparison returns True even when the order of the blocks and their contents differ.

To fix this, you can modify the `equals` function to account for the internal block order and the location of blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. By sorting the blocks in both instances using a canonicalization process, you can ensure a consistent comparison and return the correct equality result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order and locations
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return sorted((block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in blocks)
    
    self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks and their respective indexes for both `self` and `other` instances before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is based on a consistent internal representation, resulting in the correct equality check.

With this modification, the `equals` function will correctly return False for the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` and resolve the GitHub issue raised regarding the incorrect return value for the equality check.
