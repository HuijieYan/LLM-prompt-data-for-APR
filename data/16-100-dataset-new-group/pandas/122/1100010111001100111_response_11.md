The bug in the `equals` function is likely related to the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. Based on the failing test and the runtime variable values, it seems that the comparison is not properly considering the identical blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect return value of `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to properly handle cases where blocks have identical data but are located differently.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(sorted(block.mgr_locs)))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Here, the `canonicalize` function creates a unique representation for each block, taking into account both the type name and the sorted `mgr_locs`. The comparison of blocks uses this canonical representation to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are treated as distinct.

With this fix, the `equals` function should now properly handle cases where blocks have identical data but are located differently, and the failing test should be passed successfully.
