The bug in the provided function `equals` from the `BlockManager` class is that it is not comparing the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block when trying to check if the blocks are equal. The `canonicalize` function currently only returns the dtype of the block and does not take into account the location of the block within the manager.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block. Additionally, we need to ensure that we are comparing the location of each block in the manager to determine if they are equal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and (block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the `mgr_locs` attribute of each block. Additionally, when comparing the blocks, we also check if their `mgr_locs` are equal.

This fix will ensure that the comparison takes into account the location of each block within the manager, resolving the bug in the function.
