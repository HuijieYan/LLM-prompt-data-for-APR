### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` for canonicalization.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the DataFrame blocks due to the incorrect canonicalization of blocks. This leads to the wrong result being returned when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The strategy for fixing the bug involves correctly sorting and comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames. Additionally, the canonicalization of blocks needs to be done in a way that ensures correct comparison.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = {block.label: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {block.label: block for block in other.blocks}
    
    if self_blocks.keys() != other_blocks.keys():
        return False
    
    for label, block in self_blocks.items():
        if label not in other_blocks:
            return False
        if not block.equals(other_blocks[label]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version correctly compares the blocks of the two DataFrames and ensures that the equality check is performed correctly based on the blocks' labels and content. This updated approach should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
