The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. Based on the failing test and runtime input/output values, it appears that the issue lies within the sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` function to sort the blocks based on their content, rather than their locations, before comparing them. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly recognized as equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this change, the `equals` function should correctly identify DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations as not equal, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
