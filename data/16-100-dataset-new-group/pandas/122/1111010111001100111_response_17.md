Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    self_sorted_blocks = self_blocks.sort_values(by=self_blocks.columns.tolist())
    other_sorted_blocks = other_blocks.sort_values(by=other_blocks.columns.tolist())

    return self_sorted_blocks.equals(other_sorted_blocks)
```

Explanation:
- The buggy function failed to correctly compare the blocks within the BlockManager objects. This caused it to incorrectly return True for cases where the blocks had different locations but were otherwise identical.
- The corrected version first consolidates the BlockManager objects to ensure that they are internally sorted and structured in the same way.
- Then, the function compares the sorted blocks using the `equals` method to accurately determine if the two BlockManager objects are equal.

By making these changes, the corrected function should address the issue and correctly compare the BlockManager objects.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
