The issue with the `equals` function is that it fails to correctly compare DataFrames due to the way it compares the blocks. The error message shows that the function is returning `True` instead of the expected `False` for two DataFrames that are clearly not equal.

The bug seems to be related to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function and comparing them, which is causing the incorrect output. In the given GitHub issue, the user expects the comparison of `df3.equals(df4)` to return `False`, but it is returning `True` instead.

To fix this bug, we can change the `canonicalize` function to just use the block's dtype and values to differentiate between blocks. Then, we can modify the comparison logic to correctly compare the sorted blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the block's dtype and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and return the expected result of `False` for the comparison of `df3.equals(df4)` as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
