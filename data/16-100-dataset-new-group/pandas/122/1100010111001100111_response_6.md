The bug in the `equals` function causes it to return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is based on the block contents rather than their locations. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        (self_blocks[i] == other_blocks[i]).all() for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```

In this corrected version, the function directly compares the `values` of the block objects instead of using their locations, which resolves the issue reported in GitHub. This change ensures that the equality comparison is based on the block contents, thus producing the expected result.

I also updated the comparison of the axes to compare their content directly, using the `equals` method.

This should fix the bug and allow the failing test case to pass.
