There are a few issues with the buggy function `equals`:
1. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the `BlockManager` class and once inside. This can lead to confusion about which `canonicalize` function is being called.
2. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, but it seems to have a couple of issues such as not taking into account different data types when sorting the blocks.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function and use the one inside the `BlockManager` class.
2. Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the data type of the block when creating the tuple for sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With these changes, the function should pass the failing test.
