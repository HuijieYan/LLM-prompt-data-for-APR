Looking at the buggy equals function in the BlockManager class, we can see that the function is intended to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two BlockManager objects to determine if they are equal.

The bug in the function arises from the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function incorrectly uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a tuple for sorting. The `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` should be simply `block.mgr_locs` as `block.mgr_locs` is already a list and using `as_array.tolist()` is redundant and causes the incorrect sorting of blocks.

To fix this bug, remove `.as_array.tolist()` from `block.mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function. This will ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly based on their dtype and locations.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
