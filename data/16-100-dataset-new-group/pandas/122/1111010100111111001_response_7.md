The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare `BlockManager` objects for equality but is failing to do so. The error message from the failing test indicates that the returned value is `True` instead of the expected `False`. This indicates that the function is incorrectly evaluating the equality between the two `BlockManager` objects.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of variables provided, it can be seen that the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects is not being done correctly.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function makes use of the `equals` method for the blocks, but the comparison logic used is incorrect, leading to the incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects should be reviewed and corrected to accurately compare the contents of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
            if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
                return False
        
        return True
```

In the corrected version, after checking the lengths and axes for equality, a loop iterates over each block in `self.blocks` and compares it with the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. If any block is found to be unequal, the function returns `False`. If all comparisons pass, the function returns `True`.
