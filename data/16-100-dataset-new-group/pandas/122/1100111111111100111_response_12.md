### Bug Explanation
The `equals` function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. This is causing the function to return `True` when it should return `False`, ultimately failing the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()`.

The specific issue lies in the way the `canonicalize` function is being used to sort the blocks. The `mgr_locs` attribute within the `Block` class is not being handled correctly, leading to the comparisons not working as intended.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute and the sorting of blocks. Additionally, the comparison logic within the `equals` function should be revised to ensure it accurately compares the blocks for equality.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version makes use of the `mgr_locs` and `values` attributes within the `Block` class to properly compare the blocks. The `canonicalize` function now takes these attributes into account when sorting the blocks, ensuring an accurate comparison for equality.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
