To fix the buggy function, we need to identify the cause of the error. The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" is expecting `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` to return `True is False` but it's not doing it. The error message indicates that the failing assertion is on the `equals` method of the DataFrame `df1`.

Looking at the `equals` function, we can see that the function compares `self_axes` and `other_axes` first, and then compares `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The bug might be in the comparison of the blocks. It's also possible that the bug is in the comparison of axes.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to make sure that the block comparison is correctly implemented. Also, the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` should be accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self._consolidate_inplace()
    other_blocks = other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison of blocks is done correctly and also consolidates the blocks before comparison. It also sorts the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs before comparison to ensure consistent ordering.

With these changes, the corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
