### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is the "equals" method within a class. The method is used to compare two instances of the class and determine if they are equal. The issue on GitHub describes a problem where the "equals" method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. The runtime input/output values provided reveal the values and types of variables within the function, leading to the observed bug.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error is likely in the comparison of self_blocks and other_blocks using the "equals" method. It seems that the "equals" method does not handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations properly.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the "equals" method does not account for the locations of identical blocks while comparing self_blocks and other_blocks. This results in the wrong determination of their equality.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the "equals" method needs to be updated to appropriately handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. This may involve modifying the comparison logic or including a step to consider the block locations in the comparison process.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and (block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the "equals" method now includes an additional condition to compare the block locations in addition to the regular comparison. This addresses the issue of wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
