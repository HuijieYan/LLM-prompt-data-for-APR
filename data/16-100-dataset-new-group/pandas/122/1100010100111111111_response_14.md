The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `managers.py` file of the pandas library. The `equals` method is intended to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. However, it is incorrectly returning True for cases where the blocks have identical data but different locations.

The potential error locations in the buggy function include the comparison of the BlockManager axes and blocks, as well as the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method does not properly handle cases where the blocks have the same data but different locations. This leads to incorrect comparisons and the function returning True when it should return False.

To fix the bug, the sorting of the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function should be modified to consider both the data type and the block location. Additionally, the comparison of the axes and blocks should be adjusted to properly account for the block location differences.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block data and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly compare BlockManager objects and return the expected result, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
