## Bug Explanation
The `equals` function is expected to return `True` only if `self` and `other` are equal in every element, and in the same order. However, the bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

In the provided source code, the bug is likely to occur in the section where the function sorts `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting process is meant to ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations do not cause the `equals` function to return `False`, but it is currently implemented incorrectly.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function, which should prioritize the block type name and manager locations. The current implementation does not properly reflect this behavior, causing the bug to occur.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to properly prioritize the block type name and manager locations in the sorting process. Additionally, the comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists should be adjusted to consider identical data with different locations as equal.

The corrected `canonicalize` function should create a tuple containing the block's type name and manager locations and use it for sorting purposes. Furthermore, the comparison of blocks should be updated to consider identical data with different locations as equal.

## Corrected Function
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block.values.shape == oblock.values.shape and
            (block.values == oblock.values).all() 
            for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected function, the `canonicalize` function now creates a tuple containing the block's type name and manager locations. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is based on this tuple, ensuring that blocks with identical data but different locations are considered equal. Additionally, the comparison of blocks now considers the shape and data equality of the blocks to accurately determine equality.
