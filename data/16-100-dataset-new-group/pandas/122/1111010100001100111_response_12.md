The bug in the `equals` function is causing the method to return incorrect results when comparing two BlockManager objects, leading to unexpected behavior. The bug appears to be related to the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager.

The main issue seems to stem from the sorting and comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The canonicalization function `canonicalize` is not properly handling the comparison of the blocks, resulting in a faulty equality check.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the comparison of the blocks based on their type name and their manager locations. Additionally, we need to ensure that the comparison logic between the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is accurately comparing the blocks and returning the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the type name and manager locations in the comparison, and adjusting the block comparison logic, we should be able to address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result for comparing two BlockManager objects.
