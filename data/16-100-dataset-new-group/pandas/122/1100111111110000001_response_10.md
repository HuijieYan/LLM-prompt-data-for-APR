The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is not comparing two dataframes correctly and is failing the test. It appears that the function is not sorting the blocks of the dataframes properly before performing the comparison, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we can sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` dataframes using the `canonicalize` function before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function should now properly sort the blocks of the dataframes using the `canonicalize` function before performing the comparison, thus passing the failing test.
