The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes, blocks, and their corresponding locations. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is returning incorrect results for certain cases. 

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`
2. The consolidation of the blocks using `_consolidate_inplace` method
3. The canonicalization of blocks using the `canonicalize` function
4. The comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`

The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison of different block locations, which leads to incorrect results. The issue reported on GitHub specifically mentions that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in such a way that it considers the block locations properly. We can achieve this by refining the canonicalization process and incorporating the block locations into the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name, mgr_locs, and block data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block values along with the type name and the manager locations. This change ensures that the comparison process accounts for the block locations and their data in order to provide correct results.

By making these modifications, the corrected function addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the comparison of `BlockManager` instances produces the expected results.
