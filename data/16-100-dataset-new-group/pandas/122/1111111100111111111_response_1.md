The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should return `False`. This is happening because the function is comparing the blocks in a particular order, using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their type and `mgr_locs`. However, the `canonicalize` function is not actually defined inside the `BlockManager` class, which means the comparison is not working as intended. 

To fix this bug, we need to define the `canonicalize` function inside the `BlockManager` class. Then use it to sort the blocks before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function inside the BlockManager class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By defining the `canonicalize` function inside the `BlockManager` class, it will be accessible to the `equals` function and can be used to correctly sort and compare the blocks. This should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function return the correct result.
