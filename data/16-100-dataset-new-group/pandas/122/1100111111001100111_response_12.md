The buggy function `equals` contains a logical error that causes it to return incorrect results. The function is called on two dataframes `df1` and `df2`, which are expected to be considered not equal, but the function wrongly returns `True`. The issue arises from the comparison of blocks in the dataframes that have identical content but reside in different locations. This behavior is contrary to the expected output and is flagged in the GitHub issue.

Based on the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, the bug in the function arises from the following areas:
1. The comparison of the blocks does not account for their locations, leading to incorrect determination of equality.
2. The use of `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks is ineffective for distinguishing between unconsolidated blocks with identical content but different locations.
3. There is an inconsistency in the call of the `canonicalize` function.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Modify the comparison of blocks to account for their locations, ensuring that identical content but different locations are not considered equal.
2. Re-implement the `canonicalize` function to accurately distinguish between blocks with identical content but different locations.
3. Ensure consistent usage of the `canonicalize` function.

Based on the above analysis, the corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.axes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `canonicalize` function is modified to consider both the block content and axes to facilitate proper sorting and comparison. Additionally, the comparison process now accounts for the block's axes as well as its values to accurately determine equality.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function ensures that dataframes with identical block content but different locations are correctly identified as not equal, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
