The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of block locations when checking for equality between two BlockManager objects.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block location information in the canonicalization process. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations are properly distinguished.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # ... (other functions)

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
