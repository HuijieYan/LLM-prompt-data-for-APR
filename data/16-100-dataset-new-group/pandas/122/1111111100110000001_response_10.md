The buggy function takes two instances of the `BlockManager` class 'self' and 'other' as input and compares them to check if they are equal. The error message from the failing test is indicating that the test case `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing. The error message shows that the comparison returns `True` instead of `False`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison logic inside the function might be faulty.
2. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice in the same class, which might be causing confusion.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic in the `equals` function is not correctly identifying the differences between the two instances of the `BlockManager` class. Additionally, there is a duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function within the same class, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Modify the comparison logic inside the `equals` function to correctly identify differences between the two instances.
2. Remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. The duplicate `canonicalize` function is removed.
2. The `canonicalize_block` function is defined within the `equals` function to ensure uniqueness.
3. The `canonicalize` function is now used to correctly order and compare the blocks, addressing the faulty comparison logic.
