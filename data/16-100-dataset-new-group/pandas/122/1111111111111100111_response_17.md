To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Analyzing the buggy function, we can see that it compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal.
2. The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison of the blocks, and the function `canonicalize` which is not properly defined.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two dataframes with different values, expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return False, but it fails with an assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is performed correctly. We should also define the `canonicalize` function properly to provide the expected block order.
5. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    # Compare the axes of the two BlockManager objects
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define the canonicalize function to reorder the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    # Sort the blocks based on canonicalization
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare each pair of blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
