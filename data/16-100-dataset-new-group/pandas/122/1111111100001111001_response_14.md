The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists. When sorting the blocks, the `canonicalize` function is used, which creates a tuple using the block's dtype name and the `mgr_locs` attribute. However, the bug might be occurring if the `mgr_locs` attribute is not being properly accessed or if it's not being sorted correctly.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the `mgr_locs` attribute is properly accessed and sorted. Additionally, it would be helpful to ensure that the `canonicalize` function is correctly returning a unique identifier for each block, allowing them to be sorted accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple with the `dtype` converted to a string and the `mgr_locs` directly used. This change should address any potential issues with the sorting of the blocks.
