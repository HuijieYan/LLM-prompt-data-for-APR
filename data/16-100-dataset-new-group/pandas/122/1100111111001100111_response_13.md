The bug existing in the `equals` function may cause it to return `True` when the expected output should be `False`. The bug exists due to the function not correctly identifying identical blocks with different locations. The incorrect handling of block location may result in unexpected behavior in cases where the blocks are identical but arranged differently in the DataFrame.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function needs to be corrected to compare the blocks based on their content rather than based on the location of the blocks. The comparison should ensure that the content of each block in `self.blocks` is equivalent to the content of the corresponding block in `other.blocks`.

A corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    # Check if the axes are the same
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks in both BlockManager instances based on content, regardless of their location
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())

    # Check if the sorted blocks are equal
    if self_blocks != other_blocks:
        return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks based on their content, ensuring that it returns the expected output of `False` for the failing test case.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug by properly comparing DataFrame blocks regardless of their location.
