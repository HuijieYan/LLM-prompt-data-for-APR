The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of block locations when sorting the blocks. The issue can be fixed by ensuring that the comparison includes the block location information. 

In the provided runtime input/output values for Case 1, the `canonicalize` function is used to create a tuple that combines the type name and then `mgr_locs`. However, the `mgr_locs` are not being converted to a list, which leads to the bug. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function is supposed to be from the class `BlockManager` since it is used by the `equals` function within that class. 

To address the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be corrected to properly convert `mgr_locs` to a list using the `.tolist()` method. Furthermore, the function should be defined within the `BlockManager` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.base import PandasObject

# The corrected version of the equals function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # ... (Other functions within the BlockManager class)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Corrected canonicalize function within the BlockManager class
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())  # Convert mgr_locs to a list

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will now properly compare the block locations and return the expected result, resolving the issue originally posted on GitHub.
