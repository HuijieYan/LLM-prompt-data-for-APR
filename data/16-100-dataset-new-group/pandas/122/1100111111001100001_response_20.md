The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the lengths of self.blocks and other.blocks may not be accurate.
2. The sorting of self.blocks and other.blocks using the canonicalize function could be causing inconsistencies.
3. The canonicalize function may not be correctly generating unique identifiers for each block.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic in the equals function is flawed, and the sorting using the canonicalize function is generating incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison and sorting logic to ensure accurate comparisons and sorting of blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the buggy function should pass the failing test.
