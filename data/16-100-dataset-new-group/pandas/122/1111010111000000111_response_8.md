## Correction

The issue with the `equals` function is that it wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. In the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, it is expected that `df1.equals(df2)` returns False, but it currently returns True.

The bug is caused by the `equals` function not handling the case of identical blocks with different locations properly. When comparing the blocks, it should take into consideration the block locations as well.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
   
    # Canonicalize block order, including block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            hash(block.values.tobytes()),
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(),
        )
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the hash of the block values and the block locations as part of the canonicalization process. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations will be treated as distinct.

This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function return the expected result.
