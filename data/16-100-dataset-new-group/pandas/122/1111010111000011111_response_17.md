# The buggy function has a comparison error in the equals method, where it wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the equals method to properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # other class attributes and methods...

    # the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        # sort blocks by canonicalized key
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # compare sorted blocks
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if not block.equals(oblock):
                return False
        
        return True
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by properly comparing the sorted blocks using a canonicalized key, ensuring that the function handles the comparison of blocks with different locations correctly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
