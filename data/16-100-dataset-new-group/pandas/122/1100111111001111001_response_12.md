The bug in the `equals` function is that the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once inside the `BlockManager` class and once outside the class. This causes an issue when the canonicalization is called, as it defaults to using the outer `canonicalize` function instead of the one defined within the `BlockManager` class. To fix this bug, we need to remove the outer `canonicalize` function and use the one defined within the class.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the outer `canonicalize` function and using the one defined within the `BlockManager` class, we ensure that the correct canonicalization is applied, and the function should now pass the failing test.
