The issue with the buggy function `equals` is that it wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to throw an AssertionError because it expects the function to return False, but it returns True instead.

The bug is likely related to the comparison of blocks between two DataFrames. A potential cause of the bug is the canonicalization of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which may not accurately distinguish between identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the comparison process accurately identifies the differences between the blocks. This can be achieved by revising the canonicalization logic to properly differentiate between blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks in the same order
    return all(
        self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self.blocks))
    )
```
In this corrected version, the comparison process directly iterates over the blocks, ensuring that the blocks from the two DataFrames are compared in the same order. This addresses the issue of identical blocks with different locations incorrectly being identified as equal.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass as expected.
