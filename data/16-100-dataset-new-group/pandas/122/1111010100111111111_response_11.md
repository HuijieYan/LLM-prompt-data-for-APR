The cause of the bug in the equals function is that it is not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of the two BlockManager instances. This leads to incorrect comparison results, as shown in the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the axes and blocks of the two BlockManager instances are compared properly. We can achieve this by comparing the axes and blocks individually, ensuring that they are equivalent in both instances.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version will compare the axes and blocks of the two BlockManager instances individually and ensure that they are equivalent. This will address the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
