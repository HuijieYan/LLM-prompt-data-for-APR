The bug in the `equals` function causes it to incorrectly return True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the case where the order of columns is different between the two DataFrames. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the values in the DataFrames rather than just checking the block order. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not all(self.columns == other.columns):
        return False
    if not self.index.equals(other.index):
        return False
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

With this corrected function, we are comparing the column names, index, and values of the DataFrames to ensure that they are truly identical. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
