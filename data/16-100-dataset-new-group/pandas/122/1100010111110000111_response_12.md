To fix the bug in the equals method, we need to address the issue of identical blocks with different locations erroneously returning True. The issue is that the function does not properly account for different block locations when determining equality.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # changed from block.dtype.name to block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version uses the values of the block instead of the dtype.name when canonicalizing the block order, which addresses the issue of different locations.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub regarding DataFrame.equals() wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.
