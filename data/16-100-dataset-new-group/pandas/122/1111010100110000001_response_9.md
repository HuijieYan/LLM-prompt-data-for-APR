The bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class is causing the test to fail. The error message indicates that the DataFrame equals method is not giving the correct output. Upon inspection, it's clear that the equals method implementation in the BlockManager class is not correctly comparing the values.

The bug is caused by the equals method not comparing the actual values of the DataFrames df1 and df2. Instead, it is comparing object references, leading to the incorrect assertion.

To fix the bug, the equals method should compare the values of the DataFrames instead of their object references.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare the actual values of the blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected implementation, the equals method should now correctly compare the values of the DataFrames and pass the failing test.
