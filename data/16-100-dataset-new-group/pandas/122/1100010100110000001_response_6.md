The issue with the buggy function is that it is failing to compare two DataFrames correctly and is returning the wrong output. The failing test is showing that the method `equals` is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of the DataFrames is not being performed correctly due to the sorting and comparison of their blocks.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the way the DataFrames and their blocks are being compared and sorted. Specifically, we need to ensure that the comparison takes into account the ordering of the elements within the DataFrames and their blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_equals(block, oblock):
        if isinstance(block, type(oblock)):
            return block.equals(oblock)
        else:
            return False

    return all(
        block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and correctly compare the two DataFrames to determine if they are equal or not.
