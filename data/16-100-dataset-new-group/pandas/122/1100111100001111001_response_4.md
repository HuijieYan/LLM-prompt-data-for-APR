The bug in the provided function seems to be in the canonicalization of the blocks. The canonicalization function is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect comparison of blocks.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the canonicalize function to correctly define the order of the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. Then, use this modified canonicalize function to sort the self_blocks and other_blocks before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the provided corrected version of the function, the canonicalize function has been modified to return a tuple containing the string representation of the dtype and mgr_locs of a block. Then, the self_blocks and other_blocks are sorted using this modified canonicalize function before comparing them.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
