To fix the bug, it seems like the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once outside the `BlockManager` class and once inside it. This can lead to confusion and incorrect behavior. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function should be extracting the values to perform the comparison rather than comparing object references. 

The corrected function should also consider the block labels when comparing blocks, not just data equality.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.indexer,
            block.mgr_locs.dense,
            block.mgr_locs.sliced,
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this corrected version, the function `equals` should now return the expected value of `False` for the failing test.
