To fix the bug in the equals function, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks and their contents is done correctly. The issue causing the failing test is that the equals function is returning True when it should be False due to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks in the BlockManager. The function sorts the blocks based on their type and location, but it seems to be comparing them incorrectly afterward.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to review the sorting and comparison logic within the equals function. Additionally, it may be necessary to revisit the implementations of the canonicalize function and the corresponding logic for comparing the blocks. The comparison should account for identical blocks with different locations, ensuring that the equals function returns the correct boolean value for DataFrame comparisons.

Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and 
    # the block contents
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the equals function includes a revised sorting and comparison logic. The canonicalize function now uses the block values and their locations to create a unique identifier for each block. This allows for correct sorting and comparison of the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are properly handled.

This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the equals function returns the expected boolean value for DataFrame comparisons.
