The bug in the equals function is likely caused by the sorting of the blocks using the canonicalize function. This sorting might result in different block orders between the two dataframes, leading to a false negative for equality check.

To fix the bug, the sorting based on canonicalize function should be removed. Instead, the function should check for equality of blocks directly without altering their order.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    return all(block.equals(other.blocks[i]) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks))
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test provided.
