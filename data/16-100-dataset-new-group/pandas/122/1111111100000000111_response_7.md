The buggy function `equals` is a method within the `BlockManager` class in the file pandas/core/internals/managers.py. The function is meant to compare two BlockManager objects to check if they are equal. However, the issue reported on GitHub mentions that the function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison logic for `self_axes` and `other_axes`
2. The canonicalization of blocks and comparing them

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle identical blocks with different locations correctly. This is likely due to the comparison logic and the canonicalization process where the blocks are sorted.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be modified to properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create a dictionary representation of the blocks within each BlockManager
    self_blocks_dict = {block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(): block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks_dict = {block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(): block for block in other.blocks}

    # Check if the set of block keys are the same for both BlockManagers
    if set(self_blocks_dict.keys()) != set(other_blocks_dict.keys()):
        return False

    # Check if the values of each block in both BlockManagers are equal
    for key in self_blocks_dict:
        if not self_blocks_dict[key].equals(other_blocks_dict[key]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we create dictionary representations of the blocks within each BlockManager, using the block's locations as keys. We then compare the set of keys to ensure that they are the same for both BlockManagers. Finally, we iterate through each key and check if the values of each block in both BlockManagers are equal. If all comparisons pass, we return True indicating that the BlockManagers are equal.
