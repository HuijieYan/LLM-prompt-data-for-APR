To fix the bug, we need to focus on the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations, `equals` wrongly returns True instead of False. 

Upon analyzing the `equals` function, the bug appears to be related to the sorting of blocks using `canonicalize` function. This causes identical blocks with different locations to be wrongly evaluated as equal.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to take into account the order of the blocks as well. This way, identical blocks with different locations will no longer be mistakenly evaluated as equal.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.index.asi8, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `equals` function should correctly handle the comparison of DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This corrected version should satisfy the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
