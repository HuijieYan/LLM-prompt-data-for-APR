## Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to check whether two sets of data are equal, but there are several potential error locations within the function. 

1. The use of `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` could be causing unintended side effects in the data.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function might not be comparing the data correctly.
3. There could be errors in the `equals` method of the `block` objects.

## Bug Cause:
The bug could arise from inconsistencies in the data due to the `consolidate_inplace` method and the sorting method used to compare the blocks. It's also possible that the `equals` method of the `block` objects is not working as intended.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data is compared accurately and without unintended side effects. The use of `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` should be carefully examined to ensure they are necessary and do not introduce problems. The sorting method should also be reviewed to confirm that it accurately compares the data. Finally, the `equals` method in the `block` objects should be checked for correctness.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
In the corrected version, we removed the `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` calls to prevent unintended side effects on the data. We simplified the sorting process by just comparing the blocks directly. We also changed the comparison to use the `values` attribute of the blocks for a more direct comparison.
