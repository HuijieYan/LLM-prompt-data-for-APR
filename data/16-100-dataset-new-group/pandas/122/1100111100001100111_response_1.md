## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return True incorrectly in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is happening because the function is not correctly comparing the blocks and their locations during the comparison process.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The `equals` function needs to be modified to compare the blocks and their locations correctly. This can be done by implementing a method to compare the blocks based on their content and location, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly identified as equal.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    # Compare the axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the block's content and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    # Sort the blocks by canonicalized order
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare each block and its location
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and loc1 == loc2 
        for (block, loc1), (oblock, loc2) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between blocks is extended to also compare their respective locations. This ensures that blocks with different locations are not mistakenly identified as equal, addressing the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
