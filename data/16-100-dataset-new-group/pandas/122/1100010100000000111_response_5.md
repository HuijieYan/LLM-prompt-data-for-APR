Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of blocks using the equals() method may not be accurate.
2. The canonicalize function might not be correctly sorting the blocks.

Cause of the bug:
The equals() function is not correctly comparing DataFrames due to the way it handles the comparison of blocks with different locations. This results in the function returning True when it should return False, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the comparison of blocks to properly handle cases where blocks have different locations.
- Ensure that the canonicalize function correctly sorts the blocks to facilitate accurate comparison.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Sort by block values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)  # Compare block values
    )
```

In the above corrected version, I've updated the canonicalize function to sort the blocks by their values and removed the use of the equals() method for block comparison. Instead, I directly compare the block values to ensure accurate comparison and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
