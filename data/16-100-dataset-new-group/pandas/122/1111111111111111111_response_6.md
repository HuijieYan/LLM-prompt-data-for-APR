Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self._get_block_manager_axis(0), other._get_block_manager_axis(0)
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.flatten().astype(str).tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The `equals` function has been corrected to use the `_get_block_manager_axis` method to access the axes of the block manager. Additionally, in the `canonicalize` function, the `mgr_locs` are flattened and converted to a list of strings to ensure consistent comparison.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes.
