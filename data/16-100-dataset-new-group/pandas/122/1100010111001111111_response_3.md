The buggy function appears to be the `equals` method in the `managers.py` file of the `pandas` library. The test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` fails because the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion returns `True` instead of `False`, which is the expected result. The `equals` method itself compares two `BlockManager` objects containing different types of data. The failure occurs because the method does not properly consider the data types when performing the equality check.

The failure seems to stem from the `equals` method not handling the comparison of different data types in the `BlockManager` blocks, leading to the incorrect result in the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test case. This is evident from the provided runtime and expected values and types, which show that the `equals` method fails to properly compare the internal blocks in the `BlockManager` objects, resulting in an incorrect equality evaluation.

To fix this bug, the `equals` method should be modified to consider the data types of the internal blocks before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        type(block).equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the data type, dtype name, and mgr_locs of the block. These factors are used to properly distinguish the blocks when sorting and comparing them in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks is performed using the `equals` method specific to their type.

With this correction, the `equals` method should now properly handle the comparison of different data types in the `BlockManager` objects, and the failing test case should return the expected result of `False` when checking the inequality of the `DataFrame` objects.
