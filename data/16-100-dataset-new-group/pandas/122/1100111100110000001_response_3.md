The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects and check if they are equal. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This means there is a logical flaw in the buggy function's implementation. 

The cause of the bug revolves around the comparison of the data frames. The `_consolidate_inplace` method is called on `self` and `other`, but the function `_consolidate_inplace` is not defined within the `BlockManager` class, causing a AttributeError. Additionally, the `canonicalize` method needs to be called with `self.canonicalize`. 

The strategy for fixing the bug can be to:
1. Define the `_consolidate_inplace` method within the `BlockManager` class to consolidate the data.
2. Change the `canonicalize` method calls to `self.canonicalize` for consistency and to avoid the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    # other methods...

    # this is the corrected function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` objects and the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass.
