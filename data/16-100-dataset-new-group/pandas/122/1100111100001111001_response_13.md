The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the sorting of blocks within the BlockManager. The function `canonicalize` is used to order the blocks based on their type and manager locations, but it is defined both within the class and outside the class, which might be causing confusion. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function should take the `BlockManager` as an argument, as it is using attributes and methods of the `block` object that are specific to the `BlockManager` class.

To fix the bug, we need to:
- Define the `canonicalize` function within the `BlockManager` class.
- Pass the `block` as an argument to the `canonicalize` function.
- Use the correct attributes and methods of the `block` object to sort the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other methods of the BlockManager

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Define the canonicalize function within the class
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x))
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is defined within the `BlockManager` class, and it takes the `block` as an argument to sort the blocks based on their type and manager locations. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output.
