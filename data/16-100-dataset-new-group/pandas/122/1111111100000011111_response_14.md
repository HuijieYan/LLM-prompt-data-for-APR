The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to compare two instances of BlockManager and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise. However, the function incorrectly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering the block locations.
2. Sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based only on `block.dtype.name` without considering the block locations.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly consider the block locations when comparing the two instances. As a result, it returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` function to consider the block locations when comparing the blocks. We can achieve this by including the block locations in the sorting criteria and comparison process.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block locations in the sorting criteria, and the comparison process compares the blocks including their locations.

This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and accurately compare the two instances of BlockManager.
