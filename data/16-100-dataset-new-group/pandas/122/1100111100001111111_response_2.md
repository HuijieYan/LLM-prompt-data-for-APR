## Fixing the bug

The bug occurs when the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two block managers with identical blocks but different locations. To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's data location when sorting the blocks.

Additionally, the function should return `False` if the lengths of the blocks differ.

We can make the following changes to address these issues:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Include data locations when canonicalizing blocks
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
With these modifications, the `equals` function will correctly compare the blocks within the block managers, taking into account the block locations along with their types for canonicalization.

The correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and accurately return `False` when comparing block managers with identical blocks but different locations.
