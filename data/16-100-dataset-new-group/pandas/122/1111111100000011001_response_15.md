The bug in the `equals` function is that it is not correctly comparing the blocks of data between `self` and `other`. The function is intended to compare the internal blocks of data within the `BlockManager` class, but it fails to do so due to incorrect sorting and comparison logic.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the comparison of blocks is done correctly by considering the dtype and mgr_locs of each block.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs))
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their dtype and mgr_locs before comparison, which aligns with the intended logic of the function.
