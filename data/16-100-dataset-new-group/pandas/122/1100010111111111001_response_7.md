The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two block managers for equality. However, the function is not handling the comparison of the individual blocks correctly, leading to the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly compare the blocks within the block managers when the `equals` method is called. This leads to the incorrect assertion that `True` is equal to `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` method properly handles the comparison of individual blocks within the block managers.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block_name in self.blocks:
        self_block = self.blocks[block_name]
        other_block = other.blocks[block_name]
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` method iterates through the blocks within the block managers and compares them individually, returning `True` if they are all equal and `False` otherwise. This approach ensures that the comparison of individual blocks is correctly handled.
