## Fixes

### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects, specifically the blocks they contain. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect comparison of blocks when the block order is not canonicalized.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, and it expects them to be unequal due to the difference in element positions, but it wrongly returns True.
3. The GitHub issue reports the incorrect behavior of the `equals` method when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `sorted` functions with custom key functions to canonicalize the block order.
2. The comparison of blocks using `equals` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks due to non-canonicalized block order, which leads to `equals` incorrectly returning True even when the blocks are in different positions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Canonicalize the block order to ensure consistent positioning.
2. Update the comparison of blocks to consider their positions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        canonicalize = lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return len(self.blocks) == len(other.blocks) and all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
In the corrected version, the block order is canonicalized using a lambda function called `canonicalize`. The `as_array.tolist()` has been removed and a tuple is used directly. The comparison of blocks is updated to consider their relative positions.

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
