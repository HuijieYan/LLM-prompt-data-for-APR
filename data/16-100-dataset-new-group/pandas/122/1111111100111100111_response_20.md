## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class causes the method to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks but with different locations.

The root cause of the bug lies in the canonicalization of the block order. When sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, it uses the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block, which is dependent on the block's location. This causes the comparison to fail when blocks with the same data are placed differently.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to exclude the block's location when comparing blocks. One way to achieve this is to exclude the `mgr_locs` attribute from the tuple used for canonicalization.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update the canonicalize function to exclude block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
    
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to exclude block locations, we can compare the blocks based on their data type, which resolves the bug and ensures that the `equals` method returns the correct result.
