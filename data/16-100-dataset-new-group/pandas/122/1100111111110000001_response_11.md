The buggy function is the `equals()` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. It is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class, which represents the internal data structures of pandas DataFrames.

The bug in the `equals()` method is that it fails to compare DataFrames for equality based on their content. Instead, it attempts to compare the DataFrames based on their internal representation, leading to incorrect results.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file provides a specific example of how the `equals()` method fails. It creates two different DataFrames `df1` and `df2` and asserts that the `equals()` method should return `False` when comparing them. However, the current buggy implementation of the `equals()` method incorrectly returns `True`, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the `equals()` method should compare the actual content of the DataFrames instead of their internal representation. This can be achieved by comparing the values of the DataFrames directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the equals() method
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        return False
    return self.values.equals(other.values)
```

In this corrected version, the `equals()` method first checks if the `other` object is an instance of the same class as `self`, using the `isinstance()` function. Then, it directly compares the values of the DataFrames using the `equals()` method. This ensures that the comparison is based on the content of the DataFrames rather than their internal representation.
