This bug is causing the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. The error message is indicating that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, as expected.

The cause of the bug is the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and `mgr_locs`. If two blocks have the same content but different locations (unconsolidated blocks), they will be sorted as equal, leading to the `equals` method incorrectly evaluating DataFrames with different block locations as equal.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `mgr_locs` array itself, rather than converting it to a list. This will ensure that different block locations are now considered in the sorting process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `mgr_locs` array is included as a tuple in the `canonicalize` function. This ensures that blocks with the same content but different locations will be sorted as unequal, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
