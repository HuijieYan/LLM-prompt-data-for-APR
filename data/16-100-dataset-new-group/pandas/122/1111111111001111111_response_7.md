The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should return `False`, leading to failing tests and a reported GitHub issue. The issue occurs when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` where the columns have been swapped. 

The cause of the bug is likely in the way the function handles the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The `_consolidate_inplace` function is called on both `self` and `other` BlockManagers, but it may not be correctly consolidating the blocks for comparison. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function may not be properly ordering and comparing the blocks.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the blocks in both `self` and `other` BlockManagers are properly consolidated and ordered before comparing them. We also need to ensure that the comparison is done correctly for cases where the column order is different but the actual data is the same.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_equals(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.to_tuples()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.to_tuples()))

    return all(
        block_equals(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should properly handle the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager class and return the expected results for the failing test case. This fix should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
