The bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class lies in the sorting of the self_blocks and other_blocks using the canonicalize function, as well as the comparison of the sorted blocks. The bug may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the canonicalize function which is used to sort the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalize function correctly combines the type name and mgr_locs to distinguish between the blocks. Additionally, we need to ensure that the block comparison is done accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we've updated the canonicalize function to correctly combine the type name and mgr_locs for each block. We've also used the str() function to convert the dtype to a string for proper comparison. Additionally, the block comparison has been written to compare each block with its counterpart in the other Blocks and return False if any pair is not equal.
