Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `equals` function is causing the DataFrame `equals` method to return True when it should be returning False. This indicates that the comparison logic within the `equals` function is incorrect.

The code is sorting the blocks based on the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function. This should help in distinguishing between unconsolidated blocks. However, the block order is not canonicalized properly, leading to incorrect comparisons and the function returning True erroneously.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block order is properly canonicalized before comparing the blocks. This will involve correcting the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent comparison logic. The correct canonicalize function should return a tuple consisting of the block's type name and its sorted locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, sorted(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple containing the block's type name (retrieved via `type(block).__name__`) and the sorted locations of the block. This ensures that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

With this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the BlockManagers and return the expected output as described in the GitHub issue.
