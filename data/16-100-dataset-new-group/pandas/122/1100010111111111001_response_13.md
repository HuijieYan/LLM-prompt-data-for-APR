The bug in the given function is likely due to the comparison of blocks between two DataFrame objects. The bug causes the function to return `True` when two DataFrames are not equal, leading to a failed test.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames, ensuring that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # check if the blocks of the two DataFrames are equal
    for b1, b2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not b1.equals(b2):
            return False

    return True
```

With this correction, the function should now accurately compare the blocks of the two DataFrames, ensuring that the `equals` method correctly determines if the DataFrames are equal.
