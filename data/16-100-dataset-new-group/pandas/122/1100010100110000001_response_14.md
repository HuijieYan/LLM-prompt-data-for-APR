## Analysis
The buggy function is `equals` which is part of the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed. The error message also shows the difference between the two dataframes and how the `equals` method is being called, which can be helpful for fixing the bug.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. The use of `canonicalize` function to sort `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might cause an issue.
2. There might be a problem with the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using `equals` method.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. It appears that the sorting of the blocks using `canonicalize` and then comparison might not be working as expected, leading to a failure in the test.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
A potential fix could be to change the sorting and comparison strategy for the blocks. Instead of using a custom sorting function (`canonicalize`), a more straightforward approach might be to directly compare the blocks within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare the blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks within `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists without using a custom sorting function. It should pass the failing test.
