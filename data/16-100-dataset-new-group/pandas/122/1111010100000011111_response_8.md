There is a bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class within pandas that causes the method to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. The method compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances and returns `True` or `False` based on their equality.

The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks with different locations, resulting in a `True` return value when it should actually be `False`. This is confirmed by the GitHub issue where a simple test case failed to return the expected result of `False`.

To fix the bug, you need to modify the logic for comparing the blocks in the `equals` method to properly account for different block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version introduces the `values` attribute to the `canonicalize` function, capturing the values of the block in addition to their locations to properly compare them for equality. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` method return the expected results.
