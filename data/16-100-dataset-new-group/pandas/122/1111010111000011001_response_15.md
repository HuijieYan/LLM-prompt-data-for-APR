The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` objects. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is likely failing because the function is not comparing the blocks correctly.

It seems that the `canonicalize` function is trying to sort the blocks based on their data type and the positions in the manager (mgr_locs). However, the comparison of `mgr_locs` might not be working as intended.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the `mgr_locs` directly by converting it to a list. Then, we can compare the sorted blocks using the modified `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize block order to compare mgr_locs directly
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now compare the blocks correctly and pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
