The problem with the buggy function is that it's not properly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects. The function is comparing the blocks inside the self and other block managers by iterating through them with the `zip` function, sorting them by canonical order, and then comparing them. However, it's not considering the hierarchical structure of the blocks within the BlockManager.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly compares the blocks within the BlockManager objects taking into account their hierarchical structure.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the blocks within the BlockManager objects directly, ensuring that their hierarchical structure is properly considered in the comparison. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected result for the failing test case.
