The issue in the `equals` function is caused by the way the `canonicalize` function is dealing with the block order, leading to the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists, ultimately causing the `equals` function to return `True` when it should be `False`.

The `canonicalize` function is not correctly creating a unique representation for each block, leading to incorrect sorting of the blocks, which results in the incorrect comparison.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to create a unique representation for each block, ensuring that equal blocks always have the same representation.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now creates a unique representation for each block, ensuring that equal blocks always have the same representation. This should result in the `equals` function returning the correct result for the failing test case.
