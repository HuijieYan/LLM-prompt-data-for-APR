The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal. The function fails due to incorrect comparison of the block elements.

Analyzing the function runtime values and types of variables, we can see that the problem arises when comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager`. The code tries to consolidate the blocks, but the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function is not correct, leading to incorrect results.

The strategy to fix the bug is to correctly sort and compare the blocks and avoid the unnecessary consolidation of blocks within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks directly without unnecessary consolidation
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks directly without unnecessary consolidation and sorting, we avoid the error in the comparison, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
