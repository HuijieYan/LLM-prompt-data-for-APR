The buggy function `equals` is designed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances. However, there is a bug in the canonicalization step while sorting the blocks, which causes the comparison to fail.

The bug occurs in the `canonicalize` function where the `as_array` attribute of `mgr_locs` should be accessed directly, instead of calling `tolist()` on it.

To fix the bug, update the `canonicalize` function to directly access the `as_array` attribute of `mgr_locs`. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This correction should address the bug in the `equals` function and allow the failing test to pass.
