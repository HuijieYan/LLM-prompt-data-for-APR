Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison logic for the blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The `equals` function is mistakenly returning True for cases where the blocks have the same content but are stored in different places, while it should return False.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's content and their positions, and then use it to compare the blocks within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, block content, and mgr_locs to consider the block positions
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will correctly compare the content and positions of the blocks in the `BlockManager` class and return the expected result.

This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test case pass.
