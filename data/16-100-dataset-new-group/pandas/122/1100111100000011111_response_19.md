## Correction of the Bug

### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two BlockManager objects for equality. It seems to have an issue when comparing identical blocks with different locations. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks, but it may not be handling blocks with the same data but different locations correctly.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely to be in the sorting mechanism using the `canonicalize` function. The comparison between blocks might not be considering different locations for identical blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not differentiating between identical blocks with different locations, which leads to incorrect equality comparisons between BlockManager objects.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to consider both the type name and the locations of the blocks. Additionally, the sorting mechanism should be updated to consider the location of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to consider block type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)  # Include block values for differentiation

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block type (dtype.name) and the values of the blocks for differentiation. This will allow the sorting mechanism to differentiate between identical blocks with different locations.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and provide the expected output for the test case.
