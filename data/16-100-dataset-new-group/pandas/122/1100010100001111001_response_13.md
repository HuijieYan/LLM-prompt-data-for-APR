Given the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. It appears that the bug lies within the sorting of the blocks, using the `canonicalize` function.

The bug is causing the function to return an incorrect result when comparing the blocks between the two objects. The incorrect result is likely due to the wrong order of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists, resulting from the inappropriate sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be corrected to properly sort the blocks based on the dtype name and mgr_locs. Additionally, the comparison logic between the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists needs to be reviewed to ensure the correct equality check is performed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to effectively sort the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs, and ensuring the comparison logic properly compares the blocks between the two objects, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now produce the expected output.
