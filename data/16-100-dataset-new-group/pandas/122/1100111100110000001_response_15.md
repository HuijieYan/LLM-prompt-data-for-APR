The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module. This function is used to compare two BlockManager instances for equality.

The error message from the failing test indicates that when comparing two dataframes using the `equals` method, it is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is incorrect.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of axis lengths (`len(self_axes) != len(other_axes)`)
2. Consolidating the blocks in place using `_consolidate_inplace()` method
3. Sorting and comparing the individual blocks within the BlockManagers

The cause of the bug is that the code is not properly handling the comparison of the two dataframes. It is possible that the ordering and type of the blocks within the dataframes are causing the `equals` method to return `True` incorrectly.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to handle the comparison of the blocks more accurately and potentially use a different approach for comparing the individual blocks within the BlockManagers.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the individual blocks within the BlockManagers, ensuring that the comparison is accurate. This should address the issue and make the `equals` method work correctly for the given test case.
