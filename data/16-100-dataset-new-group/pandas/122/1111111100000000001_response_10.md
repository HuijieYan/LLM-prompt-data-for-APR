The buggy function is the "equals" method within the BlockManager class. The purpose of this method is to compare two BlockManager objects and their internal blocks for equality based on their axes and blocks.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the bug might be related to the comparison of axes and blocks between the two BlockManager objects. The method calls the "_consolidate_inplace" method of both self and other objects, and then it compares the blocks for equality using the "equals" method of each block. 

One potential cause of the bug could be that the "_consolidate_inplace" method may not be properly consolidating the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons in the later part of the function.

To fix the bug, the "_consolidate_inplace" method should be reviewed to ensure that it consolidates the blocks correctly. Additionally, it's important to review the logic used for comparing the blocks for equality, as there could be issues with how the blocks are sorted and compared.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

It's important to note that the corrective changes might also depend on how the other functions like "consolidate_inplace", "canonicalize" are implemented. So, thorough testing and validation of the changes should be carried out to ensure the correctness of the corrected version.
