The buggy function `equals` in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` to produce the error message:

```
E       assert True is False
E        +  where True = <bound method NDFrame.equals of    a  b\n0  1  s\n1  2  d>(   a  b\n0  s  1\n1  d  2)
E        +    where <bound method NDFrame.equals of    a  b\n0  1  s\n1  2  d> =    a  b\n0  1  s\n1  2  d.equals
```

This error is triggered because the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the two dataframes `df1` and `df2`. It is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing the two dataframes.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are the comparison of the dataframes and the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. 

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the dataframes `self` and `other`, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the dataframes `self` and `other`. We can do this by improving the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` and ensuring that the dataframes are being compared as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._shallow_copy().info_repr(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now produce the correct result when comparing the dataframes, and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any errors.
