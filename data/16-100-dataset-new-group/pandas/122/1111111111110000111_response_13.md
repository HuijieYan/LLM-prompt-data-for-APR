The buggy function fails to correctly compare two dataframes and returns True when they are not equal. This is due to the way the function handles the comparison of blocks between the two dataframes. The issue on GitHub confirms that the expected output is False, but the buggy function returns True. 

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the `canonicalize` function and the comparison of the blocks within the dataframes. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparison, but it seems to be producing incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks with the `canonicalize` function is done correctly, and that the comparison of the sorted blocks returns the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values_hash(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function uses `get_values_hash()` instead of `dtype.name` to sort the blocks. This should produce a more accurate comparison of the blocks, ensuring that the equals function returns the correct result.

After implementing this change, the function should correctly compare the two dataframes and return False as expected, passing the failing test and resolving the issue raised on GitHub.
