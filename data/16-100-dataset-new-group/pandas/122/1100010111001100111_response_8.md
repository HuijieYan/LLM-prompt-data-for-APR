Based on the provided information, the issue is related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returning True in the case of identical blocks with different locations. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` also expects the `equals` method to return False for the given input dataframes.

Upon analyzing the `equals` function and runtime values, the issue seems to be in the comparison of the blocks. It appears that the block comparison is not taking into account the location or order of the blocks. This is leading to incorrect results from the `equals` method.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison logic to include block locations. One approach could be to compare the blocks by both their content and their relative locations within the dataframe.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, list(block.items), list(block.mgr_locs.indexer))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block's dtype, mgr_locs, items, and mgr_locs.indexer. This ensures that the comparison involves the locations of the blocks as well.

With these changes, the corrected `equals` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
