Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, it seems that the `equals` method from the `BlockManager` class is returning incorrect results when comparing two DataFrames with different block locations but identical content. This is leading to wrong assertion results in the failing test case.

The cause of the bug in the `equals` method is that it is not handling the case where identical blocks have different locations. The `canonicalize` function that sorts and compares the blocks is not taking into account the different block locations, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to properly handle the case where identical blocks have different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks by a combination of their content and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account both the block content and their locations when sorting the blocks. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are properly handled in the equality comparison.

With this corrected version, the failing test case should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
