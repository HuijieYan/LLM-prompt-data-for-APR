The issue with the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks in `self` and `other`. The comparison is based on the order of the blocks which might be incorrect because the blocks could be unconsolidated and their iteration order may change. This can lead to a false positive in the comparison.

To fix the bug, we should consider comparing the blocks in a more robust way, taking into account the specific attributes of the blocks that make them unique. This could involve comparing the values of the blocks directly, as well as additional attributes that represent their uniqueness, such as the data type (dtype) and the block placement. 

We should also consider consolidating the blocks before making the comparison to ensure a consistent state for both `self` and `other`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
  
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
  
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and 
        block.dtype == oblock.dtype and 
        block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In this corrected version, we use the `values` attribute of the blocks to compare their content, and we compare the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` with each other. We sort the blocks based on these attributes to ensure a consistent and reliable comparison. Additionally, we consolidate the blocks before making the comparison.
