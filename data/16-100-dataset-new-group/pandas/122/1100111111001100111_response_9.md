The bug in the `equals` function is causing incorrect comparison results for DataFrames when blocks are identical but have different locations. The issue was originally reported on GitHub and the problem was identified as the `equals` function returning `True` when it should return `False` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.

The root cause of the bug lies in the comparison of blocks without considering the actual block locations. This results in the `equals` function returning `True` when it should not.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used within the `equals` function to take block locations into account. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified and compared.

A corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now considers block locations when comparing DataFrames, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified and compared. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
