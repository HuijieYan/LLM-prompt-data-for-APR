The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This behavior conflicts with the expected output and is reported as GitHub issue "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function needs to be updated to account for block locations and data types. Additionally, a sorting mechanism needs to be implemented to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers both the data type and the block locations.

To address the issue, the following corrected version of the `equals` function is provided:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers both the data type (`dtype`) and the block locations (`mgr_locs`) when sorting the blocks for comparison. This update ensures that the comparison accurately reflects the structure of the DataFrames and will yield the expected output when tested.
