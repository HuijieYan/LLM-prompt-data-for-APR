## Correction of the bug

### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two DataFrame objects to check if they are equal. However, the bug causes it to return `True` when the DataFrame objects have identical blocks with different locations, instead of returning `False` as expected.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with columns of different data types and values. The bug causes the comparison to erroneously pass and return `True` when it should return `False`.

The GitHub issue raises this bug and expects the function to return `False` in such cases.

### Bug Location:
The bug may stem from the implementation of the `equals` function where it compares the block components of the DataFrames without considering their locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the failure of the function to account for differences in the locations of data blocks when comparing DataFrames. This leads to incorrect comparison results, causing the failing test and the issue on GitHub.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to account for the locations of the data blocks when comparing the DataFrames. This can be achieved by introducing logic to consider block locations during the comparison process.

### Corrected Version:
Based on the analysis, the bug in the `equals` function can be fixed by updating the comparison logic to account for the locations of the data blocks. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Consider block locations in the comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.canonical_order().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a `canonicalize` function is included to consider the block locations by using the `canonical_order` method to ensure consistent ordering for comparison. This resolves the bug and ensures that DataFrames with identical blocks and different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

Implementing this fix will address the bug reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
