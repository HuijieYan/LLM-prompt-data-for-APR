The bug in the `equals` function seems to be caused by the comparisons of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, specifically in the sorting of these blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `block.dtype` and `block.mgr_locs` variables are not used in the comparisons, but they are declared and assigned before the return statement. Therefore, these variables should also be considered in the comparison.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function and include `block.dtype` and `block.mgr_locs` in the comparison. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple that includes the `dtype.name`, `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, and `values` of the block. This allows for more specific and accurate comparisons between the blocks, ensuring that all relevant attributes are considered.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
