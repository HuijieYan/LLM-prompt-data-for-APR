The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the `canonicalize` function being defined twice, leading to confusion about which version of the function is being called. Additionally, the sorting logic inside the `equals` function depends on the `canonicalize` function, which is not properly implemented.

To fix this bug, we can remove the duplicate `canonicalize` function definitions and properly implement the sorting logic inside the `equals` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs) for block in blocks]

    self_blocks = sorted(canonicalize(self.blocks))
    other_blocks = sorted(canonicalize(other.blocks))
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the duplicate `canonicalize` function and implemented the sorting logic using a single definition of `canonicalize` that returns a list of tuples. We then sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using this `canonicalize` function and compare the sorted lists for equality, which should resolve the bug.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
