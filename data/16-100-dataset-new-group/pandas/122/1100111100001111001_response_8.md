The bug in the provided function seems to be occurring when comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function is attempting to sort and compare the blocks in a way that might not be consistent with the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to provide a consistent and unique representation of each block for sorting. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `equals` method is called from the correct class prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a unique representation for sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
