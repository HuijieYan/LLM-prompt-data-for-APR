The buggy function `equals` is a method inside the `BlockManager` class. This function compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes, blocks, and block order. The potential error locations within the buggy function may be in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, and in the comparison of `block` and `oblock`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The bug might manifest as incorrect equality checks due to the way the blocks are sorted or compared.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to improve the canonicalization and sorting of the blocks to ensure that the comparison is accurate and consistent.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs._get_plane_array().tolist())
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` method has been replaced with `_get_plane_array().tolist()` to properly convert `mgr_locs` into a list. This should ensure that the canonicalization and sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are done correctly, addressing the potential bug.
