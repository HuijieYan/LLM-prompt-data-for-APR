## Buggy Function Analysis
The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of BlockManager for equality based on their axes and blocks. The function checks if the axes are equal and then proceeds to compare the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs. 
The bug in the current implementation seems to be in the way the `canonicalize` function is invoked and the way the blocks are sorted and compared.

The potential errors in the buggy function include:
1. Misuse of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method.
2. Improper validation of the axes equality.
3. Incorrect comparison of the blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not correctly implemented and invoked within the `equals` function. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs is flawed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correctly implement the `canonicalize` function.
2. Validate the equality of axes before proceeding with block comparison.
3. Sort and compare the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected function, the canonicalize function correctly returns the combination of dtype name and mgr_locs as a tuple. This ensures that the block comparison is accurate. Additionally, the function now validates the equality of axes before proceeding to block comparison.
