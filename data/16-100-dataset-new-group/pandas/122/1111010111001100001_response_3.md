The bug in the `equals` function seems to be with the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison is not implemented correctly, leading to the function returning an incorrect value.

The `canonicalize` function seems to be correctly implemented to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is implemented correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), type(block).__name__)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By changing the `canonicalize` function to include the block type name and sorting based on both the type name and `mgr_locs`, we ensure a correct comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function. This should fix the bug and make the test pass.
