### Analysis:
The `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is not functioning as expected. The method is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances and is failing to correctly identify cases where the blocks have identical contents but different locations.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional check of block equality seems to be the point where the issue arises.
2. The block canonicalization is not accurately identifying blocks with identical contents.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. As the GitHub issue states, the method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be revisited. Instead of relying solely on the block locations, the method should compare the actual content of the blocks to determine equality. Additionally, the canonicalization process needs to take into account the block contents to ensure accurate identification of identical blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare block contents by iterating over them
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares the actual contents of the blocks instead of relying solely on block locations. By iterating over the blocks and comparing their contents, it ensures that the method accurately determines equality. This corrected version should address the issue identified in the GitHub report and pass the failing test.
