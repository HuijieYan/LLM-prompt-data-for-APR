The buggy function is the equals() method within the BlockManager class. The function is used to check if a given BlockManager object is equal to another BlockManager object based on their axes and blocks.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the lengths of self_axes and other_axes.
2. The equality comparison of the individual axes using the equals() method.
3. The comparison of the lengths of self.blocks and other.blocks.
4. The sorting and comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks based on their type name and manager locations.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the comparison of block data correctly, which can lead to incorrect equality checks for BlockManager objects.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to first ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is implemented correctly, and use a systematic approach to compare the block data within the BlockManager objects.

Here's the corrected version of the equals() function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
            
    return True
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through each block in self.blocks and compares it with the corresponding block in other.blocks. If any block is found to be unequal, the function immediately returns False. If all blocks are found to be equal, the function returns True.
