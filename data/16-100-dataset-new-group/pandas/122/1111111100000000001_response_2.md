The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class. The function checks if the axes of the two instances are equal, then consolidates the internal data structure in place for both instances, and finally compares the blocks of the two instances to check for equality.

The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the axes may not be accurate.
2. Calling the `_consolidate_inplace` method on `self` and `other` may have side effects.
3. Sorting and comparing the blocks based on their data type and locations may not be correct.

The cause of the bug may be related to the comparison of the axes, potential side effects of `_consolidate_inplace` method, and the sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, a better approach is to compare the attributes of the two instances explicitly, without modifying any internal state. Also, it is important to ensure that the comparison logic for the blocks is accurate and does not have any side effects.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.shape != other.shape or self.ndim != other.ndim or self.items != other.items:
        return False

    for axis in self.axes:
        if axis not in other.axes:
            return False

    for axis in other.axes:
        if axis not in self.axes:
            return False

    for label, block in self.blocks.items():
        if label not in other.blocks or not block.equals(other.blocks[label]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly compare the shape, ndim, and items of the two instances. Then we iterate through the axes to ensure that they are the same for both instances. Lastly, we iterate through the blocks of `self` and compare them to the corresponding blocks of `other`. If any comparison fails, the function returns `False`. If all comparisons pass, the function returns `True`.
