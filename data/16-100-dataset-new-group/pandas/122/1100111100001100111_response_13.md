The bug in the function `equals` is causing it to return incorrect results when comparing two BlockManager instances. The issue reported on GitHub also confirms that the `equals` function is returning True when it should return False for identical blocks with different locations.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. When comparing the blocks, the function sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which uses the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is specific to the location of the block within the BlockManager, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should use a different approach to compare the blocks. Instead of relying on the `mgr_locs` attribute, it should implement a comparison based on the actual data within the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        self_block.values.equals(other_block.values) 
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the function compares the actual block values using the `equals` method of the values, ensuring that the comparison is based on the data content rather than the block locations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected results for the `equals` function.
