The buggy function compares two BlockManager objects to check if they are equal. It starts by comparing the axes of the two BlockManager objects. Then it consolidates the two objects in place and compares the number of blocks they have. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks.

The bug in the function is that it calls the `canonicalize` function but doesn't provide the `block` parameter when calling it from within the `equals` function. This results in a NameError and causes the function to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to pass the `block` parameter to the `canonicalize` function when calling it from within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the `block` parameter is passed when calling the `canonicalize` function. This should fix the bug and allow the function to run successfully.
