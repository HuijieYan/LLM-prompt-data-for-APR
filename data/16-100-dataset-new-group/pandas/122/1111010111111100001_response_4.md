The buggy function `equals` is failing to correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances. The function is comparing the attributes `self_axes` and `other_axes` but is not using them in the subsequent code, leading to a comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` directly.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not using the axes to correctly compare the blocks, which leads to mismatch in block order when comparing `self` and `other`. This causes the expected result to be `False`, but the actual result to be `True`.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to modify the `equals` function to use the axes to compare the blocks. This can be achieved by iterating over the axes and comparing the corresponding blocks based on their label.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
        self_block = self.blocks[ax1]
        other_block = other.blocks[ax2]
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function iterates over the axes and compares the corresponding blocks based on their label, ensuring the correct comparison of the `BlockManager` instances.
