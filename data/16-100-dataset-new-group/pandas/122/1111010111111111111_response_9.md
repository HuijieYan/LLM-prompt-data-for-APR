The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing two `BlockManager` objects. The bug causes the function to return `True` when it should return `False` for identical blocks with different locations.

The bug originates in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparing them. The bug occurs because the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` is not properly handled in the `canonicalize` function, causing the function to consider identical blocks with different locations as different.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to properly account for the `mgr_locs` attribute when sorting the blocks.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    # to account for different locations of identical blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute when sorting the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are properly considered equal.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the `equals` function behave as expected, passing the failing test and returning the correct output.
