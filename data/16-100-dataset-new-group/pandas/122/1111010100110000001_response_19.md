Potential error locations:
1. The comparison of the axes in the equals function.
2. The comparison of the blocks in the equals function.

Cause of the bug:
The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, and it shows that the comparison is resulting in `assert True is False`. This means that the `equals` function is returning True when it should be returning False. The bug is likely in the logic of the `equals` function where it compares the axes and blocks.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for comparing the axes to ensure that it correctly identifies if the axes are not equal.
2. Check the logic for comparing the blocks to ensure that it correctly identifies if the blocks are not equal.

Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block._typ, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
In the corrected version:
- Corrected the logic for comparing axes and fixed the `if` checks.
- Changed the approach for canonicalizing blocks and comparing them for equality.
