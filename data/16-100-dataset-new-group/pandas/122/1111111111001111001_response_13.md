The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, there is a bug in the function that prevents it from generating the expected output.

The bug occurs when trying to canonicalize block order by sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which is a nested function within the `equals` function. The issue arises from the failure to pass `block` as a parameter to the `canonicalize` function when it's called within the `equals` function. As a result, the `canonicalize` function throws an error because it expects a parameter.

To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to accept `block` as a parameter and pass the appropriate block to the `canonicalize` function when it is called.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modified canonicalize function to accept a block as a parameter
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Pass the appropriate block to the canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
