The bug in the function `equals` is causing it to fail the `test_dataframe_not_equal` test. The `equals` function is a member of the `BlockManager` class and is used to check for equality of two `BlockManager` objects, `self` and `other`. It is also calling several other functions from the same class such as `_consolidate_inplace` and `canonicalize`. 

One potential source of the bug could be in the implementation of the `equals` function itself, with issues in how it is comparing the blocks and ordering them for comparison.

The failing test is comparing two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, checking if they are equal. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` has raised an AssertionError, indicating that the `equals` method returned `True` when it was expected to return `False`.

To fix the bug, one strategy could be to focus on how the `canonicalize` function is being used to order the blocks. The ordering of the blocks may not be consistent, leading to unexpected results. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks within the `equals` function should also be carefully reviewed.

A corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the key function `canonicalize` uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()` to properly order the elements for comparison. This ensures that the blocks are sorted consistently before being compared. Additionally, this corrected implementation uses the `equals` method to compare each block within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists, ensuring that the comparison is performed correctly.
