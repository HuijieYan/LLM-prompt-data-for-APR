The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists. The function is supposed to check if the lists contain the same elements in the same order, but due to the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, it is possible for the function to return a false negative even if the blocks are equivalent.

To fix this bug, a more robust method of comparison should be used, such as directly comparing the elements of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists without any sorting.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```
By directly comparing the elements of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, without any sorting, we ensure that the comparison is based on the actual equality of the blocks rather than their sorted order.
