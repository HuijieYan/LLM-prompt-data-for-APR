### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` and is used to check if the internal block data structures of two `BlockManager` instances are equal. The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method, but it wrongly returns `True` instead of `False` even though the DataFrames have different values.

In the `equals` function, the bug seems to be related to the comparison of two `BlockManager` instances. The `canonicalize` function is intended to order the blocks for comparison, but it appears to be failing to correctly distinguish between the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. This results in the comparison returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The bug is causing the `equals` function to return `True` even when the data in the DataFrames is different, leading to failing tests and mismatched expectations.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by the `canonicalize` function's inability to correctly order the blocks for comparison. This results in an incorrect comparison when calling the `equals` function, as the order of the blocks is not being considered properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly orders the blocks in a way that reflects the actual data content. Additionally, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be reviewed to ensure that it accurately compares the ordered blocks and returns the correct result.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to use the block's locations (`mgr_locs`) as well as the data type name to order the blocks for comparison. This modification ensures that the blocks are correctly ordered based on their actual content, allowing for an accurate comparison.

Additionally, the blocks are sorted using the updated `canonicalize` function, and the comparison logic remains the same to compare the ordered blocks.

With these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances and return the expected result. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
