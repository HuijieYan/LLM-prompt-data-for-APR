The bug in the `equals` function is that it fails to consider the block locations when checking for equality between two DataFrames. This causes the function to return True even when the blocks have identical values but different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to account for block locations when checking for equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.is_sliced_like(other.blocks).tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The key change is in the `canonicalize` function, where we include the block locations when creating the canonical representation. This ensures that blocks with identical values but different locations will no longer be considered equal.

With this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly identify the blocks with different locations as unequal, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
