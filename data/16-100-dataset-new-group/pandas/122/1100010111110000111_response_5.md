The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. When comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, it should return `False` if the DataFrames are not identical. However, the function is not working as expected and incorrectly returns `True`.

The root cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function used within the `equals` function is not properly handling the sorting of blocks in the DataFrames. This leads to the incorrect comparison of the two DataFrames, causing the `equals` method to return `True` instead of `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly represent the block sorting order. After sorting the blocks using the updated `canonicalize` function, the `equals` function should be able to accurately compare the DataFrames and return the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now accurately compare the two DataFrames and return the expected result, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
