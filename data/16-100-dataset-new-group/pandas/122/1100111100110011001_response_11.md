The issue with the buggy function is likely related to incorrect comparison or sorting of the dataframe blocks.

In the failing test, the dataframe `df1` and `df2` have different values and types. The assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing with `assert True is False` which indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should have returned `False`.

The bug in the function might be due to how the blocks are being compared and sorted in the `equals` method.

A possible strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method takes into account the actual values within the blocks, rather than just their types or other attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Use the block values for comparison and sorting
    def get_block_values(block):
        return block.values

    self_block_values = [get_block_values(block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_values = [get_block_values(block) for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_block, other_block)
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self_block_values, other_block_values)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` method now compares the actual block values using `np.array_equal` to check for equality, rather than relying on block types or other attributes.
