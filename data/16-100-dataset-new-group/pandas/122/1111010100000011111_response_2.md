The cause of the bug in the `equals` function is that it improperly checks for block equality. This causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` in cases where the blocks have identical values but are located in different positions.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic for comparing blocks to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly recognized as unequal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Add condition to check for block equality based on both dtype and mgr_locs
    def blocks_equal(block, oblock):
        return block.dtype == oblock.dtype and block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() == oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        blocks_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a new function `blocks_equal` that checks for block equality based on both the data type (`dtype`) and the block's locations (`mgr_locs`). This ensures that blocks with identical values but different locations are correctly recognized as unequal.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return the expected boolean value based on the input parameters and satisfy the expected output values according to the GitHub issue.
