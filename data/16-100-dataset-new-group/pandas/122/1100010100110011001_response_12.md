The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test. The error message indicates that the return value is True instead of False. This is unexpected, as the function is supposed to check whether two dataframes are equal, and in this case they are not.

The potential error locations include:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` without validating their contents.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering potential differences in their elements.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when `df1` and `df2` have the same column names but in different orders. The function fails to detect this and returns True instead of False.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly compare each column of `self` and `other` to ensure that they are equal in both name and order. Additionally, when sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, it needs to account for differences in their elements that might lead to unequal dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_column_names = list(self.columns)
    other_column_names = list(other.columns)
    
    if self_column_names != other_column_names:
        return False
    
    for column in self_column_names:
        if not self[column].equals(other[column]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected function explicitly compares the column names of `self` and `other` dataframes and then iterates through each column to check if they are equal. This approach addresses the issue of different column orders in the input dataframes.
