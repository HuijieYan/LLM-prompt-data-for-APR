The buggy function has an issue with the equals() method that is used to compare two DataFrames. The bug causes the method to return True even when the two DataFrames have different values. This is a critical bug because it affects the reliability of the DataFrame comparison.

The issue occurs because the buggy function does not properly compare the blocks of the two DataFrames. It fails to take into account the possible difference in block locations due to unconsolidated blocks such as Categorical. This results in the equals() method mistakenly returning True for DataFrames with different block locations.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize() function needs to be refined to consider both the type name and the block locations when sorting the blocks. This will ensure that the block order is consistent even for unconsolidated blocks, which will lead to accurate DataFrame comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the type and the locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._typ, tuple(sorted(block.mgr_locs.sparse.difference))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the canonicalization now considers both the type name and the locations of the blocks. This ensures that unconsolidated blocks are accurately distinguished, leading to correct DataFrame comparison.

The corrected version of the function should resolve the reported issue on GitHub and pass the failing test.
