The buggy function is the equals method of the BlockManager class in the pandas library. The error message indicates that the method is returning True when it should be False. The function compares two BlockManager instances self and other to check if they are equal.

Looking at the problematic part of the code:
- The function first checks if the lengths of the self and other axes are not equal, in which case it returns False. This part does not seem to be causing the issue.
- Then, it consolidates the axes for both self and other BlockManagers using the _consolidate_inplace method. This could potentially be the cause of the issue if the consolidation process is not working correctly.
- Finally, it compares the blocks of self and other using a custom canonicalization function and returns True if all blocks are equal.

The issue might be related to the block canonicalization step, where the function first sorts the blocks using the canonicalize function and then compares the sorted blocks.


To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalization process accurately reflects the equality of the blocks. This could involve revisiting the canonicalize function and how it sorts and compares the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    # Consolidate the axes in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the canonicalized blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we compare the axes using a loop with an explicit comparison, consolidate the axes in place, and then iterate through the sorted blocks to compare them. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
