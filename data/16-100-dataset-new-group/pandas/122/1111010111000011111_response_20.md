## Explanation
The `equals` function is supposed to compare the components of two `BlockManager` objects and return True if they are equal, and False otherwise. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is asserting that the `equals` function should return False for two DataFrames with different column values. However, the current implementation of the `equals` function does not handle this case correctly and may return True when it should return False.

The bug occurs because the `equals` function compares the block components of the `BlockManager` objects without considering the data values within the blocks. It only compares the type name and the locations of the blocks. This can lead to incorrectly identifying the blocks as equal even when their actual data values are different.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare the data values of the blocks in addition to the block type name and locations. This will ensure that the comparison is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than just their metadata.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, we compare the axes of the `BlockManager` objects and then directly compare the blocks for equality by using the `equals` method of the blocks. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the actual data values within the blocks.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return the correct result for cases where the actual block data is different, as demonstrated in the failing test.
