The buggy function is a method `equals` within the `managers.py` file of the Pandas library. The function is used to compare two internal data structures for equality.

There are a few potential error locations within the function:
1. The function might be comparing the internal axes of the two data structures without first checking if they are of the same length.
2. It's possible that the function does not properly handle unconsolidated blocks, leading to inconsistencies in the comparison.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle unconsolidated blocks, leading to potential inconsistencies in the comparison.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that both data structures are properly consolidated before comparison and to handle unconsolidated blocks in a consistent manner.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I moved the consolidation of the internal data structures to the beginning of the `equals` function to ensure that they are properly consolidated before the comparison. This should address the potential bug related to unconsolidated blocks and ensure consistent behavior in the comparison.
