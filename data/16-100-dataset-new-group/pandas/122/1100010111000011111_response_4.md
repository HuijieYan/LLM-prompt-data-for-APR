The buggy function `equals` in the pandas library is not working as intended, as it does not correctly compare DataFrames and returns the wrong result.

Upon analyzing the problematic function, it seems that the bug might be associated with the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. The function tries to canonize the block order by using the `canonicalize` function and then compares each block. However, the implementation may be incorrect, leading to the erroneous return value.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is meant to verify that the `equals` method correctly identifies the inequality between two DataFrames. In this case, the expected result is `False` as the two input DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, are not equal.

To fix this bug, the canonicalization and comparison of blocks need to be revisited. An alternative approach might be to directly compare the blocks without reordering them, as the reordering might lead to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = self.axes
    other_axes = other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
      
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
            
    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the axes and blocks of the DataFrames without trying to reorder them. This should address the issue cited in the GitHub bug report, and it is expected to pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
