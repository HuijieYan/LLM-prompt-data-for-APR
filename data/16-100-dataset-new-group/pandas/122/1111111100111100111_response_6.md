To fix the bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class, we can modify the canonicalize function to return a hashable representation of the block, which will allow us to compare the blocks correctly. Additionally, we need to fix the comparison of blocks to ensure they are compared accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Modify canonicalize function to return a hashable representation
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the canonicalize function to return a tuple of block values and block locations, we make sure that we are comparing the blocks accurately. Then, in the return statement, we compare both the block values and block locations to ensure that the blocks are indeed equal.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and ensure that the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes successfully.
