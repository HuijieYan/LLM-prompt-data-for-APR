The issue with the `equals` function arises from the comparison of the `dtype` attribute of each block. The `dtype` attribute is being used as a key to sort the blocks, but the `dtype` attribute comparison does not take into account the actual contents of the DataFrame, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the actual content of the blocks in addition to the `dtype` attribute. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            # Include block data and dtype in the canonicalization
            return (block._get_values().tobytes(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By including the block data in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations will be correctly identified as unequal, fixing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
