The buggy function seems to be comparing two BlockManager objects based on their axes and blocks. It's using the `equals` method to compare the axes and blocks of the two BlockManager objects.

However, the issue seems to be with the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. It's comparing the two tuples directly, which may not be the correct way to compare the blocks.

Therefore, the fix for the bug could involve iterating through each block in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, and comparing each pair of blocks using their `equals` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version compares each pair of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using their `equals` method, ultimately returning `True` if all blocks are equal and `False` if any pair of blocks is not equal.
