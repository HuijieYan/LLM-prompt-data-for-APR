The bug in the `equals` function is causing the assertion error to fail. The function is incorrectly returning True when it should be returning False due to the input DataFrames having identical blocks with different locations.

The bug occurs because the `equals` function attempts to compare the blocks of the two DataFrames, but it does not handle the case where identical blocks have different locations. This results in the function incorrectly returning True when it should actually be False.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to account for identical blocks with different locations when comparing two DataFrames. This can be achieved by updating the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations in addition to block dtype, and then using this updated canonicalize function to correctly compare the blocks of the two DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # updated canonicalize function to consider block locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This updated version of the `equals` function should now correctly handle the case where identical blocks have different locations, and it should pass the failing test while also resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
