The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `equals` doesn't correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances. It seems to be incorrectly comparing the blocks and axes of the two `BlockManager` instances, leading to a failure when the function is called with DataFrame inputs.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `equals` function correctly compares the `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes and the blocks they contain.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks before comparison
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda block: (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted))
```

This corrected version of the function properly compares the axes and blocks of the `BlockManager` instances. It sorts the blocks before comparing them to ensure that they are in the correct order for comparison.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
