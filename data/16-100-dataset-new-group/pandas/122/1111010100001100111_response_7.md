The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to how it compares the blocks of the `self` and `other` BlockManager objects. It fails to properly compare the blocks, resulting in incorrect return values.

The issue on GitHub provides a simple code sample showing that `df3.equals(df4)` incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False`.

The bug is likely caused by the comparison of block items without considering their actual content or location, leading to incorrect equality checks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers both the type and location of the blocks. Additionally, we should ensure that the comparison handles mixed-type data correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._block_type, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are using `block._block_type` and `str(block.mgr_locs)` to create a canonical representation of each block, which will be used for comparison. This approach ensures that the comparison considers both the type and location of the blocks, leading to correct equality checks.
