The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return True instead of False when comparing two DataFrames. The cause of the bug is likely the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames, where the order and type of the blocks are not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks in the two DataFrames are compared properly. We can do this by sorting the blocks based on their type and locations to ensure correct comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should resolve the issue of returning True instead of False when comparing two DataFrames. It ensures that the blocks within the DataFrames are sorted and compared based on their type and locations.

With this correction, the failing test case should pass, and the expected input/output values should be satisfied. Additionally, this correction should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
