The bug in the provided function `equals` is causing the assertion error in the failing test, as evidenced by the error message:

```
E       assert True is False
```

The issue seems to be related to the comparison between `df1` and `df2` DataFrames. The `equals` function is not correctly comparing the two DataFrames, leading to an incorrect assertion.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the DataFrames is done correctly, taking into account the structure and data within the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.items()
    other_blocks = other.items()
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks  # Directly compare the blocks
```

In this corrected version, we compare the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` directly to check for equality. This should provide the correct comparison between the DataFrames and pass the failing test.
