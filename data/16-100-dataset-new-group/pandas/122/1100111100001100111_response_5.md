The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return `True` in cases where it should return `False`, as reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The issue states that when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, it incorrectly returns `True` for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, when the expected behavior is to return `False`.

The buggy function `equals` compares the axes of two BlockManager objects and their corresponding blocks. The issue arises when the function fails to account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the contents and locations of the blocks separately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = {block.mgr_locs: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {block.mgr_locs: block for block in other.blocks}
    
    if self_blocks.keys() != other_blocks.keys():
        return False
    
    for loc in self_blocks:
        if loc not in other_blocks or not self_blocks[loc].equals(other_blocks[loc]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In the corrected version, we first compare the axes of the BlockManager objects. Then, we consolidate both BlockManagers to ensure consistent block locations. After that, we compare the blocks by their locations, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified. If any of the checks fail, the function returns `False`. If all comparisons pass, the function returns `True`.

This corrected version of the `equals` function addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should now return the expected results for the failing test cases.
