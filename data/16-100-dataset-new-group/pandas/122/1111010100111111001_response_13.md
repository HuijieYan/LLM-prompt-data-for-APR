The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test to fail. The function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The bug occurs when comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to determine if each block within the BlockManager is equal.

One potential cause of the bug is the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting may not order the blocks correctly, leading to a miscomparison.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to ensure that the sorting of blocks is done based on a unique identifier that guarantees the correct order. Additionally, the comparison of individual blocks should be done in a way that ensures their equality is accurately assessed.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Ensure correct ordering of blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: id(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: id(block))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the unique identifier of each block to guarantee the correct order for comparison. Additionally, the comparison of individual blocks is performed accurately to check for equality.
