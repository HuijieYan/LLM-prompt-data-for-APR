## Corrections:

### Analysis:
- The `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` with the provided input `df1` and `df2` should return `False` as they are not equal due to the data type mismatch in the columns.
- The issue in the GitHub clearly states that the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations, which aligns with the failing test.

### Bugs:
- The function incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks are not equal due to a data type mismatch.

### Correction strategy:
- The `equals` function should be modified to properly compare the blocks based on their data and locations.

### Corrected function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```
