To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used within the `equals` method, so that it considers both the data type and the location of the blocks. This will allow the function to correctly identify identical blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.values)
    # convert block.values to string to include the location information as well

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The current `canonicalize` function groups blocks only based on data type, which results in identical blocks with different locations being considered the same. By modifying the function to include the location information as well, it will correctly differentiate between identical blocks with different locations.

With this modification, the `equals` method should now correctly identify identical blocks with different locations, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
