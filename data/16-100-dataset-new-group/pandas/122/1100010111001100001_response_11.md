There is a bug in the `equals` function that is causing it to fail for the given test case. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The bug is likely occurring in the portion of the code where the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are being sorted and compared.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. Issues with comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method.
2. Problems with the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function.

The bug is likely being caused by the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method, as well as the sorting of the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function. The comparison is failing due to an incorrect order of the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, which causes the `equals` comparison to return `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly, as well as identifying the issue with the comparison using the `equals` method.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are sorting the blocks based on a combination of the block's `dtype` and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, we are comparing the block values using the `equals` method, ensuring correct comparison of the block values rather than the blocks themselves. This change should address the issue with the failing test case and fix the bug in the `equals` function.
