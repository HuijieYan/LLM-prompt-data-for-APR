Based on the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be that the `equals` function is returning True instead of False when comparing dataframes `df3.equals(df4)`. This occurs due to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, which the function incorrectly identifies as being the same.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparisons between blocks and the sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize()` method.

To fix the bug, a possible strategy would be to modify the `canonicalize()` method so that it distinguishes between blocks with different locations. Another approach could be to implement a different comparison method for the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function, taking into account the expected input/output values and addressing the issue from GitHub:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, hash(tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the hash of the block's locations, ensuring that blocks with different locations are not incorrectly identified as equal. This should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.
