The bug in the `equals` function is causing the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is resulting in `assert True is False` which means the `df1.equals(df2)` is evaluating to `True` instead of `False`. This means that the `equals` function is not correctly identifying that `df1` and `df2` are not equal.

The bug appears to be related to how the `equals` function is comparing the two dataframes and potentially how it is sorting and comparing the blocks within the dataframes.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified so that it correctly identifies when two dataframes are not equal. The comparison and sorting logic for the blocks within the dataframes may need to be adjusted to ensure that the function accurately determines the equality of the dataframes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I modified the `canonicalize` function to convert the block's dtype to a string with `str(block.dtype)` and called `block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. I also added a check to ensure that the number of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are equal before comparing each block. These adjustments should address the bug and make the function correctly determine the equality of the dataframes.
