The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class fails to properly compare two block managers for equality. The issue arises when the blocks are identical, but their locations are different, resulting in the function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`. This has led to a reported bug on GitHub with the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The potential error location can be identified in the `equals` function where the code focuses on comparing the blocks between the two managers without accounting for block locations.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be modified to compare both the blocks and their locations. This can be achieved by incorporating additional logic to consider the unique IDs or other identifiers of the blocks when performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block types and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__, block._block_locs.as_tuple())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is used to generate a unique identifier for each block based on its type and location. Then, the blocks are sorted based on this identifier, and the comparison considers both block equality and their respective locations.

This corrected version addresses the GitHub issue and ensures that the `equals` function behaves as expected, effectively comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on both their blocks and block locations.
