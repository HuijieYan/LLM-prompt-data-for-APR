The bug in the `equals` function is causing the failing test. The bug seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables. It is likely that the sorting is not being performed correctly, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we should make sure that the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables is performed correctly before the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
