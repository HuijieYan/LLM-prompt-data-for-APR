The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` when it should return `False` in a specific scenario. This scenario occurs when there are identical blocks with different locations. This is due to the `canonicalize` function that sorts the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists using the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs` as criteria. However, when the blocks have the same content but different locations, the `canonicalize` function does not account for this, causing the incorrect comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the content of the blocks in its criteria, in addition to `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs`. This will differentiate between blocks with the same content but different locations and ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using type name, mgr_locs, and content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.values  # include block content in criteria
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the block content when sorting the blocks, ensuring that blocks with the same content but different locations are differentiated. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
