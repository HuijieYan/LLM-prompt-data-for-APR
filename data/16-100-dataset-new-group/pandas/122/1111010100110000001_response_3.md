The buggy function `equals` has issues with comparing the values in `df1` and `df2` and returning the incorrect result. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects and checks if they are equal. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` even though it should be `False`.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function could be in the comparison and sorting of blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic in the `equals` function is not correctly identifying differences between the `BlockManager` objects. This is resulting in the function incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison and sorting of blocks are done correctly, so that the `equals` function accurately determines whether the two `BlockManager` objects are equal.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the `canonicalize` function to convert the block dtype to a string, and used the `mgr_locs.as_array.tostring()` method to uniquely identify block locations. Additionally, when comparing `dtype`, we use the `str` function to ensure a consistent comparison regardless of the dtype class. This should ensure that the comparison in the `equals` function is accurate, and the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
