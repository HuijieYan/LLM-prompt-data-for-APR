The bug in the provided function is likely to be in the `canonicalize` function and the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is due to a failure in the comparison between the two DataFrames.

The `canonicalize` function is not handling the values of the different blocks correctly, which leads to the incorrect comparison and sorting. Therefore, the bug is likely in the `canonicalize` function.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to accurately represent the blocks. Additionally, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` needs to be fixed to correctly compare the blocks in the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Combine type name and mgr_locs to represent the block uniquely
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Verify equality of sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these corrections, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
