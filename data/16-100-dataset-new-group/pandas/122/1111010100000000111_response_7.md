## Analysis

The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class seems to be incorrectly comparing the block data. The reported GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

## Identifying potential error locations

1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` could be incorrect.
2. Sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function may not produce the expected ordering for comparison.

## Cause of the bug

The bug is caused by incorrect comparison of the block data in the equals function. When comparing data blocks with different locations, the function incorrectly returns True, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Modify the comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` to ensure it considers the shapes of the blocks with different locations.
2. Adjust the block sorting mechanism to correctly compare and identify identical blocks with different locations.

## Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    # Compare the shapes of the blocks to handle different locations
    if any(s_ax.shape != o_ax.shape for s_ax, o_ax in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of block shapes has been added to handle blocks with different locations. This ensures that the function correctly compares the blocks and returns the expected output.
