The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing two DataFrames. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is expecting the output of `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`, but the function returns `True` instead.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the comparison of the two DataFrames. It compares the axes, consolidates inplace, and then compares the blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed and does not properly account for the contents of the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be revised to properly compare the contents of the DataFrames. This can be achieved by iterating over the elements of the DataFrames and performing a direct comparison of each element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False
    
    for col in self.columns:
        if not (self[col] == other[col]).all().all():
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the shapes of the DataFrames are the same. If they are not, we return `False`. Then, we iterate over each column and compare the values using the `==` operator, and then use the `all()` method to check if all comparisons are `True`.

This revised logic will correctly compare the contents of the DataFrames and return the expected result in the failing test.
