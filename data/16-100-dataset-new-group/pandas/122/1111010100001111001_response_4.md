The buggy function "equals" compares the block structure and content of two BlockManager instances for equality. However, there is an issue with how it is handling the comparison of "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" in the last section of the function. The comparison of the blocks appears to be incorrect, which is likely causing the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly to reflect the expected input/output values. Specifically, we should compare the properties of the blocks, including their data, dtype, and placement, to determine if they are equal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.get_values().equals(oblock.get_values()) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) and block.dtype == oblock.dtype for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of blocks is done by comparing the values, mgr_locs, and dtype to ensure that the blocks are equal. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected results for the given input.
