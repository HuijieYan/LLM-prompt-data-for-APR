## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The comparison `if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):` may not be handling the comparison of axes correctly.
2. The sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function and subsequent comparison may not be accurately reflecting the equality of the blocks.

## Cause of the bug
The bug appears to stem from how the `equals` function compares the axes and blocks of two dataframe objects. The failing test case illustrates that the expected return value is `False` but the actual return value is `True`. This indicates that the comparison logic within the `equals` function is not functioning as intended, resulting in an incorrect result.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be updated to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks between two dataframes is performed correctly. This may involve modifying the comparison logic and the sorting of blocks to accurately reflect the equality of the dataframes.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._astype(str), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._astype(str), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the sorting of blocks is done using a lambda function that takes into account the type and locations of the blocks to ensure proper comparison. This should address the issue and make the `equals` function return the expected results for the failing test case.
