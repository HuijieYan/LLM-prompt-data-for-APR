The issue in the buggy function is likely caused by the comparison between two dataframes using the `equals` method. It seems that the problem arises when the dataframes have the same columns but the data within those columns are not in the same order. This can cause the `equals` method to return `True` when it should actually return `False`.

To fix this, we need to reorder the columns of the dataframes and then perform the comparison. It's likely that the comparison between the blocks is returning `True` in some cases where the order of the blocks doesn't match.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other methods
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Create a function to get the column order of each dataframe
        def get_column_order(df):
            return tuple(df.columns)

        # Reorder the columns of the dataframes
        self_columns_order = get_column_order(self)
        other_columns_order = get_column_order(other)
        self_reordered = self[self_columns_order]
        other_reordered = other[other_columns_order]

        # Check for equality after reordering
        return self_reordered.equals(other_reordered)
```

This corrected version rearranges the columns of the dataframes inside the `equals` function before making the comparison. This will ensure that the comparison takes into account the order of the columns and should prevent the issue seen in the failing test.
