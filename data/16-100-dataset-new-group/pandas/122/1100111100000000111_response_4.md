The bug in the `equals` function causes it to wrongly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue. The issue description provides a code sample and the expected output, but the current implementation of the `equals` function does not produce the expected output. 

The issue is located in the `equals` function, where the `canonicalize` function is called to canonically order the blocks before comparing them. However, the `canonicalize` function is also defined within the `equals` function, which causes confusion and may lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be moved out of the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function should be defined as a separate function, outside of any other functions, within the same class.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# Define the canonicalize function outside of the equals function
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

# Update the equals function to use the canonicalize function properly
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By moving the `canonicalize` function out of the `equals` function and defining it at the class level, we ensure that it is properly accessible and callable within the `equals` function, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
