The bug in the given function is that the `equals` method is incorrectly comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. 

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function returns a tuple that combines the type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute for each block. However, it is not implemented correctly. Additionally, the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `canonicalize` function returns a tuple that accurately represents the type and location of each block. Then, we can sort the blocks based on this tuple and compare them one by one.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Correct the canonicalize function to return a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass.
