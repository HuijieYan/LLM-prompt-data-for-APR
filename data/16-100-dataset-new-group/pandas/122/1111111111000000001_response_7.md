The bug in the `equals` function is that it is not comparing the DataFrame objects correctly. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks in the DataFrames based on their type and manager locations, but the comparison is not taking into account the actual data in the blocks.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks needs to be done based on the actual data they contain, not just their types and manager locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare data in the blocks
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the DataFrames based on the actual data in the blocks, and it should pass the failing test.
