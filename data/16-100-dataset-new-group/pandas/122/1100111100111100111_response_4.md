The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to erroneously return `True` instead of `False` for two DataFrames that are not equal. This is likely due to a problem with the comparison of the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the comparison of `mgr_locs` takes into account the order of the blocks. This means that we need to update the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple that combines the dtype name and the mgr_locs in a way that reflects the block order.

The corrected version of the `equals` function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we update the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple `(block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))` which combines the dtype name and the mgr_locs in a way that reflects the block order. By doing this, we can ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly, accounting for possible unconsolidated blocks that can only be distinguished by the iteration order.

After making this change, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the DataFrames and return `False` when they are not equal, as expected. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and make the failing test pass.
