The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class within the pandas library. It is designed to compare the internal data of two dataframes for equality.

The specific error occurs when trying to compare two dataframes `df1` and `df2`, and the function should return `False` because the dataframes are not equal. However, the function returns `True` instead, which causes the assertion error.

The buggy function compares the shapes and axes of the two block managers but fails to compare the actual data blocks.

A strategy to fix the bug is to modify the comparison logic to include comparison of the actual data blocks within each block manager.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected function, the comparison now includes sorting and comparing the actual data blocks within each block manager.

This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result when comparing the two dataframes `df1` and `df2`.
