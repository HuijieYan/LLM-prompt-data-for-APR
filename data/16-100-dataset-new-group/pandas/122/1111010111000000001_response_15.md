The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison between the lengths of self_axes and other_axes.
2. The comparison between the lengths of self.blocks and other.blocks.
3. The sorting and comparison of self_blocks and other_blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function "equals" in the BlockManager class is not able to properly compare the two DataFrames, resulting in the failing test test_dataframe_not_equal. The comparison logic in the equals function is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the equals function needs to be revised to ensure that the two BlockManagers or DataFrames are appropriately compared.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the axes
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self.axes)):
        if not self.axes[i].equals(other.axes[i]):
            return False
    
    # Consolidate inplace
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare the blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._get_values().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
            
    return True
```

With this corrected version of the equals function, it should now pass the failing test test_dataframe_not_equal.
