Based on the provided runtime input/output values, the bug likely lies in the `canonicalize` function which is used to sort `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. This is causing the equality check to fail when it shouldn't.

The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple combination of the block's type name and `mgr_locs`, but it's not clear what `mgr_locs` is and how it should be used in this context. This is likely the cause of the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is done in a way that accurately captures their content and allows for a correct equality check.

Here's an updated version of the `equals` function with the potential bug fixed:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this updated version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the block's class name and its values for sorting. This ensures that blocks with different values are correctly recognized as not equal, leading to a more accurate equality check.
