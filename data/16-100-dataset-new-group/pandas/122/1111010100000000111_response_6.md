Based on the GitHub issue and the provided function, it seems that the issue is related to the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class in pandas. The problem occurs when the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are in the comparison of blocks and the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks.

The bug is likely caused by the comparison of blocks using `equals` and the sorting of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists based on their type name and `mgr_locs`. This leads to `equals` wrongly returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to compare blocks based on their actual content rather than just their type name and locations. Additionally, the sorting of blocks should be based on their content rather than their type name and locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize and then compare blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```
In the corrected version, I have applied the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their actual content, using the `values` attribute of the blocks. Then, I compare the sorted blocks using `np.array_equal` to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified.
