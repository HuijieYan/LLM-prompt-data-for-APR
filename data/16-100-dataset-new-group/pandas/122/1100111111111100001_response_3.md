The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting is done using the `canonicalize` function, which applies the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to each block. However, the `block` variable used in the `canonicalize` definition is not obtained within the `canonicalize` function, resulting in a NameError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `block` variable is accessible within the `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test case should now pass.
