### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It first checks if the axes of both instances are equal, then consolidates the instances in place, sorts the blocks, and then compares each block for equality. The failing test is comparing two dataframes to check if they are not equal, but it is receiving a `True` instead of `False`.

### Error Locations
1. The comparison of axes.
2. The consolidation of the instances in place.
3. Sorting and comparison of blocks.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect sorting and comparison of blocks, leading to a `True` being returned instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the comparison of axes to ensure that it correctly identifies if they are different.
2. Identify any potential issues in the consolidation process and fix them.
3. Address the sorting and comparison of blocks to ensure that they are correctly compared for equality.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if any(not ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
