The bug in the `equals` function is identified as returning True when comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect behavior and failed test cases. This issue has been raised on GitHub and identified by a user running pandas version 0.25.0.

The cause of the bug is due to the function's failure to correctly compare the blocks based on their dtype and manager locations. The sorting logic of the self and other blocks needs to be adjusted to ensure consistent order for effective comparison.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization logic for blocks should be revised to ensure consistent and correct comparisons.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function will consistently sort and compare the blocks based on their type, dtype name, and mgr_locs, ensuring the expected behavior and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
