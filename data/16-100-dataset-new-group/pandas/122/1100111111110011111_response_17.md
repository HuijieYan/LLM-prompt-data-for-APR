The bug in the `equals` function is causing incorrect results, as indicated by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The issue is related to identical blocks with different locations incorrectly returning `True`. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not be indicating the correct equality.
2. The sorting and comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` may not be considering the block locations correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not handling block locations properly, leading to incorrect comparisons between DataFrames. This results in an incorrect `True` value when the expected result should be `False`.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `equals` function to consider block locations and ensure that the comparison occurs correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, hash(block.values.tobytes()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version handles block locations properly by using the hash of the block values for canonicalization. This should ensure that the function correctly identifies the differences between DataFrames.

After implementing this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is expected to pass, and the `equals` function should provide the correct comparison results.
