## Fixing the bug

### Issue analysis
The buggy function `equals` wrongly returns True for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug location
The bug occurs in the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug cause
The bug is caused by the comparison not properly addressing the identical blocks with different locations.

### Fix strategy
We need to modify the comparison logic in the buggy function to properly handle identical blocks with different locations.

### Corrected code for the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Sort the blocks prior to comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.index))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values, block.index))
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks prior to comparison using the `sorted` function and lambdas for the key, we ensure that the identical blocks with different locations are compared correctly.

Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
