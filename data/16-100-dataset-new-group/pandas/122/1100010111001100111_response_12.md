The bug in the `equals` function arises from the fact that it compares the data blocks in a sorted order, which results in `df1.equals(df2)` returning `True` even when the dataframes `df1` and `df2` are not actually equal.

To fix the bug, we need to maintain the original order of the blocks in the dataframe before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks with preserving the original order
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly identify whether the two dataframes are equal based on the order of their blocks. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub and also ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes as expected.
