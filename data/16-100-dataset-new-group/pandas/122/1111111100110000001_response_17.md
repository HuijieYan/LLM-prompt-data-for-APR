The buggy function `equals` is comparing two dataframes `self` and `other` and it is expected to return False if they are not equal. The error message is indicating that the comparison between the two dataframes is resulting in True instead of False.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison logic in the function could be incorrect.
2. The call to the `_consolidate_inplace` function before comparing the blocks might cause issues.

The cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be in the comparison logic of the equals function. It is possible that the dataframes `self` and `other` are not being correctly compared or the sorting and comparison of the blocks are not being handled properly.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Verify that the comparison logic of the equals function is correct and handles all edge cases. 
2. Ensure that the call to `_consolidate_inplace` does not introduce unexpected side effects.
3. Check the sorting and comparison of blocks to ensure it accurately determines if the dataframes are equal or not.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the axes
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate inplace
    self_consolidated = self.copy()
    self_consolidated._consolidate_inplace()
    other_consolidated = other.copy()
    other_consolidated._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self_consolidated.blocks) != len(other_consolidated.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_consolidated.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_consolidated.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected version, this function should pass the failing test.
