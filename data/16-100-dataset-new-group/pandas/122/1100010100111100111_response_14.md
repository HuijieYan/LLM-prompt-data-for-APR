The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the buggy function is returning `False` when it should return `True` because it is comparing the blocks in the wrong order and using the wrong logic to compare the values.

The issue arises from the fact that the function is sorting the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. When comparing different DataFrames, this sorting can lead to unexpected results, as the blocks may be in different orders due to differences in their dtype names and manager locations.

A potential fix for this bug is to modify the comparison logic to compare blocks based on their positions within the axes, rather than relying on the sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This will ensure that the comparison is based on the actual structure of the blocks rather than their ordering due to sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test, ensuring that the comparison of blocks is based on their actual contents rather than their ordering due to sorting.
