The bug in the provided `equals` function is that it does not correctly handle the comparison of two BlockManager objects, leading to incorrect results.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly compare the blocks within the BlockManager, leading to an incorrect comparison result. This is due to the sorting of blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function, which is not taking into account the actual content of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic of the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks within the BlockManager objects, rather than just comparing the sorted lists of blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This new version of the function iterates over the blocks of both BlockManager objects and compares each block individually. This ensures that the comparison is done at the block level, rather than relying on the sorting of blocks alone. This should fix the bug and make the function correctly compare the two BlockManager objects.

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass.
