## Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is used to determine if two DataFrames are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provides two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different column data types and values, so it expects the `equals` method to return `False`.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the comparison of blocks using `.equals()` method without consolidating the blocks. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with unconsolidated blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are comparing consolidated blocks of the DataFrames. This can be achieved by calling the `_consolidate()` method on each block before comparing them.

The corrected version of the function includes calling `_consolidate()` method on blocks before comparison to ensure that the comparison is done on consolidated blocks, which resolves the bug and allows the function to pass the failing test.
