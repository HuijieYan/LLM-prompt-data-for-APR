The bug in the equals function is causing the failing test to return an AssertionError. The bug is likely related to the incorrect comparison of DataFrame objects.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to compare the values of the DataFrames directly instead of using the .equals() method, which seems to be causing the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.get_blocks_values()
    other_blocks = other.get_blocks_values()
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected version compares the block values directly and should resolve the issue with the failing test.
