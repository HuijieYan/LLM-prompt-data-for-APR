The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of block objects within the `BlockManager` class. The method tries to compare the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances, but it's not handling the comparison correctly. Specifically, it seems that the sorting of the blocks is not effective, leading to false negatives when comparing blocks.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be to improve the sorting and comparison of the blocks. It could involve using a more robust method to canonicalize and compare the blocks, ensuring a correct comparison of the block elements.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # improve sorting and comparison of blocks
    self_blocks = {canonicalize(block) for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {canonicalize(block) for block in other.blocks}
    return self_blocks == other_blocks

# helper function for canonicalizing blocks
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function is used to create a deterministic representation of block elements within the `BlockManager`. This representation is then used to compare the blocks between the two instances.

By implementing the suggested strategy and using the corrected version provided above, the `equals` function should correctly compare the `BlockManager` instances as expected, passing the failing test.
