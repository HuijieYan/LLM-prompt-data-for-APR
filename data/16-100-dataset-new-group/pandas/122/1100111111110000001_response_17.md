The buggy function `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class is attempting to compare two dataframes using the `.equals()` method. However, the comparison fails due to a mismatch in the order of the columns in the dataframes.

The primary issue in the buggy function arises when attempting to compare the dataframes. The function `canonicalize` is defined twice, once outside the class and once inside the class. This can cause confusion and potentially lead to incorrect behavior when the function is called.

To fix the bug, the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function should be removed, and the logic for canonicalizing the blocks should be updated to handle the ordering of the columns properly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other functions...
    
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return tuple(
                (block.iloc[:, col].dtype, block.columns[col]) for col in range(block.shape[1])
            )
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now creates a tuple of column data types and names for each block, to ensure that the comparison takes into account the column order as well. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
