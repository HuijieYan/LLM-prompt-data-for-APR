The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test. The `equals` function is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances, and then sorts and compares the blocks. The bug is likely in the block comparison part of the function, as indicated by the error message from the failing test, which shows that the comparison of `df1.equals(df2)` evaluates to `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the implementation of the block comparison within the `equals` function. Since the `df1.equals(df2)` evaluation resulted in `True` instead of the expected `False`, we can assume that the comparison logic is not working as intended. This could be due to issues in the sorting or comparison of the blocks in the function.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to carefully review the block comparison logic within the `equals` function. The sorting and comparison process should be examined to ensure that it correctly identifies differences between blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances. Additionally, it's important to compare the blocks in a way that adheres to the expected behavior for equality of `BlockManager` instances.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._get_dtype(), hash(block)))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._get_dtype(), hash(block)))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should appropriately compare the `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test.
