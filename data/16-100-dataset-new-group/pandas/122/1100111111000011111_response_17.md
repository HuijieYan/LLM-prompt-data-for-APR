## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Create a function to canonicalize blocks and their locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), str(block.mgr_locs.as_array))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation and strategy for fixing the bug:
- The issue seems to be related to the wrong result returned by the `equals` function when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
- The bug can be fixed by creating a new `canonicalize` function that includes the values and locations of the blocks in the comparison.
- The function `canonicalize` now converts the block values and their locations to strings and returns a tuple of these strings.
- The corrected version of the function uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks before comparison.

This approach ensures that the comparison considers the values and locations of blocks, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
