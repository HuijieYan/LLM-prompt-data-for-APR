The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `equals` method of each block.

The `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are stored as a tuple of blocks, and when comparing them, the code accurately sorts the blocks and then uses the `equals` method to check if each block is equal to the corresponding block in the other. However, the bug arises when comparing the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block within the `canonicalize` function, as the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed from the `block`, which is a class object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly. We should directly access the `mgr_locs` attribute from the block when creating the canonicalized representation.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function directly accesses the `mgr_locs` attribute from the `block` and creates the canonicalized representation. This ensures that the comparison of blocks considers the correct `mgr_locs` attribute and fixes the bug in the `equals` function.
