The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing blocks. The buggy function does not correctly compare the blocks when determining equality between DataFrames, leading to incorrect output. The `equals` method should compare corresponding blocks in two DataFrames, but it was not comparing them correctly. 

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be updated to compare the blocks based on their contents.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    for block in self.blocks:
        if block not in other.blocks:
            return False
    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` method will correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames for equality.

This corrected version is expected to satisfy the failing test and the GitHub issue by properly returning `False` when comparing the example DataFrames provided in the test, as well as fixing the bug reported on GitHub.
