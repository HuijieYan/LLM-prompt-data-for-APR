The bug in the `equals` function appears to be related to the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The issue might be that the sorting order might not be consistent with the equality comparison. Additionally, there might be an issue with the `block.equals(oblock)` comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the sorting order is consistent and that the comparison between blocks is correctly implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize_key(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block._block_type)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_key)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using a key function in the `sorted` calls, the blocks will be sorted consistently. Additionally, the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method should now produce the correct results.
