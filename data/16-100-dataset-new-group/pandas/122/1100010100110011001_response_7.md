The bug in the equals function appears to be related to the comparison of two dataframes using the equals method. The test case is expecting the comparison of two dataframes (df1 and df2) with different values to return False, but it is returning True instead.

The buggy function seems to be trying to compare the axes and blocks of two dataframes, but it is not properly handling the comparison of values within the blocks.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison of blocks within the dataframes to properly handle the comparison of different values.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
This correction should address the issue with the failing test case and ensure that the comparison of dataframes returns the expected values.
