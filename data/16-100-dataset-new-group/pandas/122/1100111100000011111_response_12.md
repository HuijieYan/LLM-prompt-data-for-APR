## Code analysis and bug explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It starts by comparing the axes of the two objects, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares their blocks. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which suggests a problem with the comparison of block locations.

## Bug location and cause:
The buggy function has a nested function `canonicalize` that sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This sorting operation was intended to ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations would be considered equal. However, there is a bug in the function `canonicalize` that causes it to return the manager locations as a list, rather than the expected `BlockPlacement` object. This causes the sorting to fail, leading to incorrect comparisons of the blocks.

## Bug fix:
To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be corrected so that it properly returns the `BlockPlacement` object as the manager locations. Additionally, the sorting logic needs to be adjusted to handle the `BlockPlacement` objects properly.

## Corrected code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # corrected canonicalize function to return BlockPlacement object
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the correction to the `canonicalize` function and the sorting logic, the function should now properly handle blocks with identical data but different locations, resolving the reported issue on GitHub.
