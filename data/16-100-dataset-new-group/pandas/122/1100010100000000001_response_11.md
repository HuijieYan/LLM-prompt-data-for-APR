## Analysis
The buggy function is a method of a class, and it is intended to compare two instances of the class for equality. It first compares the axes of the two instances, then consolidates the instances, and finally compares the blocks within the instances. 

## Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison of axes might not be accurate.
2. The consolidation of the instances could have unintended side effects.
3. The comparison of blocks might not be correct.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug could be caused by incorrect comparison of the axes, unintended side effects of consolidation, or incorrect comparison of blocks. 

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Verify the comparison of axes for accuracy
2. Ensure that consolidation is done without unintended side effects
3. Validate the comparison of blocks for correctness

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    # compare the axes
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    # create consolidated copies for comparison
    self_copy = self.copy()
    other_copy = other.copy()
    self_copy._consolidate_inplace()
    other_copy._consolidate_inplace()

    # compare the consolidated blocks
    if len(self_copy.blocks) != len(other_copy.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_copy.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_copy.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we create consolidated copies of the instances for comparison to avoid unintended side effects. We also compare the axes and blocks more accurately.
