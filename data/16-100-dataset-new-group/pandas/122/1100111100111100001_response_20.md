The error in the buggy function is due to the incorrect comparison of two DataFrames in the `equals` method. The failure of the test case indicates that the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are incorrectly considered equal when they are not, leading to an assertion error.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. In the `canonicalize` function, which may not be giving the expected result when sorting the blocks.
2. In the comparison of the sorted self_blocks and other_blocks using the `equals` method.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method of a DataFrame is not correctly comparing the two DataFrames, leading to a false positive result when they are not actually equal. This likely originates from an issue in the `canonicalize` function or the sorting of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to correctly represent the blocks. Additionally, the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should be updated to ensure that the DataFrames are accurately compared.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.iloc[0].start))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.iloc[0].start))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
The key changes made include:
1. Adjusting the `canonicalize` function to properly sort the blocks based on dtype name and the start of mgr_locs.
2. Using `iloc[0].start` to select the start of mgr_locs when sorting the blocks.
3. Comparing the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method to accurately determine if the DataFrames are equal.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test.
