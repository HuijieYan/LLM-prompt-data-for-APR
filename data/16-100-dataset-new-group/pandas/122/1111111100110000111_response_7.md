The bug in the buggy function is causing the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to return incorrect results when comparing two DataFrames. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the logic for comparing the blocks of data and in the implementation of the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks for comparison.

The cause of the bug is related to how the `equals` method sorts and compares the blocks of data within the DataFrames. It seems that the function is incorrectly returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the logic within the `equals` method to correctly compare the blocks, ensuring that the comparison takes block locations into account and returns the expected boolean value.

Here's the corrected version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, hash(block.values.tostring()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the updated version, the `canonicalize` function now hashes the block values to ensure that the comparison takes into account the block locations. This change should address the incorrect behavior and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
