The bug in the `equals` function is causing the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` test case to fail. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" describes the problem as the `equals` method returning `True` incorrectly.

The buggy function is not properly comparing the two DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2`. This is causing the `assert` statement in the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should compare the two DataFrames based on their content, rather than based on their memory location or other internal factors. Additionally, the comparison should consider the order of the data within the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    return self.reset_index(drop=True).equals(other.reset_index(drop=True))
```

By resetting the index and dropping it, the comparison will only consider the content of the DataFrames without taking into account their memory location or other internal factors.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should address the bug and make the failing test case pass.
