The issue with the `equals` function is that it is not handling the comparison between the different dataframes correctly due to the fact that it is not accounting for the different data types in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The buggy code uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, however, this method does not account for the different data types in the blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to take into consideration the data type of the block. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction will correctly account for the different data types in the blocks and ensure that the comparison between dataframes is done accurately.

Please keep in mind to test the corrected function with the given failing test case to ensure the bug is fixed.
