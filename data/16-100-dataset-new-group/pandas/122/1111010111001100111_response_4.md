Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue with the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is that it returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations. The issue is related to the ordering and comparison of the blocks.

The problematic code is in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises from the comparison of the blocks without considering their locations, leading to incorrect equality checks.

To fix this issue, a strategy would be to modify the `equals` method to consider both the type and the location of the blocks when comparing them. This can be achieved by sorting and comparing the blocks based on a combination of block type and location.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a combination of type and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a combination of their type and location, the corrected method ensures that blocks with different locations will not be incorrectly considered equal. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` method behaves as expected.

With this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly return `False` for the failing test case provided.
