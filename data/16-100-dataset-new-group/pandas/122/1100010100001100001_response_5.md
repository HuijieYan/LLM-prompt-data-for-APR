The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. However, the function fails to return the correct result due to a potential issue with sorting and comparing the blocks.

Looking at the provided runtime input/output values and types, we can see that the self and other BlockManagers have the same axes, but their blocks are in different orders. Therefore, sorting the blocks before comparison is a valid approach, but the sorting implementation within the `canonicalize` function might not be working as intended.

To fix the bug, we can update the `canonicalize` function to include the block's data as well. This way, when sorting the blocks, the data within the blocks will also be considered during comparison, ensuring a more accurate result.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type, data, and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block's values when creating the tuple for comparison. This change will ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared accurately, taking into account the data within the blocks.

With this fix, the function should now provide the correct comparison results for the given input values and types.
