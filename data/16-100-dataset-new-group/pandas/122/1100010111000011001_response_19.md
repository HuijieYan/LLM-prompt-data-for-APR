The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` due to the incorrect comparison of the values in the dataframes.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the values in the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` rather than sorting and comparing the blocks. We can use the `equals` function of the Pandas DataFrame directly to perform this comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    return self.equals(other)
```

With this corrected version, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass as the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are compared directly using the `equals` function. This ensures that the values in the DataFrames are correctly compared to determine if they are equal.
