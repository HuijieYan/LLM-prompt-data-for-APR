## The corrected version of the function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is due to the incorrect way of identifying and comparing the blocks. In the corrected version, I have made the following changes:
1. Replaced `block.dtype.name` with `block.__class__.__name__` to properly identify the type of the block. This ensures that even unconsolidated blocks can be distinguished.
2. Changed the canonicalize function to return a tuple consisting of the block's class name and the mgr_locs converted to a list using `as_array.tolist()`, which provides a consistent representation of the block for comparison.
3. Sorted both self_blocks and other_blocks based on the updated canonicalize function to ensure a consistent comparison.
4. Used `block.equals(oblock)` to compare each block in self_blocks with the corresponding block in other_blocks.

With these changes, the corrected function should now properly compare the blocks and return the expected results, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
