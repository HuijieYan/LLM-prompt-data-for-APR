The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It first checks if the `axes` of both instances are equal, then consolidates the blocks in both instances and compares each block for equality. 

The bug in the function arises because the comparison of `axes` does not take into account the order of the axes. Additionally, when consolidating the blocks, the comparison does not consider the order of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of axes and block ordering in the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The comparison of `axes` has been modified to individually check for equality between each axis in the lists.
- The `canonicalize` function has been modified to include the type of the block as part of the canonicalization, and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` has been replaced with `mgr_locs.as_array.tostring()` to ensure consistent ordering for comparison.
