The buggy function `equals` is not correctly comparing two DataFrames for equality. This is resulting in a failing test, as shown in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". According to the failing test, when comparing two DataFrames, `df1.equals(df2)` must return `False` as the DataFrames are not equal. However, the buggy function returns `True` instead of `False`, leading to an assertion error.

The potential cause of the bug might be the comparison and sorting of blocks within the DataFrames, which is not correctly handling the comparison logic.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly compare each element within the DataFrames and ensure that the comparison logic is aligned with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        (block.index.equals(oblock.index) and block.equals(oblock))
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames is performed correctly, taking into account the index of each block as well. This should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test while also satisfying the expected input/output values.
