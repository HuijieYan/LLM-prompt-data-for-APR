To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that it correctly compares the blocks within the `BlockManager`. Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug is related to the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`.

The issue on GitHub further confirms that the `equals()` method is returning the wrong output when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `equals` function to correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` by taking into account the block placements.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, taking into account block placement
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs
            for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected code, we added an additional check for `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function and the final comparison. This checks whether the block placement is the same for both `self` and `other` blocks.

By adding this check, the corrected `equals` function should now return the expected output, as indicated in the failing test and as per the issue reported on GitHub.
