The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function. The current implementation uses a nested function that is redefined within the buggy function, causing confusion and potential issues with variable scoping.

To fix this bug, we can define the `canonicalize` function outside of the `equals` function, ensuring that it is accessible within the scope of the `equals` function. Additionally, we should remove the redundant `canonicalize` function from within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other class methods...

    # Define the canonicalize function outside of the equals function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By defining the `canonicalize` function outside of the `equals` function and using `self.canonicalize` as the key in the `sorted` function, we ensure that the `canonicalize` function is accessible within the `equals` function and can be used as intended.

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function passes the failing test.
