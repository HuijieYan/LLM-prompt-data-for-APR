The bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class seems to be related to the sorting and comparison of block values in the self.blocks and other.blocks tuples for the given case.

Potential error locations:
1. The canonicalize function is not defined correctly inside the equals method.
2. The sorting and comparison of self.blocks and other.blocks with the sorted canonicalized values might not be returning the correct comparison results.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function tries to sort and compare blocks within self.blocks and other.blocks based on a canonicalized key, but the canonicalize function is not defined correctly. This may lead to incorrect sorting and comparison results.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Define the canonicalize function correctly within the BlockManager class, making sure it returns the expected canonicalized value for each block.
2. Update the sorting and comparison logic to correctly use the canonicalized values for blocks within self.blocks and other.blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function correctly
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the canonicalize function has been defined correctly to return a tuple containing the block's dtype as a string and its mgr_locs. The sorting and comparison logic has been updated to use these canonicalized values for blocks within self.blocks and other.blocks, which should result in correct comparison results.
