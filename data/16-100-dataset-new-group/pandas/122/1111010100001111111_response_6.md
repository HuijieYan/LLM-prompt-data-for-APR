The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is caused by the method handling identical blocks with different locations and not returning the expected result. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem with the `equals` method returning `True` for identical blocks with different locations, when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be adjusted to properly account for blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now creates a tuple from the `mgr_locs` to properly account for different block locations. This should address the bug and ensure that the `equals` function returns the expected result.

This update will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
