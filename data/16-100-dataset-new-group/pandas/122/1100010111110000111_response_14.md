## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
- The buggy function fails the test_dataframe_not_equal test as it returns True even when the dataframes df1 and df2 are not equal.
- The original implementation of the "canonicalize" function did not compare the block values using "block.values.equals(oblock.values)".
- The cause of the bug is that the canonicalization method did not properly compare the block values, leading to incorrect results when checking dataframe equality.
- To fix this bug, the canonicalize function should compare the block values using the "block.values.equals(oblock.values)" method, ensuring that the block values are correctly compared for equality.
- The corrected version of the function addresses this issue by comparing the block values using "block.values.equals(oblock.values)" within the canonicalize function.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function works as expected, passing the failing test and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
