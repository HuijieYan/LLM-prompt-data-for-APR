The bug in the `equals` function causes it to wrongly return `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. The code is failing to correctly compare the blocks because the `canonicalize` function is not properly sorting the blocks and their locations based on dtype and location. This leads to the incorrect comparison and incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to properly handle and sort the blocks based on dtype and location, which will ensure that blocks with different locations but identical data will be correctly treated as not equal.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the dtype and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version includes the proper handling and sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that blocks with different locations but identical data will be correctly treated as not equal.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function works as expected for DataFrame comparisons.
