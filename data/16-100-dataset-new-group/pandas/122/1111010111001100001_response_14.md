The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test. The bug arises when comparing the blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects.

The potential error locations within the `equals` function are:
1. The comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. The comparison of the number of blocks in `self` and `other`.
3. The comparison of individual blocks within `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of blocks is not being conducted properly due to incorrect sorting and comparison methods. This is leading to an incorrect determination of equality between two `BlockManager` objects.

To fix the bug, the comparison method for blocks needs to be revised to ensure that it correctly compares the content of the blocks while taking into account their positions within the `BlockManager` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the block values and locations, the comparison between blocks is now taking into account their actual content and position within the `BlockManager` objects. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
