The issue seems to be with the DataFrame.equals() method returning True in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations. 

The buggy function 'equals' has several potential error locations:
1. The comparison of axes may be incorrect, leading to returning False even when the data is identical but has different block locations.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks based on their type name and manager locations may result in incorrect comparisons.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect comparison of block locations, leading to a False positive when comparing identical data with different locations.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison of the axes and block locations to account for cases where the data is identical but has different block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the 'equals' function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the 'equals' function should now correctly handle the comparison of identical data with different block locations and return the expected result.
