## Correction

The buggy function `equals` is comparing the axes and blocks of two objects. The bug might be caused by the incorrect comparison of the object attributes or the sorting of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is performed correctly and consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.flatten()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.flatten()

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # sort and compare the blocks
    self_blocks.sort()
    other_blocks.sort()

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version ensures that the axes are compared correctly and the blocks are compared after being flattened and sorted. This should satisfy the expected input/output values.
