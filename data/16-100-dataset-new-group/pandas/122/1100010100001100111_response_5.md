The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of block locations. Based on the runtime values and the GitHub issue, it appears that the function is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug is likely the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which only considers the block's dtype name and manager locations. This can lead to incorrect comparison results, as the bug report suggests.

To fix the bug, the comparison of block locations should be revisited. Instead of relying solely on the sorting of blocks by dtype name and manager locations, a more comprehensive approach to block comparison should be implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block in self_blocks with each block in other_blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, each block in `self_blocks` is compared with the corresponding block in `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. This ensures a comprehensive comparison of the blocks, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
