The bug in the equals function is causing the test_dataframe_not_equal test to fail. The equals function is comparing two BlockManager objects by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug is likely in the comparison logic of the blocks.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it appears that the comparison logic for the blocks might be flawed. The blocks are being sorted and then compared element-wise for equality. However, the sorting and comparison logic might not be correctly handling the comparison of the blocks.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the comparison logic for the blocks. Instead of directly comparing the blocks element-wise, we can compare the internal data of the blocks to check for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs) and np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we are comparing the mgr_locs and values of each block for equality. By using np.array_equal for comparing the values of the blocks, it ensures that the comparison is performed accurately. This should address the bug and fix the failing test.
