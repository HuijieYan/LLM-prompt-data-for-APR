The buggy function `equals` does not handle cases where the data blocks in the two dataframes have the same content but are located differently. This causes the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to return `True` when it should return `False`. The expected variables and types at the function's return are provided from the failing test's expected output.

To fix the bug:
- The function needs to sort the data blocks in both dataframes before comparing them.
- The `canonicalize` function needs to be defined correctly and used to sort the data blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After correcting the function, running the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass and return `False`.
