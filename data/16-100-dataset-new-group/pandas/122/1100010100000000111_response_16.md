Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may not be correctly identifying the equality of the blocks.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the `equals` function to incorrectly return True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is because the comparison mechanism is not correctly identifying the equality of the blocks.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to rewrite the comparison logic for `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to correctly identify the equality of the blocks.

Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # compare the blocks directly to check for equality
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```
This corrected version directly compares the blocks to check for equality. If any block is not equal, it will return False. Otherwise, it will return True. This should fix the issue reported in GitHub.
