The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the comparison of blocks in the `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The error message indicates that the `equals` function is not returning the expected result when comparing the two DataFrames.

The potential cause of the bug is that the blocks in `self` and `other` might not be compared in a consistent manner, leading to the failure of the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, we can modify the canonicalization process of the blocks to ensure that they are compared consistently.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to ensure consistent comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the function should be able to properly compare the blocks in the `self` and `other` BlockManagers, and return the correct result.
