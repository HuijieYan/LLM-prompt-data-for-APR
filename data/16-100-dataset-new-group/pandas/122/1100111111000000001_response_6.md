The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class in the `managers.py` file is not correctly comparing the dataframes and returning the wrong result. This is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect comparison of dataframes.
2. Incorrect sorting and comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
3. Incorrect use of the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the dataframes and their blocks, leading to the wrong result.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to properly compare the dataframes and their blocks.
2. Update the sorting logic to correctly sort the blocks for comparison.
3. Remove the redundant `canonicalize` function from the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version, we have removed the unnecessary sorting and comparison logic for `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and directly perform the comparison using the `equals` method of the block objects.

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
