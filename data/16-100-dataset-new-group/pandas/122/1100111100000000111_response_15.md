The bug in the `equals` function causes it to incorrectly return True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This issue is described in the GitHub post, where a simple test case involving two DataFrames with the same data but different column order fails to return False as expected.

The main cause of the bug lies in the comparison of blocks within the DataFrames. The function incorrectly compares the blocks using their original order without considering their locations, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should take into account their locations and ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly marked as unequal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, id(block))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block's dtype and its unique identifier (id) to differentiate blocks with the same data but different locations. This ensures that blocks with identical data but different locations are properly compared.

This fix will address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
