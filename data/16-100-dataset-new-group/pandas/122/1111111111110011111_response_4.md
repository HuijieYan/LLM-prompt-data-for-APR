To fix the bug, we need to modify the equals function in the BlockManager class. The issue arises from the fact that the function does not correctly compare the dataframes df1 and df2 and returns an incorrect value, leading to the failing test. This is a bug because the expected result should be False, but the buggy function returns True.

The problem is in the equals function within the BlockManager class. The function compares the axes, consolidates inplace both self and other, and then compares the blocks within self and other.

The issue can be resolved by correctly comparing the blocks within self and other. This can be done by sorting the blocks based on a key that combines the type name and the locs of the blocks and then comparing the sorted blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the self and other blocks based on the type name and the locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version will address the issue and ensure that the equals function returns the expected result, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
