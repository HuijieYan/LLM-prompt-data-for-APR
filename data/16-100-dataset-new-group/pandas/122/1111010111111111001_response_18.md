The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test. The bug is likely within the comparison logic for the blocks in the `sorted` lists. This issue causes the method to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two unequal DataFrames, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison logic correctly checks for equality between the corresponding blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating through the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances and comparing them individually, we ensure that the method checks for equality correctly. This should fix the bug and allow the method to pass the failing test.
