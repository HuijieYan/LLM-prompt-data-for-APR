The buggy function `equals` is found within the `BlockManager` class, and it is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function first checks for the equality of the axes of the two instances. Then it consolidates the instances in place and compares the number and order of their blocks. Finally, it sorts and compares the individual blocks within each `BlockManager` instance.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the comparison of the axes, the consolidation of blocks, and the sorting and comparison of individual blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly compare the individual blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. This leads to incorrect equality assessment, causing the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to produce the wrong result.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately compare the individual blocks within the `BlockManager` instances to ensure correct equality assessment.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare individual blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    return True
```
With this fix, the function now iterates through the individual blocks of both `BlockManager` instances and compares them for equality. If any blocks are found to be not equal, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

This corrected version should address the issue described on GitHub and pass the failing test.
