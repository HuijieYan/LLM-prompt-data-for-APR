To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue related to identifying identical blocks with different locations. The `equals` function is failing to correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrame, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. We should ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function is accurate and accounts for any differences in location.
2. The comparison should take into consideration the index, dtype, and data within each block to determine equality.
3. We should sort and compare the blocks based on their characteristics to identify any discrepancies between the DataFrames.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs, block.dtype))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have introduced a new sorting mechanism for the blocks, taking into account both the block's location using `mgr_locs` and its data type using `dtype`. This ensures that the comparison of blocks is accurate and considers any differences in location. This should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and correctly identify discrepancies between DataFrames.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values for the bug scenario described.
