The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the failing test. The expected and actual values of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are not being correctly compared. 

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be updated to account for the correct comparison of blocks, and the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` needs to consider all block types and their corresponding locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._get_internals(), block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function captures both the internals and values of each block, and the sorting is based on this combined information. This allows for a correct comparison of blocks, ensuring that the `equals` method returns the expected result.
