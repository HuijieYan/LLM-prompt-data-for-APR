The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return True when it should return False in the failing test case. Based on the failing test case and runtime values, it is identified that the bug occurs when comparing the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables.

The buggy function fails to correctly compare the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` by iterating through each block and checking for equality. This failure occurs because the blocks are not sorted in the same order before the comparison, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should first ensure that the blocks are sorted in the same order before performing the equality check. This will provide a consistent comparison and ensure that the function returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by dtype name and mgr_locs for consistent comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will consistently sort the blocks before comparing them, ensuring that the function returns the correct result.

This corrected version of the function will resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test by correctly returning False when comparing the provided DataFrames.
