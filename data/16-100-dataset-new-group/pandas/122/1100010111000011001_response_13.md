The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is meant to compare two objects and return True if they are equal, and False otherwise.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the comparisons and sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function does not handle the comparison between the dataframes correctly. This causes the comparison between `df1` and `df2` in the failing test to return True, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle the comparison of dataframes correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the block's type and then the data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.values.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the block's type and its data to create a unique identifier for each block. This ensures that the comparison between the dataframes is done correctly.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
