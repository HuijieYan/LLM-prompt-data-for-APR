The issue with the `equals` function seems to be that it returns True in cases where the DataFrame's blocks have identical data but are located in different positions. This behavior is not as expected and needs to be fixed.

To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks of the two DataFrames based on their data, rather than their positions. The corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on data, ignoring their positions
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values) 

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the data in the blocks of the DataFrames and return False for the test case provided in the failing test. This will resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
