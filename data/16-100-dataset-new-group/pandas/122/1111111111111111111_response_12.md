The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is causing it to return `True` incorrectly in some cases where it should be returning `False`. The issue reported on GitHub highlights an instance of this bug where the `df3.equals(df4)` statement should return `False` but returns `True` instead.

The bug appears to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. Specifically, when comparing the blocks, the function does not take into account the order of the blocks, which can result in the comparison returning `True` when it should actually be `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are ordered and compared correctly. One approach to do this is to sort the blocks based on their type name and location.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Existing class and methods ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The corrected version sorts the blocks using a `canonicalize` function that creates a tuple combining the type name and the `mgr_locs`. This ensures that the blocks are ordered consistently before the comparison, addressing the issue of returning `True` incorrectly.

With this fix, the `equals` function should now return the correct result, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
