The buggy function "equals" is a method of the BlockManager class in the file pandas/core/internals/managers.py. This method is used to compare two BlockManager instances and determine if they are equal. However, the method is failing when comparing two DataFrames, as shown in the failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" in the file pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py.

The cause of the bug is that the "equals" method is incorrectly sorting and comparing the blocks within the BlockManager. This results in an incorrect comparison of the two DataFrames, leading to the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix this bug, the canonicalization of blocks should be modified to ensure that DataFrames are correctly compared without any data type issues.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.values,
            str(block.dtypes),
            block.mgr_locs.indexer,
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass without any assertion errors.
