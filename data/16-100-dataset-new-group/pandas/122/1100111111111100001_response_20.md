The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is being called incorrectly. The buggy function is trying to call the `canonicalize` function defined outside the class `BlockManager`, which is not allowed because the `canonicalize` function should be called from within the class. This leads to an error in the sorting of the blocks, causing the `equals` function to fail the test.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be defined within the `BlockManager` class so that it can be properly called by the `equals` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Correctly define the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function calls the `canonicalize` function that is defined within the `BlockManager` class and sorts the blocks based on its output. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
