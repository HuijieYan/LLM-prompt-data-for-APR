Based on the provided information, it looks like the buggy function "equals" in the BlockManager class is not correctly comparing the axes and blocks of two DataFrames. The issue posted on GitHub indicates that the `equals` function mistakenly returns True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly compares the axes and blocks of the two DataFrames and returns False if they are not the same.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Ensure that both BlockManagers are consolidated before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order by sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Sort the blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the axes are compared correctly and that the blocks are properly sorted and compared to address the issue described on GitHub. If the failing test is executed with this corrected function, it should pass and return the expected output of False when comparing the given DataFrames.
