The buggy function is the `equals` method, which is part of the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The method first checks if the axes of the self and other BlockManager objects are equal in length, then iterates through each axis to check for equality. Next, it consolidates the self and other BlockManager objects in place and compares the number of blocks. Finally, it compares each block in the self and other BlockManager objects for equality.

The bug in this function is likely related to how it handles the comparison of the blocks in the BlockManager objects, given that the axes and the number of blocks have been determined to be equal.

One potential strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the comparison of the blocks is executed correctly. This may involve examining how the `equals` method of individual blocks is implemented. Additionally, the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function may also need to be examined to ensure it achieves the desired block order for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order, using a canonicalize_dict created from a zip of self.blocks and other.blocks
    canonicalize_dict = {id(pair[0]): pair[1] for pair in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)}
    canonicalize_key = lambda block: canonicalize_dict[id(block)]
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the function, a `canonicalize_dict` is created by zipping `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, then sorted based on the `canonicalize_key` to maintain block order for comparison. This ensures that the comparison of blocks is consistent and accurate.
