## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is failing to handle the transition into daylight saving time. This is causing the labels to be shifted, leading to incorrect binning. The issue is that the method is not adjusting for this shift.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_get_time_bins` function, particularly in the handling of time edges and binning in the presence of transitions like daylight saving time.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the failure to handle transitions such as daylight saving time when generating time bins and labels. This leads to misaligned bin edges and labels, resulting in incorrect binning.

### Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the bin edges and labels to account for transitions like daylight saving time. This may involve identifying the index of the transition, then aligning bin edges and labels accordingly.

### Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().tz_localize(None)
    last = ax.max().tz_localize(None) + self.freq

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        name=ax.name,
        tz=ax.tz,
        closed=self.closed,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version takes into account time transitions like daylight saving time when generating bin edges and labels. This should ensure correct binning, addressing the bug.
