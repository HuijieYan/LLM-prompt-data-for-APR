The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely related to the handling of daylight saving time transitions, as evident from the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`. When a transition to or from daylight saving time occurs, it can affect the calculation of the bins and labels, leading to incorrect results.

The bug is related to:
1. Incorrect calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps, which may not account for the daylight saving time transition.
2. Inadequate handling of timezone adjustments when creating `binner` and `labels`.

To fix the bug, the handling of daylight saving time transitions needs to be improved. This may involve using a different approach to calculate `first` and `last` timestamps and ensuring that timezone adjustments are correctly accounted for when creating `binner` and `labels`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version:
- The `first` timestamp is obtained by normalizing the first timestamp in the index, and the `last` timestamp is calculated by adding one day to the normalized last timestamp in the index. This should account for daylight saving time transitions and ensure that the bins cover the entire range correctly.
- When creating `binner` and `labels`, the `start` and `end` arguments for `date_range` are adjusted to ensure that the timestamps produced are accurate and include the entire range without inconsistencies due to daylight saving time transitions.
