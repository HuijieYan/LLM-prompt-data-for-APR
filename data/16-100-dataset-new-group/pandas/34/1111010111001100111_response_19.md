The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class. The issue arises when the timestamps for a clock change day in certain time zones (e.g., Cuba) are handled, causing an AmbiguousTimeError.

The cause of the bug is related to how the `date_range` function is used to create the bins and labels. Specifically, the method of generating the bins and labels does not properly handle the ambiguity in timestamps that occur during a clock change day in certain time zones.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the logic within the `_get_time_bins` function to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly. One approach to this is to consider using `pandas.Interval` objects instead of directly using `date_range` for creating the bins and labels. By using `pandas.Interval`, the time bins can be explicitly defined, avoiding the issue with ambiguous timestamps during clock changes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    # Generate bins using intervals to handle ambiguous timestamps
    intervals = pd.interval_range(start=ax.min(), end=ax.max(), freq=self.freq, closed=self.closed)
    binner = labels = intervals.left
    bin_edges = intervals.right
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we use `pd.interval_range` to generate the time intervals, allowing for explicit definition and handling of ambiguous timestamps. This should resolve the issue with ambiguous timestamps during clock changes, as reported in the GitHub issue.

By using `pd.interval_range`, the bins and labels will be properly defined, potentially solving the problem with ambiguous timestamps and making the code more robust in handling time zone transitions.
