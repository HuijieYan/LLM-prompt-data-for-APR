To fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function, we need to handle the ambiguous timestamps when working with time zones. The issue on GitHub explains that in Cuba, on a long clock-change day, midnight local time is ambiguous. This scenario was not handled correctly by the `groupby` function when using `pd.Grouper` to downsample the data.

To address this issue, we need to make sure that the ambiguous timestamps are handled properly when creating the date range. We can modify the function to account for the ambiguous midnight timestamp during the clock change.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust for ambiguous timestamps during clock change
    start = ax.min()
    end = ax.max()
    if len(ax.tz._transition_info) > 0:
        transitions = ax.tz._transition_info
        for t in transitions:
            if start < t['transition'] < end:
                end = t['transition']
                break
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        start, end, self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we adjusted the start and end timestamps to ensure that the ambiguous timestamps due to the clock change are handled properly. By considering the transition information from the time zone, we can accurately determine the start and end timestamps for the date range.

These changes should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `groupby` operation with daily frequency works correctly, even on clock change days in Cuba.
