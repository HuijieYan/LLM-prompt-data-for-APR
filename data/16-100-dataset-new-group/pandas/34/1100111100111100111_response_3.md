The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the timezone change in Havana, Cuba, which is not handled properly by the function. This is triggered by a call to `groupby` with a daily frequency, which should return three groups (one for each day) but raises an AmbiguousTimeError on the clock change day.

The bug is likely related to the way the `date_range` function is called, leading to ambiguous timestamps, which triggers the error. The issue on GitHub confirms that this problem was similar to a previously fixed issue, but it seems that the fix didn't fully resolve this specific case.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle the ambiguous time during the clock change day in Cuba correctly. One way to address this is to check for ambiguous times and handle them appropriately when creating the `binner` and `labels`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first.replace(tzinfo=None),  # Remove timezone to avoid ambiguous time
        end=last.replace(tzinfo=None),  # Remove timezone to avoid ambiguous time
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By removing the time zone information from `first` and `last` before calling `date_range`, the function should handle ambiguous times correctly, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue for the test case described in the GitHub issue.
