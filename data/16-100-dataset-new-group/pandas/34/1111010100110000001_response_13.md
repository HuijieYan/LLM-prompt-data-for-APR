The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This error occurs when there are repeated times within the timezone due to daylight saving changes, and the algorithm is unable to infer the correct daylight saving time. This points to an issue with how the time bins are being generated.

The main issue in the `_get_time_bins` function is the use of the `date_range` function to generate the bins and labels. This method does not handle daylight savings time transitions gracefully, which is leading to the error. Additionally, there seems to be a mismatch in the handling of time labels and bins when the time axis has NaN values.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to use a different method for generating the bins, one that is more robust when dealing with timezone transitions and daylight saving changes. Additionally, the handling of NaN values in the time axis should be reviewed and adjusted if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Generate bins and labels using a more robust approach
    bins = ax.asfreq(self.freq)
    labels = bins.shift(1, freq=self.freq)
    
    # Adjust labels and bins according to the specified convention
    if self.closed == 'right':
        bins += bins.freq
    if self.label == 'right':
        labels = bins

    return bins, bins, labels
```

With these changes, the function should now be able to generate bins and labels correctly, taking proper care of timezone transitions and daylight saving changes. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
