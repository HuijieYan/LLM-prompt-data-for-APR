The cause of the bug is that the `_get_time_bins` function in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group by time bins that include a clock change day in regions with daylight saving time. This issue was reported on GitHub with the title "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba."

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function must properly handle ambiguous timestamps and ensure that time bins are calculated correctly, so that grouping by time does not lead to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bin_edges = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    binner, bins = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax_values, bin_edges)

    labels = binner
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_time_bins` function should properly handle ambiguous timestamps and generate time bins, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub. Running the failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should now pass without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
