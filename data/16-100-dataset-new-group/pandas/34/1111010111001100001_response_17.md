The issue with the function seems to be related to the labeling and binning process, where the bins and labels are not correctly aligned. This causes the discrepancy between the expected and actual output.

The potential error location within the function appears to be in the calculation and adjustment of the bin edges, as well as the alignment between the bins and labels. Additionally, the manipulation of the labels and bins based on the closed and label parameters could also be a source of the bug.

The cause of the bug is a misalignment between the generated bins and labels due to incorrect adjustments of bin edges, as well as discrepancies in handling the closed and label parameters. This results in an incorrect assignment of values to the bins and labels, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the bin edges are correctly adjusted and aligned with the labels based on the closed and label parameters. Additionally, the handling of nanosecond values and adjustments to the labels when there are more labels than bins need to be properly managed to avoid discrepancies.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Calculate the bins based on the adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right":
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust the labels if there are more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making these adjustments to the function, we ensure that the bin edges are correctly aligned with the labels and handle the closed and label parameters appropriately. This should resolve the misalignment and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
