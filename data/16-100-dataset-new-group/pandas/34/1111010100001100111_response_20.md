The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when performing a groupby with daily frequency on a long clock-change day in Cuba. The issue is that on this specific day, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, leading to the error. This can be addressed by ensuring that the bin edges are correctly handled to account for this ambiguity.

The bug occurs when `date_range` is used to generate the `binner` and `labels`. Due to the use of `start=first` and `end=last` as arguments, the nanosecond part is not taken into consideration, leading to a discrepancy in the generated bins and labels. This ultimately results in the AmbiguousTimeError on long clock-change days.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to ensure that the timestamps are accurately handled, especially when generating the bins and labels using `date_range`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor(self.freq)
    last = ax[-1].ceil(self.freq)
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        periods=len(ax) + 1,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right" else binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version ensures that the bin edges are appropriately adjusted to handle the ambiguous timestamps, thus preventing the AmbiguousTimeError from occurring on long clock-change days in Cuba.
