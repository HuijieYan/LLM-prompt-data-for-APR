The issue described on GitHub explains that the `groupby` operation with daily frequency fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change day in Cuba. The specific problem occurs with the `pd.Grouper` function when used on a day with a time change event, resulting in an ambiguous timestamp. The expected output is to return three groups, corresponding to each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), including the group for the 4th labeled with the timestamp "2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00" and containing the hourly data points for that dayâ€”even before the clock change.

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` has a few possible error locations that could potentially cause the failure:
1. The calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps using `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, which may not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.
2. The construction of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range`, where the `end` may not account for the clock change event.
3. The adjustment of `labels` when the number of bins is less than the number of labels.

To fix this bug, we can update the `_get_time_bins` function to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps when creating the `binner` and `labels`. We can also make sure that adjustments to `labels` accommodate the possibility of clock change events.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Calculate the timestamp range edges while accounting for the timezone
    freq_offset = to_offset(self.freq)
    first = ax.min().floor(freq_offset)
    last = ax.max().ceil(freq_offset)

    # Construct binner and labels using date_range with the closed parameter set to 'right'
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        closed='right',  # Ensure that the end is included in the range
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Adjust bin edges based on the ax values
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on the closed and label parameters
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # Insert NaT if ax has NaN values
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels to match the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle ambiguous timestamps correctly on clock change days, and the failing test case should produce the expected result without raising the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
