The bug occurs when the `date_range` function is used to create the `binner` and `labels` variables within the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class. The issue arises from the fact that the `date_range` function does not handle the transition from standard time to daylight saving time correctly, as indicated by the error message `Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times`. This is due to the fact that the `date_range` function does not support creating ranges that span ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions.

To fix this bug, a solution is to replace the use of `date_range` with a custom implementation that handles these time transitions correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize() + 1  # Add one day to include the last day
    
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax, first, last)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the use of `date_range` has been replaced with the creation of `first` and `last` variables using the `normalize` method to handle daylight saving time transitions correctly. Furthermore, the `_adjust_bin_edges` and `lib.generate_bins_dt64` functions are used to handle bin edges and bin generation in a way that is consistent with handling daylight saving time transitions.
