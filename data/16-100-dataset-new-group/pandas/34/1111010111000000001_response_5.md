The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in the `pandas` library. The function is used to create time bins for the given axis (time index).

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The calculation of `first` and `last` may not be correct.
2. The adjustment of bin edges in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function may not be working as expected.
3. The generation of bins using the `lib.generate_bins_dt64` function may have issues, especially when dealing with timezones and daylight saving time.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect calculation of time bins, which leads to mismatched data in the resulting grouped dataframe. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` demonstrates this issue when trying to downsample data with timezone conversion and daylight saving time adjustments.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be:
1. Check the calculation of `first` and `last` to ensure that they encompass the entire range of the time index axis.
2. Review the `_adjust_bin_edges` function to ensure that the bin edges are adjusted correctly based on the axis values.
3. Validate the generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` to handle timezones and daylight saving time adjustments correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Calculate first and last based on the timezone
    ax_tz = ax.tz if ax.tz is not None else "UTC"
    first = ax.min().tz_localize(ax_tz)
    last = ax.max().tz_localize(ax_tz) + self.freq

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins using adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, na_position="last"
    )

    # Adjust labels based on closed and label parameters
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if there are more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected version, the calculation of `first` and `last` takes into account the timezone of the axis, `_adjust_bin_edges` is called with appropriate parameters, and `lib.generate_bins_dt64` is used with the correct arguments to ensure proper generation of bins.

This corrected version should address the issues with the original buggy function and pass the failing test.
