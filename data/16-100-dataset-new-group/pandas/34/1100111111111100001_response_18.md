The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing an AmbiguousTimeError, as seen in the failing test. The main issue seems to be related to the timezone adjustments and the binning process.

The bug stems from how the `date_range` function is being used, specifically in the context of timezones and ambiguous times. It's failing to properly handle daylight saving time transitions, hence the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle timezone localization and conversions, particularly addressing ambiguous times. This can be done by using the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` methods appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().tz_localize(None).normalize()
    last = ax.max().tz_localize(None).normalize() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)  # Adding a day to ensure all timestamps are included
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, ambiguous="infer", tz=ax.tz, closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we are ensuring that the timezone localization and adjustment handling are done correctly, and we are also applying the appropriate offsets to handle ambiguous times. This should fix the issue and prevent the AmbiguousTimeError from occurring.
