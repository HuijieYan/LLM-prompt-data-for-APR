The buggy function `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test due to the incorrect way it handles time index adjustments.

The buggy function is trying to handle ambiguous time labels by using the `ambiguous="infer"` argument while creating a date range. However, it seems to mishandle the adjustment of labels and bins while considering the closed end of the interval.

To fix the bug, the approach would be to separate the handling of ambiguous time labels from the adjustment of bins and labels based on the closed end of the interval. Additionally, the incorrect handling of the `ambiguous` argument in the `date_range` function needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,        
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name
    )
    bin_edges = binner
    if self.closed == "right":
        bin_edges = bin_edges.shift(1, freq=self.freq)
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version should address the issues related to the adjustment of bins and labels based on the closed end of the interval and should correctly handle ambiguous time labels. This should allow the failing test to pass without raising the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
