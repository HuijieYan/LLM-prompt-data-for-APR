The bug is likely in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The error message from the failing test indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is being raised when creating date ranges, specifically on a clock change day in Cuba. This points to an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps during the groupby operation.

The `AmbiguousTimeError` occurs due to the fact that on clock change days, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, and `pd.Grouper` is not handling this correctly. The expected output is three groups, one for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), and the group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00'.

The issue seems similar to a previous bug (#23742) but was not fixed in pandas 0.24.

To resolve this issue, the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class needs to be modified to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. Specifically, the generation of date ranges and the handling of ambiguous timestamps need to be revised.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Check for ambiguous times and handle them appropriately
    ambiguous_mask = ax.isin(ax.tz._utc_transition_times)
    ax = ax.tz_localize(None)
    ax_values = ax.asi8

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    # Handle the case of ambiguous midnight time on clock change days
    if self.freq == "1D" and np.any(ambiguous_mask):
        binner = binner.drop(ambiguous_mask)
        labels = labels.drop(ambiguous_mask)

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected version, we explicitly handle ambiguous times during the date range generation by checking for the presence of ambiguous times and dropping them if the frequency is 1D. We then proceed with the normal calculation of bins and labels.

This should resolve the issue with `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days in Cuba, and make the groupby operation work as expected.
