The bug seems to be related to the handling of daylight saving time (DST). The error message indicates an "AmbiguousTimeError," suggesting an issue with inferring DST time due to no repeated times. This points to an issue with the conversion between timezones when daylight saving time is in effect.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the conversion of time between different timezones when creating the `binner` and `labels`. This conversion might be causing the ambiguous time error due to the presence of repeated times or other issues related to DST.

The cause of the bug is likely that the function `_get_time_bins` is incorrectly handling timezones and DST, resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError. This could be due to a mismatch between timezones, improper handling of repeated or ambiguous times during the conversion.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure proper handling of timezones and DST when creating the `binner` and `labels`. Specifically, care should be taken to handle ambiguous times and repeated times in a way that does not lead to the AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0] if self.closed == 'left' else ax[0] - 1
    last = ax[-1] if self.closed == 'left' else ax[-1] + 1

    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
    bins = binner.searchsorted(ax, side="left" if self.closed == 'left' else "right")

    if self.label == 'right':
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner[:-1]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function aims to resolve issues related to DST and ambiguous times by using the `searchsorted` method to determine the bins. This method handles timezones and DST in a way that avoids the AmbiguousTimeError.
