The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the calculation of the `last` timestamp. In particular, the logic to calculate `last` using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` seems to be incorrect, as it is causing discrepancies in the resulting `bin_edges` and `bins`.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the logic for calculating the `last` timestamp and ensure that it aligns with the desired behavior for the time grouping.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _get_time_bins function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max() + self.freq  # Corrected logic to calculate 'last'

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the logic to calculate the `last` timestamp has been modified to ensure that it aligns with the behavior for the time grouping. This modification should address the discrepancy in the resulting `bin_edges` and `bins`.
