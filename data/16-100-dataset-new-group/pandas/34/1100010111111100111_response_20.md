### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because on a long clock-change day in Cuba, such as 2018-11-04, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. The call to `groupby` in the code fails and raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This is due to the way `pd.Grouper` handles the time bins on the ambiguous date leading to an error in calling `groupby`.

The function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `pandas` library's resample feature, and it fails to handle the ambiguous timestamp and the time change when converting from UTC to a time zone with Daylight Saving Time (DST) changes, such as America/Havana. It also fails to correctly create the time bins based on the frequency provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `date_range` used to create the time bins should be modified to handle the Daylight Saving Time (DST) changes and the ambiguous timestamp. Additionally, the time labels and bin edges should be adjusted to ensure that they align with the frequency provided. The `Bins` and `Labels` should be generated in a way that accounts for the DST changes and ambiguous timestamps.

### Corrected Code
Based on the bug explanation and fix strategy, here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Create time bins with handling for DST changes and ambiguous timestamps
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function uses the `date_range` function with the appropriate parameters to handle the DST changes and ambiguous timestamps when creating the time bins. Additionally, the labels and bin adjustment logic remains the same. After implementing this corrected version, the `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` test should now pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
