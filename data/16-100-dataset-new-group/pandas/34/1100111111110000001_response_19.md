## Analysis
The error message from the failing test indicates that there is an issue with daylight savings time (DST) transition, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to a non-repeated time at 2018-11-04 00:00:00. This error is likely due to incorrect handling of bin calculations when the time spans a DST transition period.

The `_get_time_bins` function is responsible for generating the time bins for resampling, which in turn leads to the error in the test. It utilizes the `date_range` without considering the potential impacts of DST transitions, resulting in non-repeated times during the transition. Therefore, the cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of DST transitions in the creation of time bins.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to ensure proper handling of DST transitions when creating time bins. This involves taking into account the timezone of the original DatetimeIndex and appropriately adjusting the time bins for any DST transitions. 

## The Corrected Version
```python
from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import DatetimeArray

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
             )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        ax_tz = ax.tz  # store the timezone information
        ax_values = ax.asi8

        # Since the timezone information is now stored, localize the start and end times
        # This will ensure that any DST transitions are taken into account
        first = Timestamp(ax.min(), tz=ax_tz)
        last = Timestamp(ax.max(), tz=ax_tz)
        # Create a range based on the localized start and end times
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax_tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
``` 

By localizing the start and end times and passing the timezone information to `date_range`, the corrected function ensures that DST transitions are properly accounted for when creating time bins for resampling. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` when running tests, and the function should now pass the failing test.
