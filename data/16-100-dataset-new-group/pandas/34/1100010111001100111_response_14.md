The issue reported on GitHub indicates that there is a problem with handling ambiguous timestamps on days with a clock change, causing `pd.Grouper` to raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The specific example provided fails to return the expected result, with the call to `groupby` raising an error.

An analysis of the buggy function, along with the provided test and runtime input/output values, indicates that the cause of the bug is related to the handling of timestamps on the day of the clock change, resulting in incorrect grouping or errors.

Upon reviewing the code, the focus should be on handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on the day of the clock change. It seems that the current logic fails to correctly adjust the timestamps to accommodate the change in local time.

To fix the bug, a strategy would involve adjusting the date range and handling the ambiguous timestamps specifically for the day of the clock change. This could involve checking for ambiguous timestamps and adjusting the groups accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjusting the timezone to handle ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change
    tz_adjusted_start = ax[0].normalize()
    tz_adjusted_end = ax[-1].normalize() + Timedelta(days=1) - Timedelta(seconds=1)

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        tz_adjusted_start, tz_adjusted_end, self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Use the adjusted first/last and timezone for the date range
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes adjustments for handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on the day of the clock change, by adjusting the timezone and ensuring that the date range encompasses the entire period correctly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test, `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, passes successfully.
