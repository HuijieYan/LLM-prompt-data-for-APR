The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the pandas library, which is used for time-interval grouping. The function takes a `DatetimeIndex` object `ax` as input, along with several other relevant parameters including `freq`, `closed`, `label`, `convention`, and `base`.

The buggy function then raises a `TypeError` if the input `ax` is not an instance of `DatetimeIndex`. It then calculates the `first` and `last` values for the time range, and uses them to generate `binner`, `labels`, and `bin_edges`.

The bug arises due to the incorrect generation of the `labels` and `bins`. Specifically, the slicing and adjustments made to the `labels` and `bins` arrays are resulting in inconsistencies and incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic used to generate the `labels` and `bins` arrays to ensure accurate and consistent results.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Generate binner and labels
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    # Use general version to generate bins
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    return binner, bins, binner
```

In this corrected version, the logic for generating `binner` and `bins` has been revised to ensure accurate and consistent results. This should resolve the bug and enable the function to pass the failing test.
