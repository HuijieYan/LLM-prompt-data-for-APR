The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when it tries to infer the daylight saving time when using the `tz_localize` function. This error occurs when there are no repeated times during the transition from standard time to daylight saving time or vice versa. 

The bug seems to be caused by the fact that the function is not handling the transition between standard time and daylight saving time correctly when creating the `binner` and `labels` with the `date_range` function. This results in an incorrect time binning and triggers the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify how we create the `binner` and `labels` to correctly handle the transition between standard time and daylight saving time.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Ensure time zone is preserved
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by marking them as NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we have explicitly set the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function to "NaT", which tells pandas to handle ambiguous times by marking them as NaT. This should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring. Additionally, we have preserved the time zone when creating the `binner` and `labels` to ensure consistency.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
