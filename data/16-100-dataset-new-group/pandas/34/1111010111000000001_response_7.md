The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to generate time bins for time-interval grouping, but there are several potential error locations within the function:

1. The use of `date_range` to create the `binner` and `labels` variables without handling the case where the start and end times could be affected by DST transitions or time zone changes. This can lead to incorrect bin edges and labels.

2. The comparison of the length of `bins` and `labels` without considering the interaction between time zone changes and the frequency of the bins.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the potential impact of DST transitions or time zone changes adequately, leading to incorrect bin edges and labels. This results in the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` failing as it expects the downsampled result to account for time zone changes and DST transitions.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle time zone changes and DST transitions correctly when generating bin edges and labels.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    bin_start = ax.min()
    bin_end = ax.max()
    
    if ax.tz is not None:
        bin_start = bin_start.tz_localize(None)
        bin_end = bin_end.tz_localize(None)
        bin_start = bin_start.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")
        bin_end = bin_end.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=bin_start,
        end=bin_end,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we handle time zone changes and DST transitions correctly by adjusting the start and end times before creating the bin edges and labels. This ensures that the time bins are generated accounting for potential changes in time zones and DST transitions, addressing the root cause of the bug.
