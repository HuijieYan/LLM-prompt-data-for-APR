The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing the test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to fail. The bug is related to how the function handles time bins in the presence of a Daylight Saving Time (DST) change. The function is not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Based on the provided runtime values, the cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the transition from daylight saving time to standard time on November 4th, 2018, in the `America/Havana` timezone. Due to this transition, the timestamp '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' is ambiguous, as there are two such timestamps during the change. This ambiguity results in an error and incorrect grouping in the output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps during the DST change. One way to address this is by handling the transition explicitly and adjusting the time bins and labels accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Convert the DatetimeIndex to the target timezone to avoid ambiguity
    ax_target_tz = ax.tz.convert(self.freq.tz)

    binner = pd.date_range(start=ax_target_tz.min(), end=ax_target_tz.max(), freq=self.freq, tz=ax_target_tz.tz, name=ax.name)
    ax_values = ax_target_tz.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected version, the function explicitly converts the input DatetimeIndex to the target timezone to avoid ambiguity and then proceeds with the binning process. This approach should resolve the issue with ambiguous timestamps during the DST change and allow the function to correctly generate time bins for downstream processing.
