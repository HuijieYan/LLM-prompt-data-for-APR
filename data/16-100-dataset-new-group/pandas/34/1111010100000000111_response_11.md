## Analysis
The issue described in the GitHub post is related to the failure of the groupby operation with daily frequency due to an AmbiguousTimeError. The issue occurs on a clock change day, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. This is directly relevant to the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class, as it's part of the process for creating time bins for grouping operations.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is the calculation and adjustment of time bins within the `_get_time_bins` method. It seems that the method does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, which leads to the AmbiguousTimeError.

## Cause of the Bug
The issue is likely caused by the `_get_time_bins` method not taking into account the possibility of ambiguous timestamps when creating time bins. This causes the groupby operation to fail on clock change days, as described in the GitHub issue.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` method to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly. This could involve checking for ambiguous timestamps and appropriately adjusting the time bins to accommodate such cases.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].to_period(self.freq).start_time
    last = ax[-1].to_period(self.freq).end_time

    binner, labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the time bins are calculated using the start and end times of the datetime index, taking into account potential ambiguous timestamps. This should address the issue described in the GitHub post and ensure that the groupby operation with daily frequency works as expected.
