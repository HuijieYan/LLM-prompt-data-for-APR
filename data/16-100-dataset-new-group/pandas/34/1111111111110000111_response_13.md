Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug occurs when trying to group by a daily frequency in a timezone affected by daylight savings time, such as Cuba. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when it is unable to infer the DST time during a clock change day in Cuba.

The bug is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating groups based on a daily frequency. Since the timezone in Cuba has ambiguous timestamps due to the changes in the clock, the grouping operation fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to enhance the handling of ambiguous times in the `_get_time_bins` function when creating the daily frequency groups.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    # Enhance handling of ambiguous times by using the normalized method
    if self.freq == '1D':
        first = first.normalize()
        last = last.normalize()

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes an enhancement for handling ambiguous times by using the `normalize()` method to remove the times part from the timestamps when the frequency is '1D', effectively specifying that the first and last times of each day should be considered as midnight for the grouping operation.

With this correction, the groupby operation should now correctly handle the ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day in Cuba and avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.
