The buggy function `_get_time_bins` checks if the input `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if it's not. It then proceeds to perform operations assuming that `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`. The main potential error locations are:
1. The input `ax` might not be of type `DatetimeIndex`, which would cause a `TypeError` to be raised.
2. Operations are performed assuming `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not of that type.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex` without validating it, and it proceeds to use functions that require `ax` to be of that type, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should add further validation to ensure that `ax` is indeed a `DatetimeIndex` before proceeding with the operations. This can be done using an `isinstance` check combined with error handling to inform the user in case of an invalid input type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Proceed with the rest of the operations assuming ax is a DatetimeIndex
    # ...
```

By adding the `isinstance` check and error handling, we ensure that the function will only proceed with the operations if `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`. If it's not, a `TypeError` will be raised with a clear explanation of the issue.
