Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The use of `date_range` to create labels and bin boundaries without handling the ambiguous time issue.
2. The potential for mismatched labels and bins based on the length of the date range.

Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class is causing problems when grouping datetime data in cases where there is an ambiguous time, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This is illustrated in the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` where the datetime index contains ambiguous time due to a clock change in Cuba, and the grouping operation raises an error instead of producing the expected output.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use `DatetimeIndex` methods to handle ambiguous times and ensure proper alignment of labels and bins.
2. Adjust the `date_range` creation to account for ambiguous times.
3. Check that the length of labels and bins align appropriately based on the length of the date range.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version:
1. Removed the use of `date_range` and replaced it with the `_adjust_bin_edges` method to ensure proper handling of ambiguous times.
2. Adjusted label and bin handling based on the length of the bins to ensure proper alignment.
