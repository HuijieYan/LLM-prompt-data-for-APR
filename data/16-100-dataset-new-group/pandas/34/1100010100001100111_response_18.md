From the input parameters and the values of the variables right before the return of the original function, it's clear that the problem lies in the handling of the timestamps on the day of the clock change, causing ambiguity. This results in the incorrect grouping and labeling of the data.

To fix this issue, the bug needs to be addressed by handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, ensuring that the labels and bins are correctly assigned for the groupby operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    freq = ax.freq or self.freq  # use the axis frequency if available
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed)
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # use lib.generate_bins_overlap_dt64 for correctly handling ambiguous timestamps
    bins = lib.generate_bins_overlap_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, has_nans=ax.hasnans, ambiguous='NaT')

    labels = binner

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version incorporates the handling of ambiguous timestamps using `lib.generate_bins_overlap_dt64`, which ensures that the labels and bins are correctly assigned without ambiguity. This should resolve the issue of incorrect grouping and labeling caused by ambiguous timestamps on the clock change day in Cuba.
