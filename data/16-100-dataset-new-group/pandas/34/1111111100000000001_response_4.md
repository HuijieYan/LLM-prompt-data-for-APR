Based on the provided source code, the buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to generate time bins based on the input `ax`. It checks if `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex` and then proceeds to calculate the time bins.

The potential error locations within the function:
1. The calculation of `binner` and `labels` based on the `freq`, `start`, and `end` is likely where the bug is located.
2. The adjustment of bin edges by calling the `_adjust_bin_edges` function.

The cause of the bug:
The bug may be caused by improper handling of the time bin calculation, particularly in the generation of `binner` and `labels`. This may involve incorrect end calculations, improper handling of time zones, or ambiguous/nonexistent time configurations. Additionally, the adjustment of bin edges might not be functioning as expected.

A strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Double-check the calculation of the `first` and `last` timestamps to ensure they are calculated correctly and handle the nanosecond part accurately.
2. Review the call to `_adjust_bin_edges` to ensure it is appropriately handling the adjustments to the bin edges.
3. Validate the handling of time zones, ambiguous times, and nonexistent times when generating `binner` and `labels`.
4. Verify the logic around handling NaN values and the adjustment of label lengths.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected version, the calculations of `first` and `last` are simplified and the logic around `binner`, `labels`, and adjustment of bins and labels are revised to ensure they handle edge cases and adjustments correctly.
