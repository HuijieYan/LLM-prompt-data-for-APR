The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class of the `pandas/core/resample.py` file is causing the bug. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` triggers the bug with the error message `AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times`. The corresponding GitHub issue is titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba," and it describes an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change in Cuba.

Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculation of `first` and `last` timestamp ranges may cause issues.
2. The application of the frequency to the `date_range` function might be incorrect.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely occurs due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during a clock change in the `date_range` function within the `_get_time_bins` method. This issue causes an AmbiguousTimeError when attempting to infer dst time.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the `date_range` function to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, ensuring that the time is not ambiguous during a clock change. Use the `infer` option to handle ambiguous times appropriately.
2. Consider any other relevant changes based on the specificities of the AmbiguousTimeError.
3. Update the `_get_time_bins` method to reflect the corrected logic with appropriate handling for ambiguous timestamps during clock changes.

The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Set ambiguous handling to `infer` to handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making the above changes to the `_get_time_bins` method, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test case should pass without triggering the AmbiguousTimeError.
