The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas.core.resample` module. The error message indicates that an AmbiguousTimeError is being raised due to an issue with handling timestamps on the day of a clock change in Cuba.

The cause of the bug is related to handling the timestamp range that includes the ambiguous time during the clock change. This results in the AmbiguousTimeError being raised.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to modify the date range creation process to handle the ambiguous time and ensure it is correctly represented in the bins and labels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `first` and `last` timestamps are directly extracted from the input `ax`. Then, the `date_range` function is modified to handle the ambiguous time by setting `ambiguous="infer"` and ensuring that the timestamp range is correctly represented in the bins and labels. This should prevent the AmbiguousTimeError from being raised and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
