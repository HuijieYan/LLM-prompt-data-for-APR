The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The check for whether 'ax' is an instance of 'DatetimeIndex' is incorrect and may raise a TypeError incorrectly.
2. The section where 'binner' and 'labels' are adjusted based on the frequency may be incorrect.
3. The logic for adjusting 'labels' when the number of bins is less than the number of labels ('GH4076') may not handle the situation correctly.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of 'ax' not being a 'DatetimeIndex' and potential issues with adjusting 'binner' and 'labels' based on the frequency.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the type of 'ax' needs to be corrected, the adjustment of 'binner' and 'labels' based on the frequency needs to be reviewed, and the handling of the situation when the number of bins is less than the number of labels needs to be improved.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, (DatetimeIndex, pd.DatetimeIndex)):
        raise TypeError(
            f"axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, has_nans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
Note: The corrected version of the function includes the necessary fixes to handle the potential errors identified earlier. Additionally, the handling of the situation when the number of bins is less than the number of labels has been improved.
