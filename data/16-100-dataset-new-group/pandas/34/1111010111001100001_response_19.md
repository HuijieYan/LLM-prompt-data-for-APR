The bug is caused by the function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class. The function seems to not handle the situation of daylight saving time (DST) properly, as it assumes that the frequency is always for a full day and does not consider the possibility of a shift in the day due to DST.

The function initially checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`, but does not take into account the subtleties of time zone shifts due to DST. This can lead to issues with incorrect labeling and binning when frequencies cross DST boundaries.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to account for the potential shift in the day due to DST when calculating the time bins and labels. This may involve adjusting the bin edges and labels to align with the actual time intervals, considering any shifts caused by DST transitions.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that accounts for DST transitions:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]

    bins = []
    labels = []
    for start, end in zip(ax, ax[1:]):  # Iterate over start and end timestamps
        # Account for DST transitions
        if start.day != end.day:  # DST transition occurred within this pair of timestamps
            # Adjust the end time to align with the frequency
            end = start + self.freq
        bins.append(lib.Timestamp(start).value)
        labels.append(start)
    bins.append(lib.Timestamp(end).value)

    binner = DatetimeIndex(data=bins, freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
    labels = DatetimeIndex(data=labels, freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function takes into account potential DST transitions within the input `ax` and accounts for it when calculating the time bins and labels.

By addressing the potential shift in the day due to DST, this corrected version should pass the failing test case.
