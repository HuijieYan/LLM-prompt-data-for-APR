The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the pandas/core/resample.py is throwing a TypeError when it encounters a DatetimeIndex that is not empty. The bug seems to be related to the generation of time bins and labels.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the calculation of `binner` and `labels`, adjustment of bin edges, and the generation of bins using `generate_bins_dt64`.

The bug could be causing incorrect time bin generation, leading to mismatched bin and label counts, and potentially incorrect labels as compared to the bins.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the generation of time bins and labels is correctly aligned and that the bin and label counts match properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, has_nans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, adjustments have been made to ensure proper alignment of bins and labels, as well as handling of potential NaN values. This should address the bug and make the test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` pass.
