The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function inside the `TimeGrouper` class is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when working with time-interval grouping in the context of clock change days in Cuba. The issue is highlighted in the GitHub post, and it is related to the labeling of groups on ambiguous time stamps.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of ambiguous time stamps, specifically on clock change days. This can lead to the 'AmbiguousTimeError'. The labels and bins are not correctly adjusted to account for the ambiguous midnight timestamp during the clock change.

To fix this bug, a strategy would involve adjusting the labels and bins to properly handle ambiguous time stamps by explicitly handling the timestamp range that generates the ambiguous time and ensuring that the groups are labeled appropriately.

Given the information and the bug description provided, below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function inside the `TimeGrouper` class that resolves the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
  
    # Adjusting timestamps for ambiguous time during clock change day
    if last < ax.max():
        last += pd.Timedelta(1, 'D')

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that ambiguous timestamps are properly handled, and the labels and bins are adjusted to account for the clock change day in Cuba. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
