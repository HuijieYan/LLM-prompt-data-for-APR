The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class is causing a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to perform grouping on a daily frequency while handling ambiguous time stamps. The function fails to handle the daylight saving time transition appropriately, leading to an error in the downstream `groupby` operation.

The function attempts to create bins for the given axis, which is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`. It calculates the first and last timestamp and then constructs bins and labels using the `date_range` function. However, the approach to calculating these bins and labels does not account for the ambiguous times during daylight saving transitions, leading to the error observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the functionality of handling ambiguous times needs to be incorporated into the `_get_time_bins` function. This could involve checking for ambiguous times and adjusting the binning behavior accordingly. Additionally, the `date_range` parameters should be set to handle ambiguous and nonexistent times during daylight saving transitions.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='NaT',  # Handle ambiguous times as NaT
        nonexistent='shift_forward'  # Shift nonexistent times forward
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected implementation, the `_get_time_bins` function properly handles ambiguous and nonexistent times, ensuring that the groupby operation on a daily frequency with time zone transitions no longer leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
