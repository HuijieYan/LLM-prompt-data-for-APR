The bug in the provided code is related to handling ambiguous and nonexistent timestamps when creating bins for daily frequency data where clock changes occur. This bug causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using the `pd.Grouper` function for certain time zones with ambiguous timestamps.

The issue stems from `pd.Grouper` not properly handling ambiguous time on days that have a clock change, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data according to these daily frequency bins. This can be observed in the provided GitHub issue, where a test case for Cuba's clock change day resulted in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix this bug, a potential strategy would be to incorporate logic to handle ambiguous and nonexistent timestamps when creating the bins for the daily frequency. This could involve handling the ambiguous midnight timestamp as the first bin, taking into account the transition in time for the affected day. Additionally, the labels for the bins should reflect the actual timestamps, including the ambiguous and nonexistent timestamps, to ensure correct grouping.

Here's the corrected version of the code:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.floor('D').min(), ax.ceil('D').max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="min",  # Handle ambiguous times by taking the minimum
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Ensure correct labels for ambiguous and nonexistent timestamps
    for i, bin_val in enumerate(bin_edges):
        if i < len(labels) and labels[i] != bin_val:
            labels = labels.insert(i, bin_val)

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected version of the code, handling ambiguous and nonexistent timestamps have been incorporated into the logic for creating the bins. The `ambiguous` parameter is set to "min" to handle ambiguous times by taking the minimum value, and the labels are adjusted to reflect the actual timestamps, including the ambiguous and non-existent times. The correct logic for creating daily frequency bins with proper handling of ambiguous and nonexistent timestamps should address the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue highlighted in the GitHub case.
