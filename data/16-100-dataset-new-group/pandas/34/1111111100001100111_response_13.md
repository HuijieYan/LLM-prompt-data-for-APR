The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely causing the issue reported on GitHub. The problem arises when the `pd.Grouper` function is used with a daily frequency on a clock-change day in Cuba, resulting in ambiguous timestamps and an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This indicates a problem with creating the bins and labels for the grouped data.

The root cause is probably related to the handling of timestamps around the clock change day, leading to incorrect bin edges and labels. The issue with ambiguous timestamps needs to be addressed in order to generate the correct groups with the expected output.

A potential strategy for fixing this bug is to review the logic for creating the bin edges, labels, and bins on the clock-change day. It might involve verifying the handling of timestamps around daylight savings time transitions to ensure that ambiguous timestamps are correctly accounted for.

Given the information and context provided, a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function to address the bug is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Use NaT in ambiguous and nonexistent locations
    na_tz = NaT
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous=na_tz,
        nonexistent=na_tz,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes explicit handling of ambiguous and nonexistent timestamps by using `NaT` in the `date_range` generation, which addresses the issue of ambiguous timestamps and incorrect bin labels. This should resolve the bug and lead to correct grouping on clock-change days in Cuba.
