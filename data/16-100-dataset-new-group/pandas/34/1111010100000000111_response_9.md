The cause of the bug is related to a known issue with time grouping when using `pd.Grouper` and daily frequency on clock change days in certain timezones. The bug results in an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group data with daily frequency that includes ambiguous timestamps due to clock changes.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps caused by clock changes. Specifically, the function should be updated to handle situations where the start and end times are ambiguous due to the clock change in certain timezones.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        # Updated to handle ambiguous timestamps by using 'infer' for ambiguous argument
        if self.freq == 'D':  # Only applies for daily frequency
            binner = date_range(
                freq=self.freq,
                start=first,
                end=last,
                tz=ax.tz,
                name=ax.name,
                ambiguous="infer",  # Handles ambiguous times
                nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Handles non-existent times
            )
        else:  # For other frequencies
            binner = date_range(
                freq=self.freq,
                start=first,
                end=last,
                tz=ax.tz,
                name=ax.name,
            )
            
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # rest of the function remains the same
        # ...
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if the frequency is daily, and if so, it handles ambiguous timestamps by using the 'infer' argument for the ambiguous parameter when creating the binner. This strategy aligns with the approach described in the GitHub issue.

By implementing this fix, the `pd.Grouper` should be able to handle the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days in timezones like Cuba.
