The issue with the current `_get_time_bins` function is likely related to the handling of the timezone conversion and potentially the manipulation of the datetime indices. Given that the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` directly involves the tz_localize and tz_convert functions, the bug may be related to how the function handles timezone information during the binning process.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the timezone information is preserved and accurately handled during the binning process. This may involve making adjustments to how the start and end timestamps are calculated, as well as how the timezone information is passed to the `date_range` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function with added comments for clarity:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # Check if the input is a DatetimeIndex
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        # If the DatetimeIndex is empty, create empty bins
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the min and max timestamps in the DatetimeIndex
    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    # Construct the date range using the timezone information from the input DatetimeIndex
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Pass the timezone information from the input DatetimeIndex
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins using the appropriate function and handle the timezone information
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    # Adjust the labels based on closed and label settings
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If the number of labels exceeds the number of bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that the timezone information is accurately preserved and handled during the binning process, addressing the potential bugs related to timezones. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`.
