The buggy function is `_get_time_bins`. It is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the file `pandas/core/resample.py`. 

Based on the given runtime values and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug occurs when there is a long clock-change day in Cuba and a timestamp becomes ambiguous.

The bug occurs because the `binner` is being calculated using `date_range` with the `start` and `end` arguments. When an ambiguous timestamp arises, the `binner` is created with incorrect labels. This leads to the AmbiguousTimeError, causing the test to fail.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to handle ambiguous timestamps by using the `tz_localize` method before creating the `binner`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first.tz_localize(None),  # handle ambiguous timestamps 
        end=last.tz_localize(None),  # handle ambiguous timestamps
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected version, the `start` and `end` arguments in the `date_range` function are explicitly handled for ambiguous timestamps by using the `tz_localize` method, which should resolve the issue outlined in the GitHub report.
