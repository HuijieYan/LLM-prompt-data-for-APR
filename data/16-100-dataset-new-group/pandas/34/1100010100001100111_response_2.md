The issue described on GitHub is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days in Cuba when using the `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency. The example code provided in the issue raises an AmbiguousTimeError, and the expected output is to return three groups, one for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), with the group for the 4th of November labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and containing the 25 hourly data points for that day. The issue mentions that a similar nature issue was fixed in version 0.24, but not the one described.

Based on the runtime input/output values and the information from the GitHub issue, the bug is likely caused by the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days in the `pd.Grouper` function.

To fix the bug, we need to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, and ensure that the `pd.Grouper` function returns the expected groups for the specified frequency.

A corrected version of the function would be as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins, labels = pd.cut(ax, bins=bin_edges, right=False, include_lowest=True, labels=False, retbins=True)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version:
1. We handle the ambiguous timestamps using the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter in the `date_range` function.
2. We use the `pd.cut` function to generate the bins and labels, ensuring the correct handling of the ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days.

By making these changes, we can ensure that the `pd.Grouper` function handles ambiguous timestamps correctly and returns the expected groups for the specified frequency.
