The bug in the provided function is likely due to an issue with the calculation of the `bin_edges` and `bins` based on the `ax` parameter being a DatetimeIndex. The function is intended to compute time bins based on the DatetimeIndex values, but the computation seems to be incorrect in the buggy implementation.

The problematic part of the code seems to be in the calculation and adjustment of the `bin_edges` and `bins`. It appears that the calculations are incorrect, leading to unexpected output. The `date_range` function is used to calculate `binner` and `labels`, but the subsequent operations using these variables to calculate `bin_edges` and `bins` may be the cause of the bug.

Based on the given runtime values and the related code, we can suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. It seems that the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` is correct.
2. The bug may be occurring during the calculation and adjustment of `bin_edges` and `bins`.
3. To fix the bug, the calculation of `bin_edges` and `bins` based on the given frequency should be reviewed and adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    
    # Corrected the calculation and adjustment of bin_edges and bins
    bin_edges = np.concatenate((ax_values, [ax_values[-1] + 1]))
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the calculation and adjustment of `bin_edges` and `bins` have been redesigned to ensure they are based on the correct values and frequencies, providing an accurate representation of the time bins and labels.

This corrected version should address the bug and provide the expected output when used with the given runtime inputs and related code.
