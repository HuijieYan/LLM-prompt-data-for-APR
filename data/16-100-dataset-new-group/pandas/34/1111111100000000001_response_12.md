The potential error in the provided function is that it does not check for the 'ax' parameter to be a valid input before trying to access its properties. The function should verify that 'ax' is a DatetimeIndex before attempting to use its properties.

The fix for this bug is to add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that 'ax' is a DatetimeIndex. If it's not, the function should raise a TypeError. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    # Rest of the function body...
```

By taking this approach, the function will handle invalid inputs gracefully and provide a clear error message to the user, improving the robustness and usability of the function.
