## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], binner

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original code is related to the incorrect assignment of the `labels` variable and the complex logic around handling `NaN` values.
The `labels` variable was being assigned the same value as `binner` initially and then modified based on certain conditions, which leads to ambiguity and potential bugs. This could cause a problem when working with data that contains NaN values or when dealing with specific label configurations such as "right" labels. Additionally, unnecessary method calls and incorrect handling of the `labels` list have been identified as potential sources of error.

To fix the bug, the corrected version simplifies the handling of the `labels` variable and its modifications. It also addresses the incorrect assignment of variables and optimizes the logic for working with NaN values. Moreover, some unnecessary method calls have been removed to improve code readability and performance.

By making these changes, the corrected version aims to provide a more robust and reliable implementation of the `_get_time_bins` function.
