### Bug Explanation
The bug appears to be related to the handling of daylight saving time (DST) transitions during time grouping in the `pandas` library. Specifically, the bug occurs when groupby with daily frequency is used on a date that overlaps a DST transition in certain time zones, such as Cuba.

The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to infer the DST time, and the failing test case provides a specific example that triggers the bug: `datetime(2018, 11, 4, 0)` in the 'America/Havana' time zone. This error is raised during the execution of the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class.

The code is failing to handle the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the DST transition in Cuba, causing an incorrect `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the issue, the code must handle the ambiguous DST transition at midnight on the day of the clock change in the specified time zone. This might involve adjusting the logic for date range generation or handling time binning in a way that accommodates the ambiguous transition.

Additionally, the code may need to improve its handling of timestamp edges and associated indexes, ensuring that the behavior is consistent even across DST transitions.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range

# Corrected version of the _get_time_bins function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version adjusts the implementation of the `_get_time_bins` function to handle the DST transition at midnight on the day of the clock change in the specified time zone, ensuring compatibility with groupby operations on daily frequencies in such scenarios.
