The potential error locations within the `_get_time_bins` function are as follows:

1. The function might raise a `TypeError` if the input `ax` is not an instance of `DatetimeIndex`.
2. There could be an issue with the calculation of `first` and `last` using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function.
3. The adjustment of bin edges using `self._adjust_bin_edges` function could be problematic.

The cause of the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function could be due to improper handling of different timestamps and bin edges, leading to mismatched bins and labels. The function also lacks proper error handling for different input types.

To fix the bug, we should validate the input `ax` to ensure it is an instance of `DatetimeIndex` and handle the calculation of `first` and `last` properly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the adjustment of bin edges is performed accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1] + self.freq
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values, closed=self.closed)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, I have made changes to how `first` and `last` are calculated using the first and last elements of the `ax` array. I have also made adjustments to the `date_range` function call and passed the `closed` parameter explicitly. Additionally, I have assumed that the `_adjust_bin_edges` function has been updated to handle the `closed` parameter properly.
