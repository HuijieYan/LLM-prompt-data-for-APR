The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class causes the test failure because the function fails to handle the time zone transition correctly, leading to an ambiguous time error.

The buggy function fails to consider and handle the issue of ambiguous times, especially during time zone transitions. This results in the function creating bin labels that are ambiguous and lead to errors when performing resampling.

To fix the bug, the function needs to account for ambiguous times during the time zone transition and handle them appropriately during the binning process.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `date_range` function considers the `ambiguous` parameter set to "infer" to handle ambiguous times appropriately during the binning process. Additionally, the `tz` argument is preserved when creating the `binner` and `labels` to ensure the time zone information is retained throughout the process.

This should address the issue of ambiguous times during the time zone transition and prevent the ambiguous time error while performing resampling.
