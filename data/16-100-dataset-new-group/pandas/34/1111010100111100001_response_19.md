The bug appears to be related to the handling of Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions in the `TimeGrouper` class, specifically in the `_get_time_bins` method. The error message indicates an issue with inferring the DST time, and the runtime values show transitions between different time zones due to the DST.

The problem seems to be occurring when creating the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. The function is not handling the transition between the end of DST and the standard time correctly, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to infer the DST time.

To fix this bug, the `date_range` function call needs to handle the transition between DST and standard time properly. This could involve utilizing start and end dates that account for the time zone changes, and ensuring that the `ambiguous` parameter is appropriately set to handle ambiguous times during a DST transition.

The corrected version of `_get_time_bins` is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]
    
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `date_range` function starts at the first timestamp and ends at the last timestamp in the `DatetimeIndex`, ensuring that it accounts for any DST transitions. The `ambiguous` parameter is set to "infer" to handle ambiguous times during DST transitions.

This should resolve the issue with inferring the DST time and prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.
