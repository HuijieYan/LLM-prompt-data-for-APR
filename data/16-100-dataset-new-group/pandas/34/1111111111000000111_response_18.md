The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is failing to handle the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba. The issue arises from conversion of timestamp into daily frequency which results in the mislabeling of timegroups due to the ambiguous timestamps.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the AmbiguousTimeError properly and ensure that the group labels are correctly assigned.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    closed = "left" if self.closed == "left" else "right"
    
    # Use the first and last day as the start and end
    first = ax.min().normalize()
    last = ax.max().normalize() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)

    # Generate date range from start to end based on frequency
    bin_edges = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, closed=closed)

    # Remove the ambiguous times by normalization and removing duplicates
    binner = ax.normalize().drop_duplicates().reindex(bin_edges, method=closed).dropna()

    if len(binner) == 0:
        labels = binner
        bins = binner
    else:
        labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=binner[0],
            end=binner[-1] + pd.Timedelta(days=1),
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        # Replace binner with labels
        binner = labels

        # Generate bins using the new labels without any ambiguous times
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, labels.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we adjust the bin edges by using the normalize method to remove the ambiguous times and then compute the bins and labels accordingly. This fix should resolve the issue described in the GitHub issue.
