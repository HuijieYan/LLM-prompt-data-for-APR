### Analysis:
The buggy function '_get_time_bins' appears to be attempting to create time bins for a given DatetimeIndex. The function seems to be using the 'date_range' function to create the bins based on the frequency provided.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of 'date_range' to create the bins might be causing the bug.
2. The adjustment of bin edges using '_adjust_bin_edges' might not be functioning correctly.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug in the '_get_time_bins' function might be causing the incorrect creation of time bins and labels, which leads to the failing test 'test_downsample_dst_at_midnight'. Specifically, the incorrect creation of time bins could result in an incorrect calculation of the mean when grouping by the daily frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the usage of 'date_range' to ensure it's correctly creating the time bins.
2. Check the '_adjust_bin_edges' function to ensure it's adjusting the bin edges accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Start from the first actual timestamp instead of relying on 'ax.min()'
    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1] + self.freq
    if self.base is not None:
        first = self.base.apply(first)
        last = self.base.apply(last)

    # Create bins and labels using DatetimeIndex
    binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
    bins = binner.asi8
    labels = np.array([Timestamp(val, freq=self.freq) for val in bins])
    bins = lib.generate_bins(np.asarray(ax), np.asarray(bins, dtype="M8[ns]"), closed=self.closed, right=self.closed == "right")
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making the above changes to the '_get_time_bins' function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass.
