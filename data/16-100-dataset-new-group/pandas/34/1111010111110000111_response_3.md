The provided buggy function is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins based on the provided DatetimeIndex.

The error reported in the failing test is an `AmbiguousTimeError` raised when trying to groupby with daily frequency on a clock change day in a specific timezone. The function is not handling the ambiguous timestamp correctly, leading to this error.

The cause of the bug and the failing test is that when using the `pd.Grouper(freq="1D")` with a datetime index that has an ambiguous time (due to a clock change), the `Grouper` fails to create the bins correctly, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This is reported as GitHub Issue #25758.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should take into account the timezone and handle ambiguous times correctly. It should also ensure that the bins are created without causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping by a daily frequency. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use the `tz_localize` method to handle ambiguous times due to a clock change
    ax = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous='NaT')

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by using the `tz_localize` method to handle ambiguous times due to a clock change. It ensures that the bins are correctly created without causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping by a daily frequency. This should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
