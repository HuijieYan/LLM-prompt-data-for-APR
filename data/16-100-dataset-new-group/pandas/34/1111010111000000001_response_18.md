The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The calculation of first and last timestamps using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function.
2. The adjustment of bin edges using `_adjust_bin_edges` function.
3. The generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` function.
4. The adjustment of labels if the length of bins is less than the length of labels.

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` seems to have an issue with properly defining the time bins and labels, which is causing the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the time bins and labels are not being generated correctly for downsampling the datetime index, leading to incorrect results when grouping the data.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing the code for generating time bins and labels, ensuring that the datetime index is properly handled, and identifying and correcting any potential issues in the specific steps mentioned above.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max() + self.freq
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, closed=self.closed, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By ensuring the correct calculation of the first and last timestamps, adjusting the bin edges, generating bins, and adjusting labels, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
