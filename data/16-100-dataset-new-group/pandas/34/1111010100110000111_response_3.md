### Analysis
The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is being raised while executing the test case. The datetime conversion for the time zone "America/Havana" on November 4th is causing the issue. The issue on GitHub explains that the call to `groupby` is not handling the ambiguous timestamp correctly.

The error is being generated in the `date_range` function within the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error locations within the `_get_time_bins` method include:
1. Incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `date_range` function, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
2. Incorrect label generation for the groupby operation.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `date_range` function, which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The issue arises from the conversion of timestamps in the time zone "America/Havana" where there are no repeated times, causing the ambiguity.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by adjusting the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `date_range` function and ensuring correct label generation for the groupby operation based on the provided information.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()  # Use the original first and last timestamps
        binner = date_range(
            start=first,
            end=last,
            periods=round((last - first) / pd.Timedelta(self.freq)) + 1,
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        return binner, [], binner  # Return the corrected binner for the groupby operation
```

The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method makes use of the correct timestamps `first` and `last` while creating the `date_range`. It also returns the correct `binner` for the groupby operation, bypassing the issue of ambiguous timestamps.
