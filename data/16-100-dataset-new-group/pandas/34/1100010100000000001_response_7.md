## Potential Error Locations
1. The function makes use of `_get_timestamp_range_edges` which is not defined in the given code.
2. There is a possibility of an error in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function, as it is being called but not defined in the given code.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug might be caused by the undefined functions `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges`. Additionally, there might be potential issues related to the comparison between the length of `bins` and `labels`, as they are being adjusted based on each other's length.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Define the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` functions, or provide an appropriate alternative for them.
2. Check the conditions for the comparison between the length of `bins` and `labels`, and ensure that the adjustment is correct.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/resample.py

from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT, Timestamp
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min() - pd.Timedelta(self.freq)
    last = ax.max()

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version:
1. `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function was replaced by direct calculations of `first` and `last` based on `ax.min()` and `ax.max()`.
2. The adjustment of `labels` based on the comparison with `bins` was retained, as it seems to be appropriate for the context.
