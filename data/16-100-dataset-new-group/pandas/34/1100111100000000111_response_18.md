The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days, as described in the GitHub issue. By using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on a long clock-change day in Cuba, an AmbiguousTimeError is raised.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps that occur during a clock change in the `date_range` function call, which is used to generate the bins. Additionally, the adjustment of labels and bins based on relative frequencies is not properly handled.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly and adjust the labels and bins appropriately based on the unique requirements of handling daily frequency on a clock-change day.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly
    ambiguous_handling = "shift_forward" if self.closed == "left" else "shift_backward"

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax[0],
        end=ax[-1] + Period(self.freq),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous=ambiguous_handling,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8

    # Adjust the bins based on the unique requirements of handling daily frequency on a clock-change day
    if self.freq == "D":
        bin_edges = np.array(ax_values)
    else:
        bin_edges = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, ax_values, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bin_edges) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bin_edges)]

    return binner, bin_edges, labels
```

In the corrected version, the ambiguous timestamps are handled explicitly using the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function call. Additionally, the adjustment of bins and labels is based on the unique requirements of handling daily frequency on a clock-change day.

This corrected version should resolve the issue with daily frequency failing on clock-change days and the AmbiguousTimeError as described in the GitHub issue.
