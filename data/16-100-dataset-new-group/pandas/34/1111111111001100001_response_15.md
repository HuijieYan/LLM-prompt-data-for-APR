The bug in the provided function `_get_time_bins` seems to be occurring due to an issue with the time zone conversion and the label generation. It seems that the function is not correctly dealing with time zone differences and daylights saving time (DST) adjustments.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the time zone conversions and DST adjustments are being handled correctly, and the labels are generated appropriately for the given time zone.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Localize the DatetimeIndex to the time zone associated with the TimeGrouper
    ax_localized = ax.tz_convert(self.freq.tz)

    # Use the localized DatetimeIndex for calculating first and last
    first = ax_localized.min()
    last = ax_localized.max()

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax_localized.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function takes into account the time zone of the provided input `DatetimeIndex`, localizes it to match the time zone associated with the `TimeGrouper`, and then uses the localized index for further calculations.

By using the localized `DatetimeIndex`, we ensure that any DST adjustments and time zone differences are handled correctly. This should address the issue with incorrect labels and adjustments for DST transitions.

After applying this fix, the provided failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should pass without errors.
