### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous time on clock change days in the `pandas.core.resample._get_time_bins` function. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised when calling `groupby` in the failing test.

The failing test uses `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')` to group the data by day, but on a clock change day in Cuba, e.g., on 2018-11-04, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. When groupby is called in the failing test, it raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`, which prevents the test from passing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle ambiguous time on clock change days in the `pandas.core.resample._get_time_bins` function. Specifically, we should adjust the behavior when creating bins and labels to account for ambiguous times. 

We can achieve this by using a method that handles ambiguous times effectively and doesn't raise an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we handle ambiguous times by setting the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function to "infer". This change ensures that ambiguous times are handled effectively, and the `AmbiguousTimeError` is not raised on clock change days. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and enable the failing test to pass.
