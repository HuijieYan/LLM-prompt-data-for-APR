Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to how the `date_range` is being created and adjusted to handle the transition from a Daylight Saving Time (DST) to a Standard Time (ST). 

The issue likely lies in how the `date_range` is being created using the `start` and `end` parameters. The `start` and `end` parameters are being calculated based on the `first` and `last` timestamp values. However, because the transition from DST to ST causes the time to shift by an hour, the `date_range` is not correctly capturing this transition, resulting in bins and labels that do not align with the actual time interval.

To fix the bug, the `date_range` should be adjusted to handle the transition from DST to ST more accurately. This can be achieved by explicitly specifying the timezone when creating the `start` and `end` parameters for the `date_range`, and then using the `tz_convert` method to handle the transition.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    # Adjust start and end timestamps for DST transition
    start = ax.min().tz_localize(None).tz_convert(ax.tz)
    end = ax.max().tz_localize(None).tz_convert(ax.tz)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=start, end=end, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this fix, the `date_range` is adjusted to handle the transition from DST to ST by explicitly converting the start and end timestamps using the timezone information from the input `DatetimeIndex`.

This should address the bug and ensure that the time bins and labels are correctly aligned with the actual time intervals, allowing the failing test to pass.
