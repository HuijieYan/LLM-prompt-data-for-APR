## Analysis:
1. The function is designed to get time bins based on the input axis (ax).
2. The function checks if the input axis is of type DatetimeIndex and raises a TypeError if not.
3. It then proceeds to calculate the time bins based on the input axis and some frequency parameters.
4. The function also performs some adjustments on the bin edges and labels based on certain conditions.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculation of time bins may result in incorrect values if the edge cases are not handled properly.
2. The adjustments to bin edges and labels may not be accurate.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug may be caused by inaccurate calculation of time bins and misalignment of bin edges and labels, leading to incorrect time binning.

## Suggested Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Check the calculation of time bins and ensure it handles edge cases correctly.
2. Verify the adjustments to bin edges and labels based on different conditions to ensure accuracy.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        binner = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(binner):
        binner = binner[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, binner
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments to bin edges and labels have been reviewed and modified to ensure accurate time binning. Additionally, the handling of edge cases has been revised to address potential inaccuracies.
