The bug is likely in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class. The error message `Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times` indicates that there's an issue with daylight saving time handling when resampling time series data.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the handling of timezone information during the resampling process, which leads to an ambiguous time error. Since the error is related to daylight saving time and timezone conversions, the bug is likely related to how the time bins are constructed and labeled, potentially not accounting for the possibility of ambiguous times during the adjustment of time bins.

To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made to the creation and labeling of time bins, specifically accounting for ambiguous times that may occur during the process of converting the time index to a different timezone.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Properly handle timezone during date_range creation
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Ensure that timezone information is preserved
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='infer',  # Automatically infer ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # You can keep the rest of the original code as it is
    # ...
```

By making sure to preserve and handle timezone information correctly when creating the time bins and accounting for ambiguous times during this process, the bug related to daylight saving time should be resolved. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test scenario.
