The bug in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class arises from the fact that the `date_range` function is returning the wrong bin edges and labels due to an issue with handling ambiguous time during a clock change day in Cuba. The GitHub issue #23742 confirms that this bug has been previously flagged and is expected to be fixed. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function handles ambiguous times correctly, specifically by providing the correct frequency for the time zone. This will result in the correct bins and labels being generated.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize()

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last + pd.Timedelta(days=1),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        periods=len(ax) + 1,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we've utilized the `normalize()` method to ensure that the first and last timestamps fall on midnight, which helps in handling ambiguous times during a clock change day. We've also adjusted the `date_range` function to generate the correct bin edges and labels, accounting for the time zone frequency.

By making these changes, the issue with handling ambiguous time during a clock change day in Cuba will be resolved, and the `_get_time_bins` method will produce the expected output for the given GitHub issue.
