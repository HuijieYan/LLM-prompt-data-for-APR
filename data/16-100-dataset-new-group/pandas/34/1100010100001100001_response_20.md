The bug in the function seems to be related to the generation of the `labels` variable, which is being used to create the `binner` and `bins` variables. The issue is causing discrepancies between the length of the `binner` and `bins` arrays.

The current strategy employed by the function is to create the `labels` based on the frequency and range of the input `DatetimeIndex`, and then align the `binner` and `bins` arrays with the `labels` to ensure consistency.

However, due to the difference in time zones and frequencies, the length of the `labels` array is not being correctly aligned with the `bins` array, leading to an error.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the way in which the `labels` array is generated and subsequently aligned with `binner` and `bins`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the function generates the `binner` using `date_range` directly, rather than reusing the `labels` variable. This ensures that the length and content of the `binner` and `labels` arrays remain consistent.

It also adjusts the length of the `labels` array to match the length of the `bins` array, thereby resolving the discrepancies that were causing the bug.
