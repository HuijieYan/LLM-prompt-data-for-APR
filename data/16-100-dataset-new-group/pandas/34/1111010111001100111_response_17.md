The bug in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class is causing issues with groupby on a long clock-change day in Cuba, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This occurs when midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, causing the call to `groupby` to fail to handle it properly.

The bug seems to stem from the handling of the timestamp range edges, particularly when the clock change affects the binning process. This is evident in the runtime values of the input parameters and the variables right before the buggy function's return.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of the timestamp range edges, particularly in cases when the clock change affects the binning process, is correctly performed to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring. This might involve adjusting the method by considering the potential for ambiguous timestamps, especially when transitioning between time zones or during daylight saving time changes.

In light of this analysis, here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(
            data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name
        )
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to the handling of timestamp range edges by considering and appropriately addressing the potential for ambiguous timestamps, especially when transitioning between time zones or during daylight saving time changes. This should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring in cases like the one described in the GitHub issue.
