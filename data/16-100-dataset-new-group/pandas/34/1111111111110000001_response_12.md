Looking at the provided bug and the related functions and test code, the `_get_time_bins` function is raising a `TypeError` when the input `ax` parameter is not an instance of `DatetimeIndex`. Additionally, the failing test is related to a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` raised when the code attempts to handle daylight saving time. This indicates that there is an issue with the time handling in the code.

The bug is likely caused by the `_get_time_bins` function not properly handling time zone localization, which results in the ambiguous time error. The error message shows that the ambiguous time error is raised from the `tz_localize_to_utc` function, which is likely called during the process of creating a date range.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the time zone localization is handled properly throughout the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class. This may include adjusting the time zone properties and applying the appropriate conversions when working with time-related calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        ax = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_convert("UTC")  # Assuming default timezone if not already localized
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Process with the assumption that the ax is in the UTC timezone
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Preserve the timezone
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that any input `ax` that is not already a localized `DatetimeIndex` is converted to UTC timezone before processing. This ensures consistent handling of time zones throughout the function. By preserving the timezone information during the date range creation, the ambiguity error should be resolved.

This correction should address the bug and allow the provided test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to pass without raising a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError`.
