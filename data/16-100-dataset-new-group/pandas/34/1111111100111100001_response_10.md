The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function appears to be related to the handling of time zone changes across midnight. The function seems to incorrectly handle the transition from one time zone offset to another, resulting in an ambiguous time error.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the transition from daylight saving time to standard time correctly when generating the bins, labels, and edges for the resampling process. This results in an ambiguous time error due to the mismatch in time zone offsets for the same local time.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly handle the transition from one time zone offset to another by ensuring that the time zone is correctly adjusted when generating the bins and labels for resampling. Additionally, the function should properly handle ambiguous times that may occur during the transition.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the first and last timestamps from the DatetimeIndex
    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    # Convert the first and last timestamps to a common time zone
    first = first.tz_convert("UTC")
    last = last.tz_convert("UTC")

    # Generate bins and labels using the common time zone
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz="UTC",
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Convert the bins and labels back to the original time zone
    binner = binner.tz_convert(ax.tz)
    labels = labels.tz_convert(ax.tz)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version of the function, we ensure that the first and last timestamps are converted to a common time zone (in this case, UTC) before generating the bins and labels. After the bins and labels are generated, we convert them back to the original time zone to preserve the local time representation. This approach should resolve the ambiguous time error that occurs due to the transition from daylight saving time to standard time.
