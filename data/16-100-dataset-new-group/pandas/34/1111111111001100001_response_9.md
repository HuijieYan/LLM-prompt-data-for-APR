The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of time zone localization and conversion. It is causing the bins and labels to be created incorrectly.

The bug appears to be in the line where the `binner` and `labels` are created using the `date_range` function. This line is using `start` and `end` directly from `first` and `last` without considering the actual time zone conversion that needs to be applied.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the time zone conversion is correctly applied to `first` and `last` before using them to create `binner` and `labels`.

## Corrected Version

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Apply time zone conversion to first and last
    first = ax.min().tz_localize(None).tz_localize(self.freq.start, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    last = ax.max().tz_localize(None).tz_localize(self.freq.end, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax, first, last)
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same
    ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we apply time zone conversion to `first` and `last` using the `tz_localize` method before creating `binner` and `labels`. This should address the bug related to time zone localization and conversion and ensure that the bins and labels are created correctly, fixing the failing test.
