The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the dataframe with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. The bug is a result of a timezone-related issue. When creating the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, the bug incorrectly handles the ambiguous time due to the clock change.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the creation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function to properly handle the ambiguous time caused by the clock change when converting the timezone. Additionally, careful handling of the time bordering the clock change is needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Generate an array of unique values from the DatetimeIndex
    ax_values = ax.unique().values
    # Retrieve the first and last timestamps from the unique values
    if self.closed == 'right':
        first = ax_values[0]
        last = ax_values[-1] + self.freq
    else:
        first = ax_values[0] - self.freq
        last = ax_values[-1]

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='infer',
        nonexistent='shift_forward'
    )

    # Generate bins based on the frequency
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values.view('i8'), binner.values.view('i8'), self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Explanation:
- In the corrected version, unique values are generated from `ax` using the `ax.unique().values` method to ensure that there are no duplicate ambiguous times due to the clock change in Cuba.
- The first and last timestamps are computed based on the unique values, adjusted to account for the closed interval, i.e., adding/subtracting the `self.freq` to the last/first timestamp when the interval is closed on the right.
- The `date_range` function is then used to create `binner` and `labels` based on the computed first and last timestamps, and the frequency, taking into account the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters for proper handling of ambiguous times due to the clock change.
- The bins are then generated based on these computed values.

After making these changes, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should now handle the ambiguous time caused by the clock change on a day in Cuba, and the `AmbiguousTimeError` should no longer occur when grouping the dataframe with a daily frequency.
