The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely due to the mismatch between the length of the `labels` and `bins`. The function seems to be failing to handle the different frequency offsets within the input `ax`. The `ax` contains timestamps with different frequency offsets as well as a mixed timezone value which appears to be impacting the generation of `binner`, `labels`, and `bins`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function is handling the generation of `binner`, `labels`, and `bins` to ensure they are correctly aligned and cover the entire input `ax`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the range of timestamps in the same timezone
    common_time_zone = ax.tz_localize(None)
    first = common_time_zone.normalize(ax.min())
    last = common_time_zone.normalize(ax.max()) + self.freq

    # Generate bins and labels based on the common time zone
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=common_time_zone, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    labels = binner[1:]

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the timestamps in the input `ax` are normalized to a common timezone before generating the `binner` and `labels`. This should help align the bins and labels correctly. Additionally, we have modified the calculation of `last` to ensure that all timestamps in `ax` are covered within the time range.

This fix should address the mismatch in length between `labels` and `bins` as well as handle the mixed timezone values in the input `ax`.
