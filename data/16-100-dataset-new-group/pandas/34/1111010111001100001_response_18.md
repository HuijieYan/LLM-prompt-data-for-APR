The bug appears to be related to the handling of different time zones in the DatetimeIndex.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the conversion of time zones and the changes due to Daylight Saving Time. This is evident from the fact that the buggy function fails in a test scenario where the time zone is converted. The function is not correctly adjusting for the change in the number of hours in the day due to the transition to or from Daylight Saving Time, which leads to incorrect bin boundaries and labels.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the time zone conversion and the transition to or from Daylight Saving Time when determining bin boundaries and labels.

The corrected version of the function should handle the time zone conversion and Daylight Saving Time transition by adjusting the bin boundaries and labels accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], binner

    ax_tz = ax.tz_convert(self.freq)
    ax_values = ax_tz.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax_tz)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version takes into account the time zone conversion and Daylight Saving Time transition by converting the input DatetimeIndex to the desired frequency before calculating bin boundaries and labels. It then adjusts the bin edges and labels accordingly to handle the changes due to the time zone conversion and transition between standard and daylight time.
