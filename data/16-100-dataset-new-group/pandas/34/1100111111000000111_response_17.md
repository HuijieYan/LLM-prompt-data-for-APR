The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is trying to create time bins and labels based on a given `DatetimeIndex` `ax`. The bug seems to result from the handling of ambiguous time in the `DatetimeIndex` when using `pd.Grouper` for grouping `DatetimeIndex` objects.

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` provides a specific scenario where the bug occurs. The test attempts to downsample data based on daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba, which causes ambiguous timestamps.

The GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba" provides details about how the bug affects the `pd.Grouper` function. It highlights that the call to groupby in the provided code raises an AmbiguousTimeError when encountering timestamps that are ambiguous due to the clock change.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that the call to groupby does not raise an AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner, bins = ax.to_period(self.freq, 'start'), []
    while len(bins) < len(binner):
        end = binner[len(bins)]
        bins.append(ax[(ax >= end.to_timestamp()) & (ax < end.to_timestamp() + self.freq)])
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        bins = bins[:-1]
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner[:-1]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version uses the `to_period` method to handle ambiguous timestamps and create time bins and labels accurately, resolving the issue with AmbiguousTimeError.
