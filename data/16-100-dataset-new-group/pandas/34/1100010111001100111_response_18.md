The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function causes issues with handling ambiguous time during groupby operations, as described in the GitHub issue. The bug leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the incorrect labeling of the group for the day of the clock change in Cuba.

The potential error locations are:
1. Incorrect handling of the first and last timestamps when creating the time bins.
2. Inaccurate adjustment of bin edges based on the specified frequency.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect generation of time bins and labels, especially when handling ambiguous time. This results in an incorrect grouping of the data and leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to improve the logic for generating time bins and labels, taking into account the potential presence of ambiguous times in the localized time zone. Special consideration should be given to the day of the clock change.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize() + Timedelta(days=1)  # Adjust for last bin on clock change day

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with handling the first and last timestamps, adjusts the bin edges to account for the day of the clock change, and properly generates time bins and labels to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
