The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class expects an input parameter `ax` of type `DatetimeIndex` and generates `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` as the output. The function seems to handle time interval grouping, and the expected outcome based on the failing test is incorrect. 

The issue appears to be with the computation of `first`, `last`, `binner`, `labels`, `ax_values`, `bin_edges`, and `bins`. The calculations involving timestamp range edges and date ranges may be incorrect, leading to incorrect binning and labeling of the time intervals.

The potential cause of the incorrect outcome is the computation involving timezone, timestamp range, and bin edges. By using the `date_range` function, a mismatch in timezone or incorrect computation of start and end timestamps could lead to incorrect bin edges and intervals.

To fix the bug, it's essential to ensure that the timestamp range edges and bin edges are accurately calculated, considering the timezone and possible daylight saving time changes.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor('D')
    last = ax[-1].ceil('D')

    # Ensure that the timezone is considered in the date range generation
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected version, the computation of `first` and `last` is revised to ensure that the timezone is considered in the date range generation. This will address the potential issues related to timezone and daylight saving time changes that may have caused the bug.
