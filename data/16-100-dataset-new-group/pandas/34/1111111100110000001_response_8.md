The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class and is called to group a DataFrame by a specified time interval. The error message indicates an issue with ambiguous time during the time range creation, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The problem seems to occur when handling date ranges with timezone conversions.

The bug likely arises from the `date_range` function being called within the `_get_time_bins` method. The `date_range` function attempts to create a date range based on the frequency, start, and end points provided. Given the error message's context, it appears that there is an issue with ambiguous time when creating this date range due to timezone conversions.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that proper handling of timezone localization and ambiguous time is carried out when generating the date range.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Construct date range with proper timezone handling and ambiguous time resolution
    binner = date_range(
        start=first.tz_convert(ax.tz),  # Handle timezone conversion
        end=last.tz_convert(ax.tz),  # Handle timezone conversion
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Infer ambiguous time
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Resolve non-existent time
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the date range construction is modified to ensure proper handling of timezone conversion, ambiguous time resolution, and non-existent time resolution. This should resolve the issue related to ambiguous time during the time range creation, thereby fixing the bug.
