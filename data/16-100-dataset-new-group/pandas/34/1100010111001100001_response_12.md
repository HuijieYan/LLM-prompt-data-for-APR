The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely caused by incorrect binning labels and the adjustment of bin edges. 

Given the runtime values and types of input parameters and variables at the return, it can be observed that the binning labels (`binner`, `labels`) and bin edges (`bin_edges`) are not consistent with the expected behavior of the function, particularly when dealing with time zone shifts and adjustment of bin edges.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve:
1. Handling time zone shifts correctly in the binning process.
2. Adjusting bin edges based on the specified frequency and time zone.
3. Ensuring that the labels and bins align correctly based on the actual data and frequency.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Handling time zone shifts correctly
    start = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    end = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)

    # Generating binner and labels based on the specified frequency and time zone
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Adjusting bin edges
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generating bins based on adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjusting labels based on the closed and label parameters
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjusting labels if more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, adjustments to time zone shifts, bin edges, and labels are handled more accurately, which should ensure correct binning and labeling based on the specified frequency and time zone.
