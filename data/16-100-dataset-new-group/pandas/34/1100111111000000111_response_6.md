The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function causes an AmbiguousTimeError when grouping time data with a daily frequency on a clock change day in a specific timezone. The bug is caused by the inability of the Grouper to handle ambiguous times, such as midnight on a clock change day. This leads to unexpected behavior and an error when trying to group the data.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to handle the ambiguous times, particularly when generating the time bins for the groupings. This can be done by updating the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times, taking into account the timezone and daylight saving time changes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()  # normalize to handle ambiguous times
    last = ax[-1].normalize()  # normalize to handle ambiguous times

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `first` and `last` timestamps are normalized to handle ambiguous times. This ensures that the time bins are generated correctly, taking into account any ambiguous times that may exist due to daylight saving time changes.

With these updates, the `_get_time_bins` function should now correctly handle grouping time data with a daily frequency on clock change days, resolving the AmbiguousTimeError as described in the GitHub issue.
