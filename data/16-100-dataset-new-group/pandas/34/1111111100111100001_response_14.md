The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is due to the use of the `date_range` function to generate bins and labels. This leads to an error related to ambiguous time when using the `pd.Grouper` function. The discrepancy in the time intervals causes the `date_range` function to produce incorrect results, leading to the error. 

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to accurately generate the time bins and labels using a different approach.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max()
    
        bins = [
            first + i * self.freq for i 
            in range(int((last - first) / self.freq) + 1)
        ]
        labels = bins[:-1]
    
        return bins, bins, labels
```

This corrected version directly calculates the bins and labels without using the `date_range` function. This will avoid the potential error related to ambiguous time and ensure the correct generation of bins and labels.

By using this corrected version, the failing test should pass without any errors related to ambiguous time.
