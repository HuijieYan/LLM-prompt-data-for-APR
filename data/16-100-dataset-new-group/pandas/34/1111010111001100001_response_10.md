The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function appears to be related to the incorrect generation of bin edges and labels. The code is failing due to incorrect handling of datetime data when creating bins and labels.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of time zone information during the creation of bins and labels, specifically when the transition from standard time to daylight saving time occurs. This causes a mismatch between the number of bins and labels, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the code should handle the transition between standard time and daylight saving time properly and ensure that the number of bins and labels matches the input `DatetimeIndex` in all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize() + self.freq

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Adjust bin edges and handle time zone transitions
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax)

    # Generate bins based on adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on closed and label options
    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # Insert NaNs if necessary
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Ensure the number of labels matches the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the handling of time zone transitions, adjusts bin edges appropriately, and ensures that the number of labels matches the number of bins. After applying this fix, the failing test should pass successfully.
