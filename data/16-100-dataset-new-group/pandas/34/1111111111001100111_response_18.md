To fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function, we can modify the calculations of the `first` and `last` timestamps to handle the ambiguous timestamps that occur during the daylight saving time change in Cuba. We can achieve this by adjusting the start and end points to avoid the ambiguous time error.

Based on the input parameters and the failing test, the issue is related to an ambiguous time error on the clock change day in Cuba. This error occurs when trying to group data using `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency. The failing test, `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, is triggered by undefined behavior on long clock-change days when local time is ambiguous.

To resolve the issue:

1. The calculation for the `first` and `last` timestamps should be closely examined to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly.
2. The `date_range` call to define the bin edges and labels should use proper start and end points to avoid using ambiguous timestamps.
3. Handling of the daylight saving time change in Cuba should be included in the calculation of bin edges and labels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    tz_aware_index = ax.tz_localize(None)  # Remove tz localization

    # Adjust the start and end points to avoid ambiguous time error
    start = tz_aware_index[0].normalize()  
    end = tz_aware_index[-1].normalize() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)  # Include the entire last day

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=start,
        end=end,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this modified `_get_time_bins` function, the `start` and `end` points for the `date_range` are adjusted to avoid the ambiguous time error, considering the daylight saving time change in Cuba. Additionally, the `tz_aware_index` is localized to remove any timezone information before performing the adjustment on the start and end points.

With these adjustments, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly, resolving the issue reported in GitHub and passing the failing test.
