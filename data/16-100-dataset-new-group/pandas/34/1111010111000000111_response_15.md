First, let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the `TimeGrouper` class, the failing test, and the GitHub issue.

### Bug Analysis
The function `_get_time_bins` is within the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is related to the issue reported on GitHub about the groupby with daily frequency failing with an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The function might not be handling ambiguous timestamps correctly on the clock change day in Cuba.
2. There might be an issue with the calculation of bins and labels for the given time frequency.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps, especially when generating bins and labels for the time intervals. This leads to failing the specific test case for the clock change day in Cuba.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the function `_get_time_bins` handles ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially in scenarios involving clock changes. Additionally, the generation of bins and labels should be reviewed to address any specific discrepancies related to the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the analysis, here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _get_time_bins function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Calculate bins and labels using the time frequency and considering ambiguous time
    frequency = self.freq
    if frequency in ['D', 'B']:
        binner, labels = _daily_bins_labels(ax, frequency, self.closed)
    else:
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses potential issues with the handling of ambiguous timestamps and also considers specific scenarios like clock changes, which are relevant to the failing test case in the GitHub issue.

By ensuring proper handling of ambiguous timestamps and specific scenarios for time intervals, the corrected function is expected to pass the failing test scenario and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
