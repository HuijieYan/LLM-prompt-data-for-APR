## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in Pandas. The function takes a `DatetimeIndex` as input and performs operations to determine the time bins.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the calculations for `first` and `last`, the adjustment of bin edges, and the generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect calculation of `first` and `last`, which may result in improper binning and mismatched labels. This could lead to unexpected behavior when downsampling time series data, as shown in the failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the calculation of `first` and `last` is correct and preserves the nanosecond part to avoid errors when creating bins and labels.
2. Review the adjustment of bin edges to ensure it properly aligns with the time intervals and does not lead to mismatched bins and labels.
3. Verify the generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` to guarantee the proper allocation of data points into the correct bins.

With these considerations in mind, the following is a corrected version of the buggy function:

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    frequency = self.freq
    offset = self.closed
    tz = ax.tz
    
    binner = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=frequency, closed=offset, tz=tz, name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the calculation of `first` and `last` is simplified, and the `date_range` function is used to directly create the binner with appropriate frequency, closed end, and time zone information. The adjustment of bin edges and the generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` remain unchanged. This corrected version should pass the failing test while correctly handling the time intervals for binning.
