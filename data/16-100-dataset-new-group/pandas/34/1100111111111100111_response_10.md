Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, it seems that the bug is related to handling ambiguous time on clock change days in Cuba. The failing test specifically mentions an `AmbiguousTimeError` at midnight local time on such days. Therefore, the bug is likely occurring due to an issue with handling the transition in time zones, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class should be modified to handle ambiguous times on clock change days properly.

Here's an updated and corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner if self.label == "left" else binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `first` and `last` are directly used without calling `replace()` on them to handle the nanosecond part, addressing the specific issue mentioned in the failing test and the GitHub issue. Additionally, the `tz` parameter is passed explicitly when creating the `binner` to ensure time zone information is retained correctly.

With these modifications, the updated `_get_time_bins` function should properly handle ambiguous times on clock change days, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread and passing the failing test.
