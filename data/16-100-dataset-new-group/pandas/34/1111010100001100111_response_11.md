## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class, within the pandas library. The issue is specific to handling time intervals on days with clock changes and ambiguous times.

The inputs to the function include a `DatetimeIndex` (`ax`), a frequency (`self.freq`), and other parameters related to time interval grouping. The function returns `binner`, `bins`, and `labels`, which represent the time bins, bin edges, and the labels for the time intervals, respectively.

In the GitHub issue, it's mentioned that on a long clock-change day in Cuba (e.g., 2018-11-04 in this case), midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. As a result, the function should handle this ambiguity and properly label the time intervals.

The function fails to handle this situation, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. It fails to account for the ambiguity in time and does not properly adjust the bin edges, leading to incorrect grouping and labeling.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function needs to check for ambiguous time situations, adjust the bin edges accordingly, and label the time intervals correctly.

We'll need to use the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to handle ambiguous times, update the bin edges based on the presence of ambiguous times, and ensure that the labels are adjusted accordingly. Additionally, we need to consider proper handling of the time zone information and the possible shift in time due to the clock change.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Ensure time zone information is preserved
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by replacing with NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Shift times that do not exist forward
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Adjusting for ambiguous times and time zone changes
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we have made adjustments to handle ambiguous times, preserve time zone information, and ensure that the labels and bins are adjusted correctly, taking into account the potential shift in time due to the clock change. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
