To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function creates the expected timestamps, including any ambiguous time caused by daylight saving time transitions. 

The bug is likely caused by an issue with how the `date_range` function constructs the timestamps, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data. 

To fix the bug, we need to handle the ambiguous time caused by the clock change day in Cuba. We can achieve this by adjusting the way the timestamps are created to account for the ambiguous time.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Calculate the first and last timestamps without using `date_range`
    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize() + self.freq

    # Create the binner and labels directly, considering ambiguous time
    binner = labels = date_range(start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer")

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of ambiguous time, ensuring that the `date_range` function creates the timestamps correctly, accounting for the time transition on the clock change day. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data.

Make sure to test this corrected version to verify that the bug has been fixed.
