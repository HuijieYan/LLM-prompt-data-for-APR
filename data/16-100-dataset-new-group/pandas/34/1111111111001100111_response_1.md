The bug is occurring in the `_get_time_bins` function inside the `TimeGrouper` class. The issue seems to be related to how pandas handles the transition to and from daylight saving time, particularly on days with a time change event such as in the provided test case from Cuba.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle the transition to and from daylight saving time correctly, leading to ambiguous timestamps and a subsequent `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to correctly account for the transition to and from daylight saving time. One potential strategy to fix the bug is to utilize the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters when creating the date range to properly address ambiguous times or non-existing times.

Now, here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function based on the discussed issue and potential solution:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust time based on ambiguous and nonexistent times
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use the ambiguous and nonexistent parameters to account for daylight saving time transition
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these changes, the corrected function should properly handle the transition to and from daylight saving time, resolving the issue and the failing test case.
