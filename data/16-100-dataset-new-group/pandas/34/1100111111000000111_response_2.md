The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is designed to handle time binning within the `TimeGrouper` class. The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous time on clock change days, specifically in Cuba. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` highlights this issue by demonstrating that the groupby operation fails to handle ambiguous time correctly, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The cause of the bug lies in the logic for handling daylight saving time (DST) on clock change days, where midnight local time is ambiguous. The `_get_time_bins` function does not handle this case correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling time bins on clock change days needs to be modified to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps when transitioning between standard time and DST.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Handle ambiguous time on clock change days
    start = ax.min()
    end = ax.max()
    first = start if not start.tzinfo._utc_transition_times else start.replace(fold=0)
    last = end if not end.tzinfo._utc_transition_times else end.replace(fold=1)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the logic remains unchanged
    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By modifying the logic to handle ambiguous time correctly using the fold attribute on clock change days, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
