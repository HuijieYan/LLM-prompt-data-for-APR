The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group data for a specific frequency in the presence of a clock change day. The bug appears to be related to the handling of daylight saving time in the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` operations for the `DatetimeIndex`.

The cause of the bug is that the timestamp range computed using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function does not correctly handle ambiguous times during daylight saving transitions. This leads to an inconsistent labeling of bins and ambiguity in the resulting time intervals.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the timestamp range computed does not lead to ambiguous time errors. One approach to this fix is to explicitly handle ambiguous times during the computation of the timestamp range.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    # Ensure that the timestamp range is computed without ambiguity
    first = ax.min().tz_localize(None)
    last = ax.max().tz_localize(None) + self.freq

    binner, labels, bin_edges = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed, label=self.label, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    return binner, bin_edges, labels
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the `first` and `last` timestamps are computed without ambiguous time by removing the timezone information before the computation and reapplying it afterward. This adjustment should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError issue and provide consistent labeling for the resulting time intervals. This fix addresses the problem reported in the GitHub issue and should resolve the failing test case.
