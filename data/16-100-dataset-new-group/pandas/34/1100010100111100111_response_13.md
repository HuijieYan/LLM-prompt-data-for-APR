The bug in the provided function is related to the handling of daylight saving time (DST) transitions in certain time zones, such as the America/Havana time zone in Cuba. The function is intended to divide a dataframe into groups based on a specified frequency, but it fails to handle ambiguous timestamps that occur during the transition from Standard Time to Daylight Saving Time. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_time_bins` attempts to create bin labels and bin edges based on the frequency and timestamps, without considering the potential ambiguity of timestamps due to DST transitions. This leads to incorrect bin labels and edges, causing the subsequent generation of bins to fail when dealing with ambiguous timestamps.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle ambiguous timestamps that arise during DST transitions. This involves adjusting the generation of bin labels, bin edges, and the subsequent bin formation to account for ambiguous timestamps. One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to use the `reindex` method to handle the ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that the bin labels and edges are correctly aligned with the timestamps, thus preventing the AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # handle ambiguous time during DST transitions
    labels = binner.reindex(ax, method='ffill')
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version incorporates the use of the `reindex` method to handle ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that bin labels and edges are aligned with the timestamps. This change should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError reported in the GitHub issue while handling DST transitions correctly.
