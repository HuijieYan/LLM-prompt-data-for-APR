Based on the bug description and the failing test, it seems that the issue occurs when trying to group data over a period that includes an ambiguous time due to a Daylight Saving Time (DST) transition in a specific time zone, such as the one in Cuba. The error message points to an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to infer the DST time.

The bug is likely caused by the `_get_time_bins` function failing to handle ambiguous times resulting from time zone conversions, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The function is unable to handle the label assignment for the ambiguous time.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be updated to handle ambiguous times and label assignment correctly. Specifically, when performing the date range, the function should account for ambiguous times and label them appropriately in the resulting bins.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner, labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:].copy()
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:].copy()

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated version of the `_get_time_bins` function changes the label assignment to correctly handle ambiguous times and uses the `copy` method to prevent modifying the original labels. With these changes, the function should now correctly handle time bins with ambiguous times and resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
