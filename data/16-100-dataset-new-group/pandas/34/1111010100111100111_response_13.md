The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the handling of ambiguous time stamps, specifically those occurring on clock change days, which is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test. The issue is specifically related to the call to `date_range` with ambiguous timestamps caused by the daylight saving time (DST) transition in Cuba.

The cause of the bug is related to the calculation of the timestamp range, as well as the creation of `binner`, `labels`, and `bins` arrays. The existing code does not handle the situation where midnight local time is ambiguous due to the clock change, causing the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, the code should handle the ambiguous time stamps by making adjustments to the way the timestamp range is calculated and the labels are created. The call to `date_range` should be modified to handle ambiguous times during the transition.

Given the above, below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer"  # Handle ambiguous times during the transition
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these changes, the function should handle the ambiguous time stamps correctly and avoid the AmbiguousTimeError for cases where midnight local time is ambiguous due to the clock change.
