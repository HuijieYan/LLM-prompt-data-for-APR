To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_time_bins` function to address the issue described in the GitHub post. The problem arises from the fact that the function incorrectly handles the transition between standard time and daylight saving time on ambiguous days due to a clock change. 

To resolve the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly process ambiguous time stamps and handle dates on clock change days in a way that the ambiguous hourly data points for these days are not mishandled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version of the function has been updated to handle ambiguous time stamps correctly. It should now be able to process the ambiguous hourly data points on clock change days without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`. By addressing this issue, the corrected function should meet the expectation described in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test scenario.

If you would like to include other helper functions or context to complete the fix, please provide additional details, as necessary.
