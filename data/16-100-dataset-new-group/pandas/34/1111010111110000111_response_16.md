The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function attempts to set time bins for use in resampling, but it encounters an error when an ambiguous timestamp is encountered due to a clock change.

Based on the failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` and the corresponding error message, the issue occurs when the `groupby` method is called on a DataFrame after setting a `pd.Grouper` frequency with daily ("1D") intervals for resampling. Specifically, the error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data by day on the clock change day in Cuba.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class does not handle ambiguous timestamps, which causes the resampling operation to fail when an ambiguous timestamp is encountered on the day of the clock change.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should be updated to handle ambiguous timestamps more effectively. This may involve modifying the logic for creating time bins, handling time zone changes, and addressing ambiguous timestamps that occur during the resampling process.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use .tz_localize(tz) to handle ambiguous times
    ax = ax.tz_localize(self.freq.tz) if self.freq is not None else ax
    # The rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected function, the `tz_localize` method is used to handle ambiguous times, and the logic for creating time bins is preserved. This correction should address the issue related to the AmbiguousTimeError and resolve the bug.
