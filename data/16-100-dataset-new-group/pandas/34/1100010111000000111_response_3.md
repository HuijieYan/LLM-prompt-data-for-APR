Here are the steps to fix the bug:

1. Analyze the issue: The issue is related to the `pd.Grouper` function not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, specifically on a clock-change day in Cuba. The failing test is a clear example of this issue, as it fails to group the data correctly based on the timezone localization and the ambiguous time at midnight.

2. Identify potential error locations: The `_get_time_bins` function is directly responsible for generating the bins and labels for the grouping, which could be the source of the bug.

3. Explain the cause of the bug: The bug seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `pd.Grouper` function, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This is likely due to the incorrect handling of timezone localization and ambiguous times at midnight on clock-change days.

4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug: The fix would involve correctly handling ambiguous timestamps and timezone localization within the `_get_time_bins` function to ensure that the grouping using `pd.Grouper` works as expected, even on clock-change days with ambiguous times.

Based on this analysis, here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import should_cache
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import Grouper
from pandas.core.resample import _get_timestamp_range_edges

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = Grouper(key='name', label='right', closed=self.closed, base=self.base)._get_time_bins(ax)
   
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version uses the `Grouper` class to handle the time bins, labels, and grouping, ensuring that the timezone localization and handling of ambiguous times are taken care of correctly. This should address the issue and make the failing test pass.
