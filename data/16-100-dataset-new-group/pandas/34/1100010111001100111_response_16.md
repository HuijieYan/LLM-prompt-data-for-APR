The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the file `pandas/core/resample.py` needs to be fixed. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the AmbiguousTimeError, particularly on the clock change day in Cuba. This results in an incorrect grouping of the data, causing the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to fail.

The buggy function does not handle the ambiguous timestamp occurring at midnight on the day of the clock change in Cuba. This results in incorrect labeling of the bins, and the groupby operation does not return the expected output.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_time_bins` needs to handle the AmbiguousTimeError caused by the clock change day in Cuba. The `DatetimeIndex` may contain an ambiguous time, and the code should be modified to handle this situation by ensuring that the bin labels are correctly assigned and the grouping is done appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Fix for handling AmbiguousTimeError
    if ax[0].strftime('%H:%M') == '00:00' and ax[0].tzinfo._dst and ax[0].tzinfo._isdst:
        first += pd.Timedelta(1, unit='h')

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The correction handles the AmbiguousTimeError by adding a timedelta of 1 hour to the `first` timestamp if it is ambiguous and falls on the clock change day. With this change, the function should handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly, resulting in the correct grouping of the data.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should pass, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
