The cause of the bug is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock change days in certain timezones, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError. This is not handled as expected, resulting in incorrect grouping.

To fix this bug, we need to address how the ambiguous timestamps are handled and ensure that the grouping is done correctly, taking into account the timezone changes.

Here's the corrected version of the function incorporating the necessary changes:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed  # Pass the closed argument to date_range
    )

    # Handle the ambiguous timestamps
    # The ambiguous argument here will handle ambiguous values, defaulting to 'raise'
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax, ambiguous='raise')

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we modify the call to `date_range` by passing the `closed` argument to it and handle the ambiguous timestamps by passing the `'raise'` parameter to `_adjust_bin_edges` function, which was added as a new parameter to handle the ambiguous timestamps.

This should address the issue described in the GitHub report related to ambiguous timestamps and the incorrect grouping on clock-change days in certain timezones.
