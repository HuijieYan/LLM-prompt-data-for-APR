The bug in the function `_get_time_bins(self, ax)` is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group data with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. The issue is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on days with daylight saving time changes. This causes the `date_range` function to raise an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to infer the DST time.

The bug is likely due to the `date_range` function's behavior when dealing with ambiguous timestamps on days where the local time undergoes a DST change. The `date_range` call is not handling the ambiguous timestamps correctly, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the `date_range` call to be more robust in handling ambiguous timestamps, especially on days with DST changes. Additionally, the handling of labels and bins could be improved to ensure that the grouping operation does not raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    resampler = ax.resample(self.freq)
    binner = resampler.first().asfreq(self.freq)
    bins = [b.right for b in resampler]
    labels = bins[:-1]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version handles the grouping operation using `resample` to handle ambiguous timestamps and ensure correct labeling. It also returns the appropriate `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError` on days with DST changes.
