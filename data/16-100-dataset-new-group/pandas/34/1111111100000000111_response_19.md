### Analysis:
The reported issue is related to the handling of ambiguous time stamps on clock change days, specifically in the context of grouping data by a daily frequency. The `pd.Grouper` function is expected to handle this situation and create groups for each day without raising an AmbiguousTimeError.

### Potential Error Locations:
The bug could be located in the `_get_time_bins` function, especially in the generation of bins and labels using the `date_range` function. The handling of ambiguous time stamps and the adjustment of labels according to the specific frequency need to be addressed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the inconsistent handling of ambiguous time stamps and the adjustment of labels on clock change days. The `date_range` method might not be accommodating the specific needs for grouping data on clock change days, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The fix should involve a thorough review of the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function. It should include proper handling of ambiguous time stamps on clock change days, revisiting the `date_range` usage, and ensuring proper adjustment of labels according to the time frequency.

### Bug Fix:
Based on the analysis and bug fix strategy, the corrected version of the code is provided below:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust the labels according to the size of bins
    labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected version addresses the potential issues and is expected to resolve the AmbiguousTimeError reported in the GitHub issue.
