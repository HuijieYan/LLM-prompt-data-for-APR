Issues in the code:
- The bug is likely in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class within the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.
- The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps when applying the `pd.Grouper` to the data with a daily frequency in the presence of time zone localization.

Explanations:
- The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` creates a dataframe with a date range that includes a date with ambiguous timestamps due to a time zone change. The expected behavior is to handle these ambiguous timestamps correctly, but the current implementation might be failing to do so.
- The GitHub issue is related to a similar problem where pandas didn't handle ambiguous time stamps correctly, and it is expected to have been fixed in version 0.24.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- The bug could be related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating bin edges for the `1D` frequency in the presence of time zone localization. It might be necessary to handle these ambiguous timestamps explicitly to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
- Additionally, it is essential to ensure that the label for the group corresponding to the ambiguous timestamp is as expected.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    labels = binner
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1, freq=self.freq)
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In this corrected version, we handle the ambiguous timestamps explicitly by using the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter when creating `binner`. We also correctly handle the labels for bins corresponding to the "right" convention.

This corrected version of `_get_time_bins` aims to address the issue at hand and should pass the failing test while resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
