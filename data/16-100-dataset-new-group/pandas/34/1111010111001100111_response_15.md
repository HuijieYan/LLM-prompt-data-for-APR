The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library is related to a failure when the clock changes due to daylight saving time, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

The cause of this bug is that the function does not handle the ambiguous timestamp for the midnight local time on a clock-change day, resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError. This leads to incorrect binning and labeling for the affected day.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the ambiguous timestamps that occur on clock-change days due to daylight saving time.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()  # Use the normalized first timestamp
    last = ax[-1]  # Simply use the last timestamp

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]  # Adjust labels for "right" closed interval
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the key changes include using the normalized first timestamp and directly using the last timestamp. Additionally, the labels are adjusted for "right" closed interval, and the function properly handles any potential NaN values. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
