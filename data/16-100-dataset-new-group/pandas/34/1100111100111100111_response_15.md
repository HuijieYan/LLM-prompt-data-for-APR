To fix the bug, we need to handle the ambiguous timestamp in the Cuba time zone on the clock change day. The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the ambiguous time and raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the dates.

The current implementation of the `_get_time_bins` function does not handle the ambiguous timestamp caused by the clock change on the day of the test case. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the timestamp range calculation and binning process consider the ambiguity on the clock change day.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    if ax.tz._ambiguous_time:
        # Handle the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day
        first = ax[0].tz_convert(None)
        last = ax[-1].tz_convert(None)
    else:
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we added a check for `ax.tz._ambiguous_time` to handle the ambiguous timestamp caused by the clock change. If the timestamp is ambiguous, we convert the timestamps to a non-timezone-aware representation to avoid ambiguity and properly calculate the `first` and `last` timestamps. This change ensures that the function can handle the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day in the given timezone.

With these modifications, the corrected function should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the AmbiguousTimeError on the clock change day in the Cuba time zone.
