The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing the failing test. The error message indicates a problem with inferring dst time, suggesting a problem with timezone conversions.

The potential error locations in the function are near the computation of `binner`, `labels`, `first`, and `last`. These variables are used to compute the `bin_edges` and `bins`, which ultimately lead to the ambiguous time error.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the timezone conversion in the `date_range` function, as well as the usage of `ax.tz`. It seems that the timezone conversion is not being handled correctly, leading to the ambiguous time error.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the timezone conversion and usage of `ax.tz` are handled properly. This may involve adjusting the way timezone information is propagated through the computations, as well as using the appropriate methods for timezone handling in the `date_range` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)  # Ensure timezone is propagated correctly
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version:
1. Ensure that timezone information is propagated correctly through the computations.
2. Use the `ax.tz` information directly in the `date_range` function.
3. Remove the unnecessary conversion of `first` and `last` using `_get_timestamp_range_edges`.

By making these changes, the function should now handle timezone-related computations correctly and avoid the ambiguous time error.
