The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` is likely caused by the incorrect usage of `date_range` to generate `binner` and `labels`. This mistake results in the misalignment of the bin edges and labels, leading to incorrect bins being generated.

In order to fix the bug, we need to use the correct method to generate `binner` and `labels` so that they align with the bin edges and the expected bins are generated accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        # Use the bin edges directly without relying on date_range for binner and labels
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax, ax_values)
        
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `date_range` has been removed from the `_get_time_bins` function. Instead, it directly uses `_adjust_bin_edges` to get `binner` and `bin_edges` aligned properly, and generates the bins accordingly. This ensures that the labels and bins are correctly aligned without any issues.
