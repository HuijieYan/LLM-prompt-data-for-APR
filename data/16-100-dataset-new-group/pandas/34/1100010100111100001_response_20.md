The bug in the given function causes an AmbiguousTimeError due to the use of `date_range`, which cannot handle ambiguous times resulting from daylight saving time (DST) changes. The error is due to the fact that `date_range` does not handle ambiguous times well, leading to an error message that it "Cannot infer dst time from [specific time] as there are no repeated times".

To fix the bug, the use of `date_range` needs to be replaced with a method that can handle ambiguous times. One way to address this is by converting the DatetimeIndex to a timezone-aware series and use resampling to calculate the mean. This approach uses the `resample` method to handle DST transitions correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    tz_aware_ax = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_localize('UTC').tz_convert(ax.tz)

    resampled = self.groupby.resample(freq=self.freq, axis=0, closed=self.closed, label=self.label, loffset="0ms").mean()
    binner = labels = resampled.index.get_level_values(0)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `tz_aware_ax` is calculated by removing any timezone information from the original `ax` and then converting it to UTC timezone, followed by reconciliation with the original timezone. The `resample` method is used on the `groupby` object to create a resampled version which can handle DST transitions. This approach avoids the use of `date_range` and resolves the AmbiguousTimeError.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test without encountering the AmbiguousTimeError.
