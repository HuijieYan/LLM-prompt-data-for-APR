The bug seems to be occurring in the function `_get_time_bins` when trying to adjust the bin edges using the function `_adjust_bin_edges`. 

In the provided runtime values, the `bin_edges` variable has incorrect values, as it seems that the bin edges are not properly adjusted based on the input `ax_values`. This affects the subsequent calculations and leads to incorrect `binner` and `labels` as well as the `bins` variable.

To fix this bug, the `_adjust_bin_edges` function needs to be reviewed and corrected to properly adjust the bin edges based on the input `ax_values`. Once the bin edges are correctly adjusted, the subsequent calculations should yield the correct values for `binner`, `labels`, and `bins`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Adjust the bin edges based on the input ax_values
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax.asi8)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment of bin edges is properly carried out within the `_get_time_bins` function. The adjusted bin edges are then used for the subsequent calculations to get the correct values for `binner`, `labels`, and `bins`.
