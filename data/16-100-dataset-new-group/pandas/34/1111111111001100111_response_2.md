Based on the input parameters, the issue description, and the runtime values of relevant variables, it seems that the current implementation of the `_get_time_bins` function fails to account for the ambiguity in timestamp on the day of the clock change in Cuba. This results in the incorrect labeling of the group for the 4th of November, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError. There are a few steps required to correct the bug.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Lack of handling the ambiguous timestamps during the clock change in Cuba
2. Incorrect calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps
3. Insufficient adjustment of the bin edges in relation to timestamp ambiguity

### Explanation of Bug Cause:
The issue arises due to the failure to handle the ambiguous timestamps effectively in the context of a clock change. The code related to the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps and the adjustment of bin edges does not adequately account for the ambiguity, leading to incorrect binning and labeling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Implement handling of ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba by considering the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters during the timestamp adjustment process.
2. Correctly calculate the `first` and `last` timestamps while accounting for the ambiguous time.
3. Ensure that the bin edges are appropriately adjusted to handle ambiguity.

### Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function, the erroneous handling of ambiguous timestamps has been addressed. Additionally, the adjustment of bin edges now accounts for ambiguity and adjusting the timestamps correctly along with updating the bin generation logic.

By implementing these corrections, the issue related to groupby with daily frequency failing with AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba should be resolved, and the provided failing test should pass.
