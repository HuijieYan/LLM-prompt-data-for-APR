The bug in the _get_time_bins function seems to be related to the handling of timezone conversions and the frequency of the datetime index. When the function is called with the provided input, it fails to correctly create the bins and labels due to the timezone differences and frequency mismatches.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the creation of bins and labels to handle timezone conversions correctly and ensure that the frequency is consistent with the input. We can also revise the logic to handle the generation of bins and labels based on relative frequencies.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_time_bins function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().normalize()
    last = ax.max().normalize()

    binner, labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = DatetimeIndex([NaT]).append(binner)
        labels = DatetimeIndex([NaT]).append(labels)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we use the normalize() method to adjust the first and last timestamps to match the frequency. We also adjust the creation of labels and bins to account for the timezone and frequency differences. Additionally, we handle the insertion of NaT values for missing data in a more robust manner.

With these adjustments, the _get_time_bins function should now correctly handle the input and pass the failing test case provided.
