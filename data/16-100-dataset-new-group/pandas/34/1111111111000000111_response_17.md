## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The problem might be in the calculation of the `first` and `last` variables within the `_get_time_bins` function, leading to incorrect bin edges.
2. There could be an issue in handling the ambiguous timestamp during the groupby operation due to the time change in the timezone, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Cause of the bug using the information from the function, class, related functions, test code, and GitHub Issue
The bug occurs because the `_get_time_bins` function does not handle the daylight saving time (DST) transition correctly when applying the `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')` to the datetime index with time zone conversion. This leads to an AmbiguousTimeError, as reported in the GitHub issue. The issue seems to be related to the calculation of bin edges when the time transition occurs.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be updated to handle the ambiguous timestamp during the daylight saving time transition. Additionally, adjustments should be made to the calculation of bin edges to ensure correct labeling and grouping in the presence of ambiguous time.

## Corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
      
    first = ax[0].to_period(self.freq).start_time
    last = ax[-1].to_period(self.freq).end_time
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        periods=len(ax),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function handles the ambiguous timestamp during the daylight saving time transition. It calculates the `first` and `last` bin edges with consideration of the DST transition. Additionally, it adjusts the bin edges and labels appropriately to handle the ambiguous time and resolve the grouping issue identified in the GitHub report.
