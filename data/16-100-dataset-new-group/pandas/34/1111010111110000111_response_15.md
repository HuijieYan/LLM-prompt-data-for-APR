To fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class, we need to address the issue where an AmbiguousTimeError is raised due to an ambiguous timestamp on a long clock-change day in Cuba. The code tries to group the data by day using the `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')`, but it fails when encountering timestamps affected by the clock change in Cuba.

One potential source of the bug is that the code does not handle ambiguous timestamps properly when grouping the data. This leads to an AmbiguousTimeError being raised, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` method to properly handle ambiguous times, ensuring that the grouping operation takes the ambiguous timestamps into account and does not raise errors.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=ax.min(),
            end=ax.max(),
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_time_bins` method should handle the ambiguous timestamps properly, preventing the AmbiguousTimeError from being raised and ensuring that the grouping operation works as expected.
