The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is due to incorrect handling of the transition period during daylight saving time (DST), resulting in the incorrect binning of timestamps. The incorrect handling of timestamps, especially during the transition from standard time to DST (e.g., 01:00 to 02:00), causes the bins to be represented incorrectly, resulting in the failing test case.

The strategy to fix the bug is to handle the transition period during DST properly by adjusting the bin edges to account for the change in time. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the labels and bins are generated correctly for different scenarios, including the transition periods.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor("D")
    last = ax.max().ceil("D") + pd.Timedelta(days=1)

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version ensures that the bin edges are properly adjusted, taking into account the transition periods during DST. Additionally, it ensures that labels and bins are generated correctly for all scenarios. This should address the bug and make the failing test case pass.
