## Identifying the potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to time binning and label generation, which may cause issues on clock change days in certain time zones, such as the AmbiguousTimeError reported on the GitHub issue.

## Explaining the cause of the bug:
The bug likely originates from the time binning methodology used in the `_get_time_bins` function, which may not be handling ambiguous timestamps correctly for certain time zones. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that the script does not directly address days with ambiguous time changes such as the long clock change day in Cuba mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
To resolve the bug, the time binning and label generation logic in the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be adjusted to handle ambiguous time stamps and time zone changes correctly, especially for long clock change days. This may involve considering the specific time zone rules for handling ambiguous times and adjusting the binning and label generation process accordingly.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    # Adjust the time bins and bin-edges to handle ambiguous time stamps and time zone changes correctly
    # Strategy: Use the `ambiguity` parameter to handle ambiguous time stamps
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values, ambiguity='shift_forward')

    # Use the appropriate parameters to handle ambiguous time stamps and time zone changes
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans, ambiguous='shift_forward'
    )

    # Adjust label generation to handle ambiguous time stamps and time zone changes correctly
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version provided above, adjustments have been made to handle ambiguous time stamps and time zone changes correctly using the `ambiguous` parameter, particularly in the `_adjust_bin_edges` and label generation steps. This corrected version aims to address the root cause of the bug by ensuring that time binning and label generation are handled in a manner that accommodates ambiguous time stamps and time zone changes.
