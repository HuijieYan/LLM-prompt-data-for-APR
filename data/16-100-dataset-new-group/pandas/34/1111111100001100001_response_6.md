The bug in the provided function is likely due to an issue when adjusting the time bins and labels. The implementation currently attempts to perform adjustments that may be unnecessary, resulting in incorrect outputs. Additionally, the bug might be related to inappropriate treatment of time zone information, leading to discrepancies in time intervals and labels.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for adjusting time bins and labels and ensure proper handling of time zone information. Specifically, we should make adjustments based on the frequency and time zone of the input DatetimeIndex `ax` while generating the bins and labels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().round(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().round(self.freq) + self.freq
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed)
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Use the cut function for generating bins based on the adjusted bin edges
    bins = pd.cut(ax_values, bins=bin_edges, labels=False, right=self.closed == "right")

    labels = binner[: len(bins)]
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, adjustments to the time bins and labels are made based on the input frequency and the time zone information contained in the input `DatetimeIndex` `ax`. Additionally, the `cut` function is used to generate the bins based on the adjusted bin edges, which ensures more accurate labeling.

By making these adjustments, the bug in the original function can be fixed, and the correct time bins and labels will be produced.
