Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, the bug seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous time on a clock-change day in Cuba.

The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class. The issue seems to be related to the handling of timestamps around the clock-change day in Cuba.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling ambiguous time on clock-change days. We can use the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to handle this.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # ... (existing code)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # ... (existing code)
```

In this corrected version, we have added the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter to the `date_range` function call to handle ambiguous times. This should resolve the issue related to the clock-change day in Cuba and pass the failing test.
