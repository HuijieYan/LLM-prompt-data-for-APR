The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the failure to handle ambiguous times properly, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping with a daily frequency that includes a clock change day in Cuba.

The issue is further described in the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba". The issue identifies that on a long clock change day in Cuba, such as 2018-11-04, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. The `pd.Grouper` does not handle this as expected, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to group by and causing incorrect group labels.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of timestamp range edges in the `binner` and `labels`. Additionally, the `date_range` is not taking into account the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters correctly, leading to the error.

A potential strategy to fix the bug would be to handle the ambiguous times explicitly in the `_get_time_bins` function by checking for ambiguous times within the timestamp range and appropriately handling the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters in the `date_range` function to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `ambiguous` parameter is set to "NaT" to handle ambiguous times by replacing them with 'Not-a-Time' (NaT) values, thus avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError`. Additionally, the `nonexistent` parameter is set to "shift_forward" to handle non-existent times by shifting them forward and ensuring correct labeling of the bins.
