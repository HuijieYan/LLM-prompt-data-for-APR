To fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function, it is important to address the AmbiguousTimeError that arises due to the daily frequency grouping on clock change days in Cuba. The error occurs because the code does not handle ambiguous timestamps associated with the clock change.

The `date_range` function is currently being used to generate time bins, and it doesn't handle ambiguous times occurring during daylight saving time transitions. As a result, the labels for the groups are incorrect, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug:
- Utilize the `resample` function within Pandas, specifically the `DatetimeIndex.resample` method, to handle the time binning for grouping on the specified frequency while accounting for ambiguous timestamps.
- Pass the `how` parameter to specify the aggregation function to be applied to each group, in this case, using `mean` as in the failing testcase.

The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = ax.resample(self.freq).asfreq()
    bins = ax.groupby(binner.asof).agg('size').values

    # handle the case when labels are not a multiple of bins
    if len(bins) < len(binner):
        labels = binner.unique()[:len(bins)]
    else:
        labels = binner.unique()

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By applying the `resample` method and handling ambiguous times appropriately, the corrected function should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and produce the expected output, thereby passing the failing test and addressing the GitHub issue.
