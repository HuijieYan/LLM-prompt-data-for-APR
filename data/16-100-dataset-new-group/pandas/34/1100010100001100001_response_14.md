The bug in the provided function appears to be in the `_adjust_bin_edges` method since the `binner` and `labels` are of type `DatetimeIndex` but they do not match the expected output. The issue seems to be related to the calculation of `bin_edges` and the subsequent adjustment of `bins`. Therefore, to fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of `bin_edges` and adjustment of `bins` align with the input parameters and the expected output.

There are also some discrepancies between the expected and actual values for `bin_edges`, `bins`, `binner`, and `labels`. These discrepancies indicate that the calculations for these variables are incorrect or need adjustment. 

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for calculating `bin_edges` and `bins`, especially in relation to the `freq`, `closed`, `label`, and `hasnans` parameters and ensure that they are aligned with the input parameters and the expected output. Additionally, we need to ensure that the labels and bins are being adjusted correctly based on the length of the bins.

Here is a corrected version of the function with the suggested adjustments:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we have adjusted the calculations for `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `bins` based on the input parameters and adjusted the labels based on the length of the bins. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output.
