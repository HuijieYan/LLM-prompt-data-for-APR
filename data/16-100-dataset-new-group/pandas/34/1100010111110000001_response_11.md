The issue here is that the `_get_time_bins` function, which is a part of the Pandas package, is causing the "AmbiguousTimeError" in the test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight()` in the file `test_datetime_index.py`.

The "AmbiguousTimeError" occurs when there are no repeated times when performing operations on time indexes, and it is happening on the line involving the Grouper, which is related to the time binning logic in the `_get_time_bins` function. This is a result of the incorrect binning process in the `_get_time_bins` function.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should be modified to properly handle datetime indexing and binning. Specifically, the frequency and time zone information should be included in the binning process to avoid potential AmbiguousTimeErrors.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    min_time = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    max_time = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)

    if self.closed == "left":
        # Shift the min_time one step as the left-most bin edge is exclusive
        min_time -= self.freq
    elif self.closed == "right":
        # Shift the max_time one step as the right-most bin edge is inclusive
        max_time += self.freq

    binner = date_range(
        start=min_time,
        end=max_time,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the logic for determining the bin edges (min_time and max_time) has been improved to properly handle the closed intervals and take into account the frequency and timezone information. This should ensure that the time binning is done correctly, avoiding the AmbiguousTimeError.

When the corrected version is used, it should pass the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`.
