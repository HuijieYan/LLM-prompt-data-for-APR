The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely related to the way it handles the transition from standard time to daylight saving time, which occurs on the day the time changes in Cuba. This transition results in an ambiguous timestamp at midnight on that day, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to group the data.

The cause of the bug appears to be the incorrect handling of the daylight saving time transition in the `date_range` call, which does not account for the ambiguity in the timezone data. This leads to inconsistencies in binning the data and eventually results in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to properly handle the ambiguous time. This can be achieved by refining the logic used to calculate the bin edges and labels, ensuring that daylight saving time transitions are correctly accounted for.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Create an array of timestamps for each day in the range
    # Considering the timezone and daylight saving time
    timestamps = [
        pd.Timestamp(d, tz=ax.tz) for d in ax.strftime('%Y-%m-%d').unique()
    ]

    # Generate the bin edges and labels using the array of timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=timestamps[0],
        end=timestamps[-1] + pd.Timedelta(days=1),  # Ensure the end time is after the last day
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = binner.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, `timestamps` is created to account for the ambiguous time caused by the daylight saving time transition. Then, these timestamps are used to define the range for `date_range`, ensuring that it correctly handles the transition and avoids the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

With this corrected version, the `_get_time_bins` function should be able to handle the ambiguous time issue and avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError` when used with the given test case.
