The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is causing an issue when trying to group data using `pd.Grouper`. The groupby operation fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError` for the specific test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` due to a problem with time zone localization and daylight saving time. The root cause of the bug is that the `_get_time_bins` function incorrectly adjusts time bins based on the input timestamps when resampling. This incorrect adjustment leads to the AmbiguousTimeError when working with time series data.

To fix this bug, you should avoid adjusting time bins and instead rely on the functions provided by the Pandas library for handling date range and resampling. 

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    bins = date_range(start=ax.min(), end=ax.max(), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)

    return bins, bins, bins
```

In this corrected version, the time bins are directly calculated using the `date_range` function, avoiding any manual adjustments or replacements. This should fix the bug and help the function pass the failing test.
