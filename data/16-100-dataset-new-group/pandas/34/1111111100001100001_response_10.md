The bug seems to be occurring when calculating the bin edges and labels within the `_get_time_bins` function. The issue seems to be associated with the frequency of the time bins, resulting in incorrect bin and label values. The source of the problem may be due to the use of the `tz` attribute of the input `ax` to control the timezone. This could be causing inconsistencies when creating the binner and label values.

One strategy to fix the bug is to remove the `tz` attribute from the `ax` object to ensure consistency across the calculation of bin edges and labels. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the computations of the `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `labels` to ensure that they match the timezone and frequency requirements.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the potential bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Remove the tz attribute from ax to ensure consistency
    ax = ax.tz_localize(None)

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By removing the `tz` attribute and handling the timezone consistency within the function, the corrected version aims to address the potential bug related to the calculation of bin edges and labels. This should ensure that the computation of bins and labels aligns with the frequency and timezone requirements, potentially resolving the issue.
