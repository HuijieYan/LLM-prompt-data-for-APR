The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely related to the `date_range` function and the handling of the `ax_values` variable. The function is intended to generate time bins, but it appears that there are issues with creating the bins and adjusting the labels based on the input `ax` of type `DatetimeIndex`.

The bug is caused by the mismatch between the intended functionality and the actual implementation, leading to incorrect binning and labeling of time intervals.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the generation of time bins and accurately adjust the labels based on the input `ax`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bin_edges = (binner - (binner[1] - binner[0]) / 2).values
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right":
        bins = bins[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment of time bins and labels is properly handled, and the `date_range` function is used with the correct parameters to generate the desired time intervals. The bin edges are calculated based on the midpoint between consecutive bins to ensure accurate binning.
