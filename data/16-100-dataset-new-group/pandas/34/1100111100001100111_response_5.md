The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the handling of daylight saving time transitions. It fails to correctly adjust the label for the bin corresponding to the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change in Cuba. This leads to an AmbiguousTimeError when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency.

The bug occurs because the function directly constructs the `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` without considering the possibility of ambiguous timestamps resulting from a daylight saving time transition. This causes the error when trying to group the data by day, as the label for the ambiguous timestamp is not handled correctly.

To resolve this issue, a strategy to fix the bug would be to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to use the `get_label` method of the `DatetimeIndex` to handle ambiguous timestamps. Additionally, a check to detect and handle ambiguous timestamps should be included to ensure that the labels are correctly assigned for each day, especially around the time of the clock change.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Replace direct use of date_range with get_label to handle ambiguous timestamps
    binner = labels = ax.get_label(self.freq, tz=ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")
  
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `get_label` method is used to construct the `binner` and `labels`, ensuring that ambiguous timestamps are handled properly, which should resolve the error when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency.
