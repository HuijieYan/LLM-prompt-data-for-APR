The potential error in the `_get_time_bins` function is that it seems to be incorrectly calculating the time bins, which could lead to incorrect labels and bins being generated.

The `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` test is failing, which can be caused by the buggy function `_get_time_bins` not handling the time bins and labels properly. This can result in the incorrect calculation of the mean in the test, leading to a failed assertion.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of time bins and labels is correct within the `_get_time_bins` function. It may involve adjusting the bin edges, handling time zone conversions, and taking care of daylight saving time transitions.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().floor(self.freq) + pd.Timedelta(self.freq)

    binner = pd.date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
    ax_values = ax.values.astype('datetime64[ns]')
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    labels = bins[:-1]  # Adjust labels based on the 'closed' property

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we have changed the calculation of the `first` and `last` time bins and have adjusted the labels based on the 'closed' property. Additionally, we have used `pd` prefix for relevant functions and classes to ensure consistency and avoid potential conflicts with current imports. This corrected version should handle time bins and labels properly, which will hopefully fix the failing test.
