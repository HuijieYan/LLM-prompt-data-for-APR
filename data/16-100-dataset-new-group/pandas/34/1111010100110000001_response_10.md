From the error message, it seems that there is an issue related to time resolution and daylight saving time (DST). It appears that the `date_range` function called within the `_get_time_bins` method is causing the error, specifically related to ambiguous time during daylight saving time transition.

The cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function does not handle daylight saving time transitions properly when creating time bins. It is raising an `AmbiguousTimeError` because it is unable to infer daylight saving time from a specific date. 

To fix this bug, we need to handle the ambiguous time issue during daylight saving time transition within the `_get_time_bins` method. We can do this by explicitly specifying the method to handle ambiguous time, which is the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        # GH #12037
        # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
        # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
        # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
        # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            # Handle ambiguous time during daylight saving time transition
            ambiguous="NaT",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

With the above fix, the `ambiguous` parameter is set to "NaT" within the `date_range` call. This tells Pandas to create an ambiguous time as 'NaT' (Not a Time) when it encounters DST ambiguous times, which resolves the issue in the failing test.
