## Analysis
The bug is causing an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to perform groupby with a daily frequency on a day with a time change in Cuba. The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class located in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file.

The key issue arises from the fact that on a long clock-change day in Cuba, a midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. The groupby functionality does not handle this as expected, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the calculation of the bin edges for the groupby operation. This is confirmed by the error message indicating that an AmbiguousTimeError is raised when trying to infer the DST time, specifically at midnight on the day of the clock change in Cuba.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug causes the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError when trying to perform the groupby operation on a day of time change in Cuba. The failure occurs due to the incorrect calculation of bin edges and labels, which do not consider the ambiguous nature of the timestamps.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` method needs to be modified to account for the ambiguous timestamps when calculating bin edges and labels. This would involve considering the specific handling of timestamps on days of time change.

## Bug Fix
```python
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT, Period, Timestamp
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range
# Additional required import
from pytz import AmbiguousTimeError

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected `_get_time_bins` function
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # Other functions within the class remain the same

    # The corrected _get_time_bins function
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # Check for ambiguous time and handle accordingly
        if isinstance(ax.tz, object) and ax.tz._utc_transition_times:
            try:
                bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
                    ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
                )
            except AmbiguousTimeError:
                bin_edges = [b.to_datetime64() for b in binner[:-1]]
                bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
                    ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
                )
        else:
            bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
                ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
            )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the fix, the `_get_time_bins` method has been updated to handle the case of ambiguous time when generating the bins and labels. It checks for the presence of UTC transition times and uses them to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately.

This fix should address the issue and prevent the AmbiguousTimeError when performing groupby on days with time changes in Cuba.
