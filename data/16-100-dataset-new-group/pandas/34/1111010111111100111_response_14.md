To address the issue, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class. The bug is related to the handling of ambiguous times, especially concerning the "AmbiguousTimeError" in the failing test.

After analyzing the code and the failing test details, it can be identified that the issue is related to the improper handling of ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba. 

The cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function is used to create the bins, but it does not handle ambiguous time stamps correctly, leading to the "AmbiguousTimeError" when using `groupby` on a datetime index that contains ambiguous times.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the ambiguous timestamps explicitly in the `_get_time_bins` function by using the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` methods after creating the `binner` and `labels`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got " f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps
    binner = binner.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")
    labels = labels.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, after creating the `binner` and `labels`, we use the `tz_localize` method to handle ambiguous times. The `ambiguous="infer"` argument is passed to the `tz_localize` method to infer the ambiguous times automatically.

By handling the ambiguous timestamps explicitly, the corrected version should resolve the "AmbiguousTimeError" and pass the failing test. This fix aligns with the reported issue on GitHub and is a step towards resolving the problem with the groupby operation on a datetime index with ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba.
