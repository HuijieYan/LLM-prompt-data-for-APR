The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely related to the calculation of bins and labels, especially in scenarios where Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions are involved. This can lead to incorrect binning and labeling of data, causing the failing test.

The issue arises from the discrepancy between the timezone-aware index and the frequency-related calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for calculating bins and labels to handle timezone transitions correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of "
            f"{type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor('D')
    last = ax.max().floor('D') + pd.Timedelta(days=1)

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner if self.closed == "right" else binner[:-1]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by using the `floor` method to adjust the start and end points for binning, taking into account potential DST transitions. Additionally, the logic for determining the `labels` has been adjusted based on whether the bins are closed on the right.

These corrections should ensure that the function handles DST transitions correctly and produces the expected results as indicated by the failing test.
