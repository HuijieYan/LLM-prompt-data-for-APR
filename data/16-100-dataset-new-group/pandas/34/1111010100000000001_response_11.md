The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in `pandas/core/resample.py`. This function is responsible for generating time bins for time-interval grouping based on the input axis.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The calculation of `first` and `last` using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function.
2. The adjustment of bin edges using `_adjust_bin_edges` function.
3. The generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`.

The cause of the bug is not replacing the `first` and `last` timestamps properly, which can lead to incorrect bin boundaries and the wrong number of bins being generated.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `first` and `last` timestamps are calculated accurately, the bin edges are adjusted correctly, and the bins are generated with the proper boundaries.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor(self.freq)
    last = ax[-1].ceil(self.freq)

    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, closed=self.closed)
    label_freq = self.freq if self.label == 'left' else binner.freq
    labels = date_range(start=first, end=last + self.freq, freq=label_freq, closed=self.closed)
    bins, _ = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, binner.asi8, self.closed, has_nans=ax.hasnans)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `first` and `last` timestamps are calculated using the `floor` and `ceil` methods and the bin edges are adjusted correctly. Finally, the bins are generated using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` with the proper boundaries.
