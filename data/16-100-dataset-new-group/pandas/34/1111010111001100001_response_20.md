The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the handling of daylight saving time transitions in the input DatetimeIndex `ax`. When the index contains a transition with an overlapping hour, it causes issues with the binning process resulting in incorrect bins and labels.

The bug appears to be caused by the way the function calculates the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, which doesn't handle the transition properly.

To fix this bug, a strategy to explicitly handle the daylight saving time transitions is necessary. This can be achieved by using the `DatetimeIndex.normalize` method to adjust the timestamps to common time within the time zone. Additionally, applying `DatetimeIndex.tz_localize` to the `binner` and `labels` will ensure that they are correctly aware of the time zone changes.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    ax_normalized = ax.normalize()
    binner = ax_normalized.asfreq(self.freq, method='bfill')
    binner = binner.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous='infer')

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == 'right':
        labels = binner
        if self.label == 'right':
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == 'right':
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes the necessary adjustments to handle the Daylight Saving Time transitions and should address the issues with the failing test.
