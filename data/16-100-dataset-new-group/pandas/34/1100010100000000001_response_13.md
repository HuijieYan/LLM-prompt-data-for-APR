## Analyzing the buggy function
The function `_get_time_bins` takes as input a DatetimeIndex and then performs various calculations to determine the time bins, bin edges, and labels. The issue with the function is that it is not generating the correct labels for the bins in all cases, leading to potential misalignment between the labels and the bins.

## Potential error locations
1. The calculation of `labels` and `binner` might be incorrect, especially when dealing with different closed and label values.
2. The adjustment of labels when the number of bins is less than the number of labels may not be working as intended.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect calculation of labels, especially when handling different closed and label values, or when there are not enough bins to match the labels.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Adjust the logic for generating `labels` and `binner` to ensure that they align correctly with the bins based on the specified `closed` and `label` parameters.
2. Ensure that when the number of bins is less than the number of labels, the adjustment of labels is executed correctly and does not lead to misalignment.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Generate binner and labels
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed  # Pass the closed parameter to ensure correct alignment
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner[:-1]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the logic for generating `labels` and `binner` has been adjusted to ensure correct alignment based on the `closed` and `label` parameters. Additionally, the adjustment of labels when the number of bins is less than the number of labels has been updated to ensure proper alignment.
