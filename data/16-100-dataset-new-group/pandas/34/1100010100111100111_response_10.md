### Fixing the bug

The bug appears to be related to the handling of the ambiguous time during a clock change day in Cuba. The error message indicates that the code cannot infer the DST time, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

The issue reflects that this type of problem was not handled properly in pandas 0.24.2, indicating a possible bug in the implementation.

To fix the bug, it seems that the date_range creation and handling of the timezone on the clock change day might be the cause. The ambiguous timestamp at midnight local time needs to be handled properly to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to explicitly handle the ambiguous time during the clock change day by adjusting the date_range creation and the handling of the timezone. Additionally, proper handling of the timezone and the ambiguous timestamp can help in resolving the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Based on the bug analysis and the potential fix, the following corrected version of the function can be provided:

```python

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner, bins, labels = self._get_binner_for_time(ax, first, last)

    return binner, bins, labels

def _get_binner_for_time(self, ax, first, last):
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `_get_time_bins` function now calls a separate method `_get_binner_for_time` to handle the creation of the date range and adjustments for the ambiguous time during the clock change day. The `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function has been set to "NaT" to handle the ambiguous time explicitly.

This corrected version aims to specifically address the issue of handling the ambiguous time during a clock change day, which should help resolve the AmbiguousTimeError.
