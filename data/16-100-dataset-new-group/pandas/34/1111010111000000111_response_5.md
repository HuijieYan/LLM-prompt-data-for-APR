### Analysis:
The test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight()` is failing due to a bug in the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class.

The GitHub issue describes the problem in detail for the specific case of a long clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. The issue expects the call to `groupby` to return three groups with correct labels for each day, but due to the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function, it raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps and the creation of bins and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_get_time_bins` function not handling ambiguous timestamps properly, leading to incorrect grouping and labels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_time_bins` function handles ambiguous timestamps correctly and creates the bins and labels based on the given frequency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    if self.freq is None:
        binner = labels = ax
    else:
        binner, bin_edges = self._determine_time_bins(ax)

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(binner) < len(bin_edges):
            bins = lib.generate_bins_tz_aware(ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, self.base, self.axis, has_na=ax.hasnans, ambiguous=self.ambiguous)
        else:
            bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In this corrected version, the `_get_time_bins` function now handles the determination of time bins in a more robust way, taking into account the presence of ambiguous timestamps and creating the bins and labels accordingly.

With this correction, the test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight()` is expected to pass, and the issue described on GitHub should also be resolved.
