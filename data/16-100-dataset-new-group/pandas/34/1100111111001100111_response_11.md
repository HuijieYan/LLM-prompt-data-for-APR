The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely to be related to the handling of ambiguous time on the day of the clock change in Cuba. The `AmbiguousTimeError` is thrown when `pd.Grouper` is used to create daily groups, and this is linked to a bug in how the function handles ambiguous timestamps on that day. The bug is causing the `groupby()` operation to fail, resulting in unexpected behavior when trying to group data by day.

To address the bug, we should first identify the area of the function that handles timestamps and daylight saving time transitions. It seems that there is a problem with how the `closed` parameter is being handled on the day of the clock change, leading to incorrect binning of the data. Additionally, when identifying the bin edges, the timestamp may become ambiguous and lead to the error.

To fix the bug, we need to handle ambiguous time on the day of the clock change in Cuba explicitly, ensuring that the bin edges are correctly identified and that ambiguous timestamps are handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous time explicitly
    first = first.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")
    last = last.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The changes made include:
1. Explicitly handling ambiguous time by using `tz_localize` with the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter for the first and last timestamps.
2. Adding a check to ensure that the number of bins and labels match, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub ticket.
3. Any other missed handling discussions related to the ambiguity of data.
