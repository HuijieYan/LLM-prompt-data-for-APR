### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when using `pd.Grouper` to group data with daily frequency on a date that has an ambiguous timestamp due to a clock change, such as a daylight savings time transition. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` does not handle this case properly, which leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised when trying to group the data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle the ambiguous timestamps caused by a clock change. Specifically, we need to ensure that the labels for the bins are correctly assigned, accounting for the ambiguity, and that the bins are generated correctly for the grouped data.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    
    if self.closed == 'right':
        last = last.replace(fold=0)  # Ensure last timestamp is not ambiguous

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function includes additional handling for the case of ambiguous timestamps caused by a clock change. By ensuring that the first and last timestamps are properly adjusted to remove the ambiguity, along with correct label assignment and bin generation, the issue should be resolved.
