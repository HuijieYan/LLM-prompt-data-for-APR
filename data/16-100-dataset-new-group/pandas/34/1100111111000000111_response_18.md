The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` in the test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`. The problem is related to handling time zones and ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days. The issue in GitHub suggests that the call to groupby in the code should return three groups (one for each day, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November). The group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' (that is the first midnight, before the clock change) and it should contain the 25 hourly data points for this day.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should be updated to properly handle ambiguous timezones, ensuring that the transition on clock change days doesn't lead to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner, labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the call to `date_range` includes the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter, which will allow pandas to properly handle the ambiguous timezones, and avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError` in cases like clock change days in the specified timezone.

This correction should address the issue described in the GitHub report and make the provided test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` pass without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
