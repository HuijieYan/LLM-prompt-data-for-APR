The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group by daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. This is happening because the function is not handling time zone changes correctly, leading to an ambiguous timestamp error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the ambiguous time when creating the bins and labels for grouping. We need to ensure that the transition between standard time and daylight saving time is handled correctly in the date range generation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    start = ax.min()
    end = ax.max()
    
    if start.tzinfo is not None:
        start = start.tz_convert(None)  # Convert to naive timestamp for generating date range
        
    if end.tzinfo is not None:
        end = end.tz_convert(None)  # Convert to naive timestamp for generating date range
    
    # Generate date range without considering time zone changes
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=start,
        end=end,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Use tz_localize on the bins and labels to handle the ambiguous time
    bins = binner.tz_localize(ax.tz)
    labels = labels.tz_localize(ax.tz)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]  # Adjust labels based on closed frequency
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]  # Adjust labels based on label position

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version handles the time zone changes and ensures that the date range is generated correctly, taking into account ambiguous time during the transition between standard time and daylight saving time. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and allow the grouping to proceed correctly.
