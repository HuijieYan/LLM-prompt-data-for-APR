The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is failing to handle daylight saving time (DST) transitions, leading to incorrect labels and bins. The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the timezone transition in the `binner` and `labels` which results in misalignment with the actual timestamps.

To fix the bug, the function needs to account for the DST transition periods and adjust the labels and bins accordingly. Additionally, it needs to handle the timezone transition when generating the bins.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust for DST transition when generating the bins
    if self.freq.n == 1:
        freq_info = self.freq._field_values
        if freq_info["n"] == "D":
            bins = ax.floor("D")
        else:
            bins = ax
    else:
        # Generate bins considering the time zone
        bins = ax.tz_convert(None).to_period(self.freq).to_timestamp()

    # Get the bin edges based on the bins
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(bins, ax)

    # Generate the labels based on the bins
    labels = bins + self.freq

    # Adjust labels based on the closed and label parameters
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1, freq=self.freq)
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # Insert NaT if ax has nans
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Trim labels if there are more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we adjusted the bins based on the frequency and timezone, and then generated the bin edges and labels accordingly by accounting for the DST transition and other parameters.

With these changes, the function should now handle DST transitions correctly and pass the failing test.
