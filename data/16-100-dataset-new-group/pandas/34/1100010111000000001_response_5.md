The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in the file `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py`

In the function `_get_time_bins`, there are several potential error locations:

1. The calculation of `first` and `last` using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` may not be handling the timestamp range correctly, especially in cases involving time zone changes or Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions.

2. The adjustment of bin edges and generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` may not be aligning correctly with the time index.

3. The logic for handling `NaN` values in the time index may not be working as intended.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of time zone changes and DST transitions in the `first`, `last`, and bin edge generation steps. This could result in misaligned bins and labels, leading to incorrect resampling of the time index.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the time range calculation, bin edge adjustment, and bin generation steps correctly handle time zone changes and DST transitions.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax = ax.tz_localize("UTC")  # Ensure time index is in UTC for consistent handling
    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version:
1. The time index is localized to UTC to avoid issues with time zone changes and DST transitions.
2. The calculation of `first` and `last` is simplified to use the minimum and maximum values from the localized time index.
3. The generation of bin edges and bins is adjusted to align with the localized time index.
4. The handling of `NaN` values and label adjustment is retained from the original implementation.
