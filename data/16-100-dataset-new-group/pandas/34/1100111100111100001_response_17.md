The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of daylight savings time in the `_get_time_bins` function. The bug is particularly evident in the failing test, where an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised due to the presence of repeated times after a transition from daylight saving time.

To fix the bug, we can address the handling of daylight savings time in the `_get_time_bins` function. We should adjust the computation of `first` and `last` timestamps, taking into account the timezone and the possibility of repeated times due to transitions from daylight saving time.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust the computation of first and last timestamps to account for daylight saving time
    first, last = ax[0], ax[-1]

    # Use the frequency to generate the binner and labels
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, we directly use the first and last timestamps from the input `ax` rather than relying on the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function. This change ensures that daylight saving time transitions are properly handled, and it should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test.
