Based on the error message, the bug seems to be related to ambiguous time error occurring on November 4th, 2018 at midnight. The issue seems to be with the generation of time bins.

The bug is occurring in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class within the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function incorrectly handles daylight saving time (DST), resulting in an ambiguous time error when generating range for date range "1D". The error occurs because the date range generates an ambiguous time on the day when daylight saving time ends, causing the error. This is evident from the `AmbiguousTimeError` raised in the test.

To fix this bug, the range generation should handle ambiguous times during the transition from daylight saving time to standard time. The corrected version of the function should explicitly handle ambiguous times to prevent such an error from occurring. 

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Retrieve unique values for ax
    ax_values = ax.unique()

    # Generate range while handling ambiguous times
    binner, labels = self._generate_with_ambiguous_time(
        first, last, ax.tz, ax.name, ax_values
    )

    # Call _adjust_bin_edges to handle adjustments
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins considering the adjustments
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    # Handle label and bin adjustments
    labels = self._adjust_labels(binner, labels, bins, ax.hasnans)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, a new function `_generate_with_ambiguous_time` has been called to handle the generation of date ranges while considering ambiguous times. The `_adjust_labels` function has been used to handle any adjustments required for labels and bins. These changes aim to avoid the occurrence of an ambiguous time error in the future.

Please note that exact implementation details for `_generate_with_ambiguous_time` and `_adjust_labels` depend on internal logic and requirements of the project.
