The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the issue with down-sampling over midnight while handling daylight saving time. The function should return the expected result for the test case mentioned above, but it fails due to the incorrect handling of time bins and labels in the presence of daylight saving time adjustments.

The major cause of the bug is incorrect handling of time zone adjustments and daylight saving time transitions when creating the time bins and labels. This leads to misalignment of the bins and labels with the actual data, resulting in incorrect groupings.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the time zone adjustments and daylight saving time transitions. It should also consider any potential time zone conversions that might affect the accuracy of down-sampling.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1] + self.freq
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    bin_edges = np.concatenate(([ax[0]], ax))
    
    bins = np.searchsorted(binner, bin_edges, side='right') - 1
    labels = binner[bins]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected implementation, the time bins and labels are created by setting the `first` timestamp as the first element of the input `ax` and `last` as the last element of the input `ax` plus the `freq`. The `binner` and `bin_edges` are then created using the `date_range` function with the adjusted `first` and `last` timestamps. The `bins` are obtained by searching the `binner` for the `bin_edges` using `searchsorted`, and the `labels` are obtained using the indices from `bins`. Lastly, if `ax` has any NaN values, a `NaT` is inserted at the beginning of the `labels` array.

This implementation should now correctly handle the time zone adjustments, daylight saving time transitions, and time zone conversions, producing the expected down-sampled result for the failing test case.
