The bug in the given function seems to be in the calculation and adjustment of the `bin_edges` and `labels`. The calculation of `bin_edges` and `labels` is expected to be based on the time range in the `DatetimeIndex`, but the current implementation seems to have issues with creating the correct bins and labels for the time intervals.

It seems that there is a mismatch between the calculated timestamps for `bin_edges` and labels, and the expected value based on the provided input parameters.

To fix the bug, we need to update the implementation of the `_get_time_bins` function to correctly calculate the `bin_edges` and create the corresponding labels based on the time intervals specified by the input parameters.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize() + self.freq
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed)
    bin_edges = binner[:-1].append(binner[-1] + self.freq)
    labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bin_edges, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `bin_edges` and `labels` are calculated based on the frequency of the time intervals and the time range specified by the `ax` input, rather than direct calculation from the timestamps.

This revised implementation should address the issue with incorrect bin edges and labels and provide the expected result.
