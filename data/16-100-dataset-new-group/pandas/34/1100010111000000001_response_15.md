### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the resampling functionality in pandas. The function takes a DatetimeIndex `ax` and performs a series of calculations to determine time bins and labels for resampling.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Using `date_range` to create `binner` and `labels` without considering the potential impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions.
2. Incorrectly adjusting the labels if there are more labels than bins.

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is testing the resampling behavior with a DatetimeIndex that includes DST transitions.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `_get_time_bins` function not properly handling the DST transitions. When `date_range` is used to create `binner` and `labels`, the DST transitions are not taken into account, leading to incorrect bin boundaries and labels.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to use a more robust method for creating time bins and labels that accounts for potential DST transitions. Additionally, the adjustment of labels when there are more labels than bins should be reviewed for correctness.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bin_edges = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, self.freq, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax_values, bin_edges)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bin_edges) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bin_edges)]

    return binner, bin_edges, labels
```
In the corrected version of the function, `generate_bins_dt64` is used to calculate the bin edges based on the `ax_values` and other parameters. The adjustment of labels is also corrected to use the length of `bin_edges` for comparison.

With this correction, the `_get_time_bins` function should now properly handle DST transitions and accurately determine the time bins and labels for resampling.
