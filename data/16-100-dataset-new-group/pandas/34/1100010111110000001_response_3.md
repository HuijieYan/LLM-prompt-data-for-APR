The cause of the bug is likely due to an incorrect time binning in the `_get_time_bins` function, leading to an ambiguous time error. This is evidenced by the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` which produces the error `AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times`.

The issue is occurring when trying to create date ranges and time bins, presumably causing ambiguous or repeated times, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the date ranges and time bins are created without any ambiguities or repeated times, thereby avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

We can fix the bug by using the `closed` parameter of the `date_range` function, which determines whether the start and end points are considered as closed (included in the range) or open (excluded from the range).

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed='left'  # Set the closed parameter to avoid ambiguous times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By setting the `closed` parameter in the `date_range` function to `'left'`, it ensures that ambiguous times are avoided by excluding the end point from the range. This should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test.
