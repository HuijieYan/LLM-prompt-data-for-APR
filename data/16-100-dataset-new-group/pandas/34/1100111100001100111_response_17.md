Based on the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be caused by an ambiguous timestamp on a clock change day in Cuba. Given that the issue seems to be related to handling the time bins and labels correctly for the ambiguous timestamp, the bug is most likely within the `_get_time_bins` function. In the provided runtime values, we can see that the variables `ax_values`, `bins`, and `labels` are all related to the time bins and labels, which might be causing the AmbiguousTimeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could be to handle the ambiguous time error by checking for it within the `_get_time_bins` function and adjusting the time bins and labels accordingly. 

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import DatetimeArray
    
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError("axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}")
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    if not isinstance(first, Timestamp) or not isinstance(last, Timestamp):
        first = Timestamp(first) if not isinstance(first, Timestamp) else first
        last = Timestamp(last) if not isinstance(last, Timestamp) else last
    
    # creating timezone-aware date_range for both first and last
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first.tz_convert(ax.tz),
        end=last.tz_convert(ax.tz),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we first convert `first` and `last` to `Timestamp` objects and ensure that they are timezone-aware. Additionally, we use the `tz_convert` method to handle the ambiguous timestamp by converting both `first` and `last` to the timezone of the input `ax`, which should help in resolving the AmbiguousTimeError.
