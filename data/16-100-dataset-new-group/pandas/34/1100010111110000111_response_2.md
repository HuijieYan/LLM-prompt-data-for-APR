Based on the provided test and error message, it seems that the issue is related to handling of ambiguous time during a clock change day in Cuba. The failing test is attempting to downsample data using a daily frequency, and on the day when the clocks change in Cuba, it raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This is due to the inability of the `groupby` function to handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly.

The issue appears to have already been reported on GitHub with the title "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba", and it seems to be a bug in the pandas library.

To fix this bug, a strategy would involve modifying the `_get_time_bins` function to handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This would involve making changes to the logic used to create the time bins and labels on the clock change day.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        bins = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        labels = bins if self.label == "right" else bins[1:]
    else:
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        bins = binner if self.label == "right" else binner[1:]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version handles the creation of time bins and labels based on the closed/right and label/right conditions, ensuring that the ambiguous timestamp is handled correctly. With this fix, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
