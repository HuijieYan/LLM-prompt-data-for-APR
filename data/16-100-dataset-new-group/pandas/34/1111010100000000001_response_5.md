##  The buggy function analysis and potential error locations
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class and is responsible for generating time bins for time-interval grouping. The potential error locations within the function include date range generation, adjustment of bin edges, and comparison between the number of bins and labels.

##  Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function lies in the date range generation and the adjustment of bin edges, which may lead to incorrect binning when dealing with intervals that contain nanosecond parts. Additionally, there is a potential issue with the comparison between the number of bins and labels.

##  Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the date range generation preserves the nanosecond parts and adjusts the bin edges correctly. Additionally, we need to accurately compare the number of bins and labels to handle the situation where there are more labels than bins.

##  Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        base=self.base
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected version of the function, adjustments have been made to ensure that the date range generation preserves nanosecond parts, correct bin edge adjustment, and accurate comparison between the number of bins and labels.
