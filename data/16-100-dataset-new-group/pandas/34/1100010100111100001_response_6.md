The bug in the provided function appears to be related to the generation of time bins and labels for resampling. The error message indicates an issue with inferring daylight saving time from a specific datetime, which suggests that there might be a problem with the handling of daylight saving time transitions within the function.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the handling of daylight saving time transitions is accurate and does not lead to ambiguous time errors. This may involve adjusting the process for generating time bins and labels to account for potential DST transitions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1] + self.freq

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version primarily makes changes to the generation of time bins and labels, ensuring that the handling of daylight saving time transitions is more accurate.

This version of the function should pass the failing test.
