### Bug analysis
The error message indicates that the function is failing to infer the DST time due to some ambiguity. This is likely related to the timezone shifts and the conversion from UTC to "America/Havana" timezone, which is causing inconsistencies in the calculation of the time bins.

Looking at the function, it seems to be handling the time bins and labels by using the `date_range` function, adjusting bin edges, and generating bins. It also involves considerations for the timezone and ambiguous/nonexistent times.

The bug might be related to the handling of the timezone shift and the adjustment of the time bins with respect to DST changes.

### Bug fix strategy
1. The bug is likely related to the handling of timezones and DST changes. It's crucial to ensure that the datetime conversion and timezone adjustments are done correctly without creating ambiguities.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting bin edges and generating bins, considering the timezone differences and DST-related shifts.
3. Check if the adjustments for ambiguous and nonexistent times are being correctly applied.

### Updated code
```python
from pytz import AmbiguousTimeError
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT, libi8
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range
from pandas._libs.tslibs.conversion import tz_localize_to_utc

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
        )

        ax_values = tz_localize_to_utc(ax).asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        bins = lib.generate_bins_for_time(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = binner[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes a more robust handling of timezones, ensuring that ambiguous times are inferred correctly, and the adjustments for non-existent times are also handled properly. Additionally, the function `lib.generate_bins_for_time` is used to generate the bins, which would handle time differences and DST changes more effectively.

By making these changes, the function should be able to handle the DST shifts and timezone adjustments more accurately, resolving the issue that led to the ambiguous time error.
