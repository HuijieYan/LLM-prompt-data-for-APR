The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function likely causes the `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on clock change days in Cuba. The bug may be related to how the function handles timestamps, particularly on ambiguous days due to the clock change. One potential error location could be the conversion of timestamps and their frequency, leading to incorrect binning and label generation.

One strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the date range generation for `binner` and `labels` to properly handle the ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. Additionally, ensuring that the label for the 4th of November is correctly assigned as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' could resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected version, the date range generation for `binner` and `labels` includes proper timezone handling, ambiguous time inference, and adjustments for nonexistent timestamps. This should address the bug and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report regarding the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
