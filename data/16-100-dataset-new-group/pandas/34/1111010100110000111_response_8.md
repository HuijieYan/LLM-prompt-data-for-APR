### Analysis
The bug occurs when using the `groupby` function on a datetime index in a timezone that has a clock change (such as a transition to or from daylight savings time). It results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` because the `pd.Grouper` fails to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days correctly.

### Potential Error Locations
The bug appears to be related to the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class.

### Cause of the Bug
The error is caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days within the `_get_time_bins` function. This is evidenced by the `AmbiguousTimeError` message and confirmed by the GitHub issue description. The issue states that the call to `groupby` should handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly, but it currently raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be updated to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, specifically by dealing with the transition to or from daylight savings time.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust timestamps to UTC to handle ambiguous times
    ax = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_localize("UTC")

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the timestamps are adjusted to UTC before creating the bins using `date_range`. This ensures that ambiguous timestamps, particularly those related to daylight savings time transitions, are properly handled and do not result in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
