The potential errors in the provided code are related to the incorrect implementation of the `_get_time_bins` function. The function seems to have issues with generating the time bins and labels correctly.

The buggy function attempts to generate time bins and labels based on the input DatetimeIndex `ax`. However, there are several issues in the current implementation, including potential mishandling of timestamps and incorrect comparison of the lengths of bins and labels.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the algorithm for generating time bins and labels to ensure that they are consistent and accurate based on the input DatetimeIndex. Additionally, we should validate the logic for adjusting the labels based on the frequency and closed parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    bin_edges = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        closed=self.closed,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    binner = bin_edges
    labels = bin_edges[1:] if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right" else bin_edges

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, bin_edges.values, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we directly use the `date_range` function to generate the bin edges, and then adjust the labels based on the frequency and closed parameters. We also use the `generate_bins_dt64` function to generate the bins based on the adjusted bin edges.

This revised implementation should address the potential issues in the original function and ensure the accurate generation of time bins and labels based on the input DatetimeIndex.
