The buggy function `_get_time_bins` seems to be failing to handle the situation where the timezone is changing on a given day. The bug may be related to the `ax_values = ax.asi8` line, which might be impacting the accuracy of the binning process. The bug could also potentially be related to the `closed` and `label` parameters in the `date_range` function call. The issue reported on GitHub also indicates that there may be an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps, particularly on days with changes in daylight saving time.

To fix this bug, it will be important to ensure that the timestamp range calculation is handling the potential ambiguity due to timezone changes, and that the binning process accounts for this ambiguity as well.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Handle non-existent times
    )

    # Adjust bin edges considering ambiguous times
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins considering ambiguous times
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version aims to handle ambiguous and non-existent times more effectively by setting relevant parameters in the `date_range` function and adjusting the bin edges accordingly. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
