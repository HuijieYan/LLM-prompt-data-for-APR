The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in the pandas library.

The potential error locations within the `_get_time_bins` function are:
1. The calculation of `first` and `last` using `_get_timestamp_range_edges`.
2. The adjustment of the `binner` using `_adjust_bin_edges`.
3. The generation of `bins` using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`.
4. The adjustments to `labels` and `binner` based on conditions.

The cause of the bug is that the calculation and adjustment of the bins and labels are not taking into account the timezone and handling of daylight saving time (DST) transitions. This results in incorrect binning and labeling of the time intervals, leading to the failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the time intervals are calculated and adjusted correctly, taking into account the timezone and DST transitions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(
            data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz
        )
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    if hasattr(ax, "tz") and ax.tz is not None:
        first = first.tz_localize(None)
        last = last.tz_localize(None)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the timezone information is retained and handled properly throughout the calculations and adjustments. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
