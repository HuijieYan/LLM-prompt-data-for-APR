The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely related to the handling of time zone conversions and daylight saving time transitions. The error message indicates that an "AmbiguousTimeError" is being raised when trying to infer the daylight saving time from a specific datetime.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it can be noted that the issue might arise from the time zone conversion and localization. The ambiguous time error is likely due to the combination of the specific date and time at which the transition from daylight saving time occurs in the given time zone.

A potential fix for this issue could involve explicitly handling the ambiguous time scenario by providing the necessary information to resolve the ambiguity. This may include using a different approach to handle time zone transitions and localization during the creation of the date range for `binner` and `labels`. Using the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters in the `date_range` function more explicitly to handle ambiguous times may help resolve this issue.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that incorporates these considerations:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous time explicitly
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by returning NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Shift nonexistent times forward
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

By explicitly handling ambiguous times and nonexistent times during the creation of the date range, the function should now be able to handle scenarios where the transition from daylight saving time causes ambiguity, and the "AmbiguousTimeError" should no longer be raised.
