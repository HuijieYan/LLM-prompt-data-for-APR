The issue appears to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps on a clock-change day in Cuba. The failing test is trying to group data by daily frequency, and on a day with a time change, it raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The bug seems to be related to how the function `_get_time_bins` handles the time changes on a long clock-change day.

Upon analyzing the input/output values and types, it looks like the issue arises from handling the transition from standard time to daylight saving time (DST) in the `America/Havana` time zone, particularly around the time change that occurs at midnight between November 4th and November 5th.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle the transition from standard time (UTC-4) to daylight saving time (UTC-5) on the date when the clock change occurs. The function should handle the ambiguous time period correctly and ensure proper grouping of the data.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Ensure correct handling of ambiguous time during the clock change
    first = ax[0].floor('D')
    last = ax[-1].floor('D') + pd.Timedelta(days=1) - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Use libgenerate_bins to generate bins correctly
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    labels = binner
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Ensure correct handling when the number of labels exceeds the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making the above changes, the corrected function should properly handle the ambiguous time period and correctly group the data on the clock-change day, resolving the issue reported on GitHub. This modified function should enable the failing test to pass and address the problem described in the GitHub issue.
