The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` because it does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially on days with a DST change.

The bug occurs when the function tries to create time bins using the `date_range` function, but this leads to ambiguous timestamps on days with a DST change. As a result, when the `groupby` method is called on the dataframe with a daily frequency, it raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`, as demonstrated in the failing test.

To fix the bug, it's important to adjust the logic for creating time bins to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially on days with a DST change. This involves considering the DST transitions and ensuring that time bins are created without ambiguity.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the start and end times
    start_time = ax[0].tz_convert(None).floor('D')
    end_time = ax[-1].tz_convert(None).ceil('D')

    # Generate the time bins accounting for the DST transition
    bins = []
    current_time = start_time
    while current_time <= end_time:
        bins.append(current_time)
        current_time += self.freq

    # Create the labels from the bins
    labels = bins[:-1]  # Exclude the bin boundary at the end

    return bins, labels
```

This corrected version handles DST transitions and generates time bins without ambiguity, ensuring that the `groupby` method will no longer raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The corrected function works by explicitly considering the start and end times, as well as iterating through the time range and creating bins accordingly. This ensures that ambiguous timestamps on days with a DST change are handled correctly.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions or issues!
