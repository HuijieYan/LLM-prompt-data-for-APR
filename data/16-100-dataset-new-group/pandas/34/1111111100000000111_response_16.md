The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely causing the issue with the daily frequency failing with an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba. The bug may be related to the `date_range` call in which the `ambiguous` parameter is set to "infer," leading to an incorrect inference of ambiguous times during the clock change day in Cuba.

To fix this bug, we should explicitly handle the ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day. We can achieve this by modifying the `date_range` call to explicitly handle the ambiguous time on the clock change day by setting the ambiguous parameter appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

        # Explicitly handle ambiguous time during clock change day
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous=" NaT",  # Specify how ambiguous times should be handled
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
        # ...

        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` call has been explicitly set to "NaT" to handle ambiguous times during the clock change day. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
