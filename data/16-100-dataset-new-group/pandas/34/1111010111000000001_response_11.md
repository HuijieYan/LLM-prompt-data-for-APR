The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for generating time bins and labels. The logic for adjusting bin edges and generating bins could be causing the bug. The function is not handling time zone conversions and daylight saving time changes properly, which is likely causing the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling time zone changes and daylight saving time properly when generating time bins and labels.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle time zone conversions and daylight saving time changes properly when generating time bins and labels.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(self.freq)
    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max() + self.freq
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    labels = binner
    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we handle time zone conversions properly by using `tz_localize` method and handle daylight saving time changes by adding the frequency to the last timestamp. The bin edges are adjusted accordingly. We also set the `labels` variable directly without further checks, as the correct labels are generated without any specific adjustments.
