The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing the test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to fail. The specific issue is that `pd.Grouper` is not handling ambiguous timestamps, which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the grouping process. This error occurs due to the way timestamp ranges are calculated and adjusted when transitioning to or from daylight saving time.

To resolve the bug, you can modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps properly by taking into account DST transitions. Specifically, the `date_range` function is currently used to create the bins, and it does not handle the ambiguity during the transition. You will need to modify this part to ensure that ambiguous timestamps are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.tz_localize(None).min(), ax.tz_localize(None).max(), self.freq, 
        closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `first` and `last` timestamps are obtained by localizing the timestamps to `None` timezone prior to getting the min and max value. Additionally, the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function is set to "infer" to handle ambiguous times during the transition. These changes should ensure that the function properly handles timestamps with ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions.
