### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function as it's used before the bug occurs.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `labels` are being truncated based on the provided bins, resulting in an inconsistent number of labels and bins. This is due to the logic applied in the code where labels are truncated without considering the possibility of different frequencies of data.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the number of labels matches the number of bins, regardless of data frequency. This can be achieved by adjusting how the labels are truncated or ensuring that bins and labels always match.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values, closed=self.closed)  # Adjusting bin edges

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner  # Setting labels to binner initially

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected version, the `_adjust_bin_edges` function is passed an additional argument to determine the binning strategy based on the `'closed'` attribute. Additionally, the labels are initially set to match the `binner`, ensuring consistency. If the number of bins is less than the number of labels, the labels are adjusted to match the number of bins, resolving the bug.
