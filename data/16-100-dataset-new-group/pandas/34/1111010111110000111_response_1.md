The bug within the function `_get_time_bins` lies in the way it handles time zone conversions and the generation of date ranges, particularly on days with DST transitions. This issue is characterized by the `AmbiguousTimeError` raised during the test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` when using `pd.Grouper` to group data on days with time transitions like Daylight Saving Time. It fails to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, which leads to the error.

To address this bug, it is essential to utilize pandas' internal functionality for working with time zones and handling ambiguous timestamps during date range generation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the bug:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins, labels = get_bins_and_labels(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, self.label, binner
    )

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected version, the date range generation and handling of ambiguous timestamps are delegated to pandas' internal functionality, which can correctly handle the DST transitions. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and make the `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` pass, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
