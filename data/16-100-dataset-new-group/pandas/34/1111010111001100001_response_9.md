The buggy function `_get_time_bins` has an issue with the way it's handling time zone conversions and binning. The issue arises when converting the timezone and generating the bins, which results in the mismatch between the time labels and the actual bins.

The cause of the bug is that the time labels and bin edges are not being adjusted properly to account for the time zone conversions and potential daylight saving time changes. This results in incorrect binning and labeling, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the time labels and bin edges are adjusted correctly based on the time zone information and potential daylight saving time changes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, 
        end=last, 
        freq=self.freq, 
        tz=ax.tz, 
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes adjustments for the time labels and bin edges based on the time zone information and potential DST changes. This should address the issue and ensure that the function passes the failing tests.
