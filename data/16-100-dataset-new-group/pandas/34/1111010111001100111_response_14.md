### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` inside the `TimeGrouper` class is failing to handle the ambiguous time on the day of a clock change in Cuba. The issue is related to the incorrect labeling of the midnight timestamp in the group for the day of the clock change.

The `ax` input parameter is a `DatetimeIndex` containing hourly timestamps that include the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change. The `freq` and `closed` properties of the `TimeGrouper` instance are set to `'1D'` and `'left'` respectively. The timezone information and other properties are also correctly set.

The bug seems to be in the calculation of the `binner`, `labels`, and `bins`, specifically related to the handling of the midnight timestamp on the day of the clock change.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `binner` and `labels` are generated using the `date_range` function with the `start` and `end` arguments as `first` and `last`. However, this approach does not handle the ambiguous timestamp at midnight on the day of the clock change, leading to incorrect labeling and binning.

Additionally, the subsequent processing of the `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `bins` does not properly account for the ambiguous time, resulting in incorrect binning and labeling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can modify the approach of generating `binner` and `labels` to account for ambiguous timestamps, and then adjust the subsequent processing to correctly handle the ambiguous time at midnight on the day of the clock change.

### Corrected Version
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.resample import TimeGrouper
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range
from pandas._libs import lib


class TimeGrouper(TimeGrouper):
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
        
        binner = date_range(
            start=first,
            end=last + pd.Timedelta(days=1),
            freq=self.freq,
            closed=self.closed,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward"
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, np.datetime64('NaT'))
            labels = labels.insert(0, np.datetime64('NaT'))
        
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the approach for generating `binner` and `labels` is modified to account for the ambiguous timestamp at midnight on the day of the clock change. Additionally, the subsequent processing of the `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `bins` is adjusted to handle the ambigous time correctly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test function.
