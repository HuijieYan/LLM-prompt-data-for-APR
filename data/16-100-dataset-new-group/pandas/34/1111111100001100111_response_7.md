The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function appears to be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, particularly in Cuba. The bug is causing the `groupby` function to raise an AmbiguousTimeError, preventing it from correctly grouping the data by day.

Given the GitHub issue and the runtime input values, it seems that the problem arises from the handling of timestamps around midnight on the day of the clock change in Cuba. The code is not correctly accounting for the ambiguous time created by the clock change, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the handling of ambiguous timestamps needs to be improved, specifically by revisiting how the first and last timestamps are calculated and how the bins and labels are created. This will address the root cause of the AmbiguousTimeError raised in the `groupby` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Correct the handling of ambiguous timestamps
    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max() + self.freq
    binner, bin_edges = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, _ = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `first` timestamp corresponds to the minimum timestamp in the input index, and the `last` timestamp is set to the maximum timestamp plus the frequency. This approach takes into account the potential ambiguity around midnight on the day of the clock change.

By addressing the handling of ambiguous timestamps and adjusting the bin creation accordingly, the bug causing the AmbiguousTimeError should be resolved, and the `groupby` function should be able to correctly group the data by day.
