The bug in the function is related to incorrect handling of the last bin edge when the end contains a nanosecond part. The `date_range` function is used to create the "binner" and "labels," but when the end contains a nanosecond part, it can lead to an error where "Values falls after last bin." Additionally, there are issues with misaligned "labels" and "bins" in the case of more labels than bins.

To fix the bug, the "binner" and "labels" creation using the `date_range` function needs to be modified to ensure a correct handling of nanosecond parts in the last bin.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last + self.freq,  # Added self.freq to ensure that the end of the range is included
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    labels = binner[:-1]  # Labels should exclude the last bin, which now includes the end

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version:
1. When using `date_range` to create "binner" and "labels," the end of the range has been adjusted to include the last bin by adding `self.freq`.
2. The "labels" are adjusted to exclude the last bin, ensuring that there is no misalignment between "labels" and "bins."

These changes should fix the bug by ensuring that the last bin is correctly handled, even when the end contains a nanosecond part, and that there is no misalignment between "labels" and "bins".
