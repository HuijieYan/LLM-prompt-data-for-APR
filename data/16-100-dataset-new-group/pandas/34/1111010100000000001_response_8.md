The function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class. It takes `ax` as an argument, which is expected to be an instance of `DatetimeIndex`. The function then performs various operations to calculate time bins and labels based on the frequency and other parameters set in the class.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. The type check `if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex)` does not account for subclasses of `DatetimeIndex`.
2. The adjustment of bins and labels based on the frequency and other parameters may lead to incorrect calculations.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling potential subclass instances of `DatetimeIndex`, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, especially when passing a subclass instance.

To fix the bug, the type checking for `DatetimeIndex` should be more robust to include subclasses, and the operations related to bin and label adjustment should be carefully reviewed and potentially revised.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not issubclass(type(ax), DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex or its subclass, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
