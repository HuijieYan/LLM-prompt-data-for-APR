To fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function, we need to handle the case where an ambiguous time occurs in the input datetime index.

Analyze the bug:

1. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` tries to group the data by days using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')`, and this operation is triggering the error in the `_get_time_bins` function.
2. The error message states that the code cannot infer daylight saving time from a specific timestamp, which occurs because the clock changes for the day in Cuba.
3. The key issue is the ambiguous timestamp at midnight on a clock change day, which is causing the failure in the grouping operation.
4. The problematic part of the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the computation of the `binner` and `labels` for the time groups, where the ambiguous timestamp is not being handled correctly.

Given this information, we can fix the bug by adjusting how the `binner` and `labels` are computed to handle the ambiguous timestamp.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous time to ensure correct grouping
    tz_dst = ax[-1].tz
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer"
    )
    
    if pd.to_datetime(last, utc=True).tz_convert(tz_dst).time() == pd.Timedelta('00:00:00'):
        last -= pd.Timedelta('01:00:00')
        binner = binner[:-1]

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, we handle the ambiguous time scenario by checking if the last timestamp is at midnight and, if so, adjust the value and the `binner` accordingly to ensure the correct grouping.
