The issue reported on GitHub demonstrates a bug when using pd.Grouper with daily frequency on clock change days in Cuba, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError. The bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on long clock-change days, such as November 4th, where midnight local time is ambiguous. The expected output is to return three groups for each day (November 3rd, 4th, and 5th), with the group for November 4th labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and containing 25 hourly data points for that day.

Upon analyzing the code and the reported issue, it's evident that the buggy function `_get_time_bins` aims to create bins and labels for time grouping operations, which are crucial for the proper functioning of the `groupby` method. The issue arises from the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError reported on the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the strategy is to use the `closed` and `label` parameters correctly while creating bins and labels for the time grouping. Additionally, the implementation needs to account for ambiguous timestamps that occur due to daylight saving time transitions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]

    # Create bins and labels using the correct parameters
    binner = ax
    labels = pd.date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        closed=self.closed,
        name=ax.name,
        normalize=True,
    )

    # Adjust labels if the closed end is 'right'
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1)

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax.asi8)

    # Generate bins using the updated binner and bin_edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels accordingly
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected function, we ensure that the labels for the bins are created correctly, considering the ambiguous timestamps and the `closed` parameter. Additionally, we adjust the labels if the closed end is 'right', and generate bins based on the updated binner and bin_edges.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function addresses the bug reported on the GitHub issue related to handling daily frequency grouping on clock change days in Cuba.
