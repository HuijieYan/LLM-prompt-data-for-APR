## Bug Analysis
The failing test is trying to downsample a dataframe using `pd.Grouper(freq="1D").mean()`, which is causing an AmbiguousTimeError due to a datetime index that contains ambiguous timestamps. The failing code is related to the TimeGrouper class in the `pandas.core.resample` module, specifically the `_get_time_bins` method. 

The `_get_time_bins` method calculates the bins and labels to be used for grouping the data. It takes a DatetimeIndex `ax` as input, and it calls the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` methods from the same module. The key issue is that the generated bin labels are ambiguous and do not handle daylight saving time (DST) transitions properly.

The error message suggests that there is no repeated time in the input index, and as a result, the datetime localization is ambiguous.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `pd.Grouper` should be updated to handle Daylight Saving Time transitions properly, especially on days when there is a change in the UTC offset due to DST changes.

One approach to solving this issue is to review the `_get_time_bins` method and ensure that it can handle ambiguous local times and DST transitions properly. This might involve checking for ambiguous times and handling them to create distinct bins and labels for each day.

Additionally, it's important to verify that the date range generation logic in the `_get_time_bins` method is consistent with the timezone information, DST transitions, and the nature of the input DatetimeIndex.

## Corrected Version
```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):

    # ...

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

        # ensure proper handling of DST transitions
        if self.freq.is_anchored() and self.freq.n == 1:
            first = first.normalize()
            last = last.normalize()

        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # ensure that the date range encompasses all points within a day, considering DST
        if last.hour > 0:
            last = last + Timedelta(hours=23)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner[1:]  # exclude the first bin edge
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels + Timedelta(days=1)

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # check for mismatch between bins and labels
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we handle daylight saving time transition when calculating the `first` and `last` values. We ensure that the date range created accounts for potential DST transitions. Additionally, we adjust the labels according to the frequency and the start of each bin.

By making these adjustments, we aim to resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the resampling to work correctly with DATETIME data that includes ambiguous and transition periods.
