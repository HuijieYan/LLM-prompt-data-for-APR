## Analysis
### Bugs and Cause Analysis
The issue reported on GitHub describes a problem when using the `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on a day with a clock change in Cuba. It results in an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The issue description highlights that this is a similar issue to another one that was fixed in version 0.24.

The provided function `_get_time_bins` is part of the class `TimeGrouper`, and it is crucial for generating the time bins for the `pd.Grouper` operations. The issue is most likely related to the generation of time bins that result in ambiguous timestamps on the day of a clock change in Cuba. This issue seems to be related to the timezone conversion and the ambiguity in the timestamps.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
It seems that the bug is related to the generation of time labels and bins when dealing with timezone conversions and ambiguous timestamps. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the time bins are correctly labeled without ambiguity, especially on days with clock changes.

## Bug Fix
Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue by refactoring the time bin generation to account for ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, especially in timezones such as Cuba.

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    naive = ax.tz_localize(None)
    first = naive.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = naive.max().floor(self.freq)

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        closed=self.closed,
        name=ax.name,
        tz=ax.tz,
    )
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version takes into consideration the timezone localization and uses naive timestamps when generating the time bins to avoid ambiguity on days with clock changes. This should address the issue reported on GitHub when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on the day of the clock change in Cuba.
