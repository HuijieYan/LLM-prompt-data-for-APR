Based on the provided information, the bug is related to the handling of ambiguous time due to a clock change day in Cuba. The error message is a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` due to the inability to infer dst time from a specific timestamp. This is a known issue as described in the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba."

The bug is related to the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class, which is not handling the ambiguity of timestamps on the clock change day in Cuba correctly.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to handle the ambiguous time on clock change days, ensuring that the grouping of timestamps is done appropriately without raising the AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax = ax.tz_localize(None)  # Remove timezone information
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, on line 10, we remove the timezone information from the DatetimeIndex `ax` using `tz_localize(None)` to ensure that the time is not ambiguous. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError when performing grouping operations.

By using this corrected version, the bug should be fixed, and the given failing test should pass successfully without raising the AmbiguousTimeError.
