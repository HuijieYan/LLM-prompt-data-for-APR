Looking at the error message, the specific error is a KeyError. This error is occurring when attempting to get the frequency of the DatetimeIndex `ax` when `ax` is not an instance of DatetimeIndex.

In the buggy function `_get_time_bins`, a check is made to ensure that `ax` is an instance of DatetimeIndex. If it's not, a TypeError is raised with an informative error message.

The problem seems to be that the test for checking if `ax` is a DatetimeIndex is not working correctly, as the error message suggests an issue with time conversion. This may indicate that `ax` may not be in a suitable format or type when being passed to this function.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_time_bins` should be updated to properly check the type of `ax` to ensure it is a DatetimeIndex in a reliable and robust manner.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In this corrected version, the function checks whether `ax` is either an instance of `DatetimeIndex` or `pd.DatetimeIndex` and raises an error if it is not. This should help resolve the issue with the original buggy function.
