In the given buggy function, the issue appears to be related to incorrect handling of the time bins that is leading to the AmbiguousTimeError. The error message suggests that there are no repeated times for the given date and time which leads to ambiguity in inferring the dst time.

The cause of the bug is that the date_range function is used to create the binner and labels, but it does not handle ambiguous times properly, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, a potential strategy would be to handle ambiguous times by explicitly setting the flag `ambiguous` to "NaT" or to a value based on the specific requirements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Set the ambiguous flag to "NaT" to handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By explicitly setting the `ambiguous` flag to "NaT" in the `date_range` function call, we are ensuring that ambiguous times are handled properly. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError that was occurring.
