The issue described on GitHub is related to the failure of the groupby function when using a daily frequency on a day with a time change in Cuba, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError. The expected output is for the call to groupby to return three groups for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), with the group for the 4th of November labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00'. The error occurs when the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError.

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating binner, bins, and labels, but it doesn't handle the case of an ambiguous timestamp on the day of the time change in Cuba. This leads to the generation of incorrect labels and bins, causing the groupby operation to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the timestamps are handled correctly when generating labels and bins, especially when there is an ambiguous time due to a time change. We also need to make sure that the labels are generated to match the expected output, and the AmbiguousTimeError is addressed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Generate labels and binner based on the correct index
    if isinstance(self.freq, Day) and ax.tz._is_dst(ax):
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first, 
            periods=len(ax.unique()),
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="NaT",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    else:
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins using the adjusted bin_edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Correct the labels based on the closed and label parameters
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # Handle NaN values in the index
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels to match the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the function handles ambiguous timestamps correctly and generates the labels and bins according to the expected output. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
