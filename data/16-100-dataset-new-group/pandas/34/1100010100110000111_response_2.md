## Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an "AmbiguousTimeError" on a clock change day in Cuba. The test is failing when trying to group data using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')` on a datetime index with time data localized to the 'America/Havana' timezone.

The bug seems to be related to how the `_get_time_bins` function handles time data that is localized in a timezone with ambiguous timestamps due to daylight saving time or other reasons. The error message, the failing test, and the GitHub issue suggest that the function is not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the "AmbiguousTimeError."

## Bug Fix Strategy
To handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, the bug fix should involve adjusting the `date_range` function used in the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times, specifically by setting the argument `ambiguous` to a proper value. The `ambiguous` argument in the `date_range` function is used to handle ambiguous times, and setting it to "NaT" can help to handle this issue.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # existing code...

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Set ambiguous times to NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    # existing code...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By setting the `ambiguous` argument to "NaT" in the `date_range` function call, we can handle ambiguous times correctly and avoid the "AmbiguousTimeError" on clock change days in Cuba. This fix should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
