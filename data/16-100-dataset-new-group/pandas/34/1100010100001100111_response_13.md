The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing issues with the grouping of time series data when there are ambiguous timestamps due to a clock change. The source of the bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the `start` and `end` parameters for the `date_range` function, leading to incorrect label generation.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to properly handle ambiguous time points, particularly during the clock change day. This can be addressed by refining the way `start` and `end` timestamps are generated in the `date_range` function, ensuring that the labels are correctly aligned with the expected output of the grouping operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min().floor(self.freq), ax.max().ceil(self.freq)

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `first` and `last` timestamps are generated by adjusting the timestamps to align them with the frequency using the `floor` and `ceil` functions. This should address the issue related to ambiguous time points during the clock change day, resulting in correct grouping labels.

This revised version of the function ensures that the generated labels are aligned with the expected output of the grouping operation, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
