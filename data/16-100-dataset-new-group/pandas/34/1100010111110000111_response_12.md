The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `groupby` with daily frequency on clock change days in Cuba. The key issue is related to handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days, and is associated with the use of `pd.Grouper`.

To resolve this bug, we need to address the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `date_range` function used in the `_get_time_bins` function. Additionally, further adjustments may be necessary to correctly form the groups based on the available timestamps.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Preserve timezone
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use the `floor` and `ceil` methods to handle the first and last timestamps, ensuring that they align with the frequency, and addressing potential ambiguity.
2. The date range is formed with the correct start and end points, considering the timezone (retain original timezone).
3. The generated labels are adjusted according to the number of bins.

With these adjustments, the corrected function should handle ambiguous timestamps more effectively and form the time bins correctly. After applying this fix, the failing test and the associated GitHub issue should be resolved.
