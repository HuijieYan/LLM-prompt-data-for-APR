## Potential error locations within the buggy function

One potential error in the buggy function is related to the handling of ambiguous time in the `date_range` call. This impacts the grouping of time intervals and can lead to potential errors.

## Explanation of the bug

The bug causes a `TypeError` or `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency that fails on a clock change day in Cuba due to ambiguous timestamps. The root cause of the bug is in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which mishandles the resolution of ambiguous timestamps generated by the `date_range` call. This leads to incorrect grouping and results in the error described in the GitHub issue.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

The strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the `_get_time_bins` method to handle ambiguous timestamps properly. This can be achieved by explicitly providing the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` call to handle ambiguous times based on the given timezone.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # other parts of the function remain the same

    # Use date_range with ambiguous parameter to handle ambiguous times
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # set to NaT for handling ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # other parts of the function remain the same
```

In the corrected version, the `ambiguous` parameter for the `date_range` function is set to "NaT" to handle ambiguous times produced by clock changes. This correction should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report by properly handling ambiguous timestamps during the grouping process.
