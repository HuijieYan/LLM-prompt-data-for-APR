## Bug Analysis
The bug is occurring when performing a groupby operation with daily frequency on a long clock-change day in Cuba, which creates an ambiguous timestamp for midnight local time. The `pd.Grouper()` function does not handle this situation correctly, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The issue is related to the iteration over the timestamps in the `DatetimeIndex` and not being correctly adjusted to handle the ambiguous time on the clock-change day.

The failing test sample provided demonstrates the problem. The expected output is to have three groups (one for each day: 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), with the 4th of November containing the 25 hourly data points for that day, properly labeled with the timestamp '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00'.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function inside the `TimeGrouper` class needs to be updated to handle the ambiguous timestamp created on the clock-change day in a way that aligns with the expected output. The adjustment to properly handle this situation on the 4th of November is essential for resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` and generating the correct grouping of the data.

For the correction, the adjustment related to the clock-change day can be handled by implementing logic that addresses the ambiguous timestamp directly by ensuring the correct labels are assigned to the grouped data.

## Corrected Version
```python
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT, Period, Timestamp
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range
import pandas as pd

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]  # Adjust labels to exclude the first entry
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The correction involves updating the logic for assigning labels to the groups based on the behavior expected during the clock-change day. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and ensure that the grouping of data is performed correctly, aligning with the expected output.
