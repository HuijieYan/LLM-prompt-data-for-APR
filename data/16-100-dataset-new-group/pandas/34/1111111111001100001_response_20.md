The issue appears to be related to the handling of timezone information in the `DateRange` generation and adjustments within the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The bug seems to be causing incorrect bin and label assignments when generating date ranges based on input time values and timezone information.

The problem may stem from the usage of timezone information during the date range generation, specifically when dealing with Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions, resulting in incorrect bin and label assignments.

To fix this bug, the implementation needs to account for the effects of DST transitions on bin and label assignments when generating the date range. This might involve adjusting the bin and label assignments based on any potential discontinuities in the time domain due to DST transitions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected implementation:
1. We are using the first and last elements of the input DatetimeIndex directly to calculate the `first` and `last` values, and we are incrementing the `last` value by one day. This should help in addressing any issues related to DST transitions.
2. The date range generation now accounts for potential DST transitions and discontinuities in the time domain.
3. We still adjust the labels to match the bins, and we handle any NaN values appropriately.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should be able to generate accurate bins and labels even in scenarios involving DST transitions.

After applying these modifications, the test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should pass successfully.
