The error is caused by the use of ambiguous local time during the transition from standard time to daylight saving time, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The issue described in the GitHub post "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba" refers to a specific instance of this error in the `groupby` function, where it fails to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

The bug appears to be related to the generation of binner/labels using the `date_range` function, which doesn't account for the ambiguity of timestamps during the transition from standard time to daylight saving time. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when the `groupby` function is invoked on the dataframe containing the ambiguous timestamps.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function should handle ambiguous timestamps with more consideration, possibly by using a different method to generate binner/labels that accounts for the ambiguity during the transition between standard time and daylight saving time.

Here's a corrected version of the function that addresses the ambiguity in timestamps using the `date_range` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = pd.date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT"  # Handle ambiguous times by setting them to NaT
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `date_range` function is used with the `ambiguous="NaT"` parameter to handle ambiguous times by setting them to NaT instead of raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This addresses the bug and ensures that the `groupby` function no longer fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError` when used on dataframes containing ambiguous timestamps.
