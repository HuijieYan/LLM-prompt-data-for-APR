The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` is causing the `groupby` with daily frequency to fail with an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change day in Cuba. The issue arises due to the fact that on the long clock-change day in Cuba, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, and the function `pd.Grouper` is not handling it correctly.

The bug can be traced to the incorrect handling of the timestamp range edges `first` and `last`, which results in an incorrect distribution of the time bins, especially around the time of the clock change. This causes the `AmbiguousTimeError` when the `groupby` function is called with daily frequency.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the timestamp range edges `first` and `last` are adjusted properly to account for the ambiguous timestamp on the clock-change day. This can be achieved by revising the logic for calculating the `first` and `last` timestamps, and the way the `bin_edges` are adjusted.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function, ensuring that the time bins are distributed correctly, taking into account the ambiguous timestamp for the clock change day:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Revised logic for calculating first and last timestamps
    adjusted_start = ax[0].tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz).normalize()
    adjusted_end = ax[-1].tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz).normalize() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        adjusted_start, adjusted_end, self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By revising the calculation of the `first` and `last` timestamps to account for the ambiguous timestamp on the clock-change day, the corrected function ensures that the time bins are distributed correctly without causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
