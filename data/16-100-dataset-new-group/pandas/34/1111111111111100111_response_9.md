Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class in `pandas/core/resample.py` is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when the `groupby` function is called with a daily frequency.

The cause of the bug is related to how the `binner` and `labels` are being generated, particularly on days when there is a clock change, resulting in ambiguous times that lead to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to adjust the creation of `binner` and `labels` to handle ambiguous times during clock changes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, changes have been made to handle ambiguous times during clock changes by using the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter in the `date_range` function, and by ensuring that the `bins` and `labels` are appropriately adjusted.

By implementing these changes, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` passes as expected.
