The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file is causing an AmbiguousTimeError when attempting to group data using `pd.Grouper` for daily frequency on a clock-change day in Cuba. This bug is leading to incorrect binning and labeling when handling ambiguous timestamps generated due to the clock change on that day.

The bug is likely in the logic for generating `binner` and `labels` in the `_get_time_bins` function. The current logic does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an incorrect configuration of bins and labels, which triggers the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to properly handle ambiguous timestamps during the binning and labeling process. This can be achieved by considering the unique conditions during clock changes and ensuring that the timestamps are correctly categorized into the appropriate bins.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Proper handling of ambiguous timestamps
    # Generate the binner and labels with correct time zone information
    binner = ax.to_period(self.freq).to_timestamp().tz_localize(ax.tz.zone, ambiguous="infer")
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins considering ambiguous timestamps
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if necessary
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version accounts for handling ambiguous timestamps during the binning and labeling process to ensure that the grouping works correctly, particularly on clock-change days in Cuba. With these updates, the function should no longer trigger the AmbiguousTimeError, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
