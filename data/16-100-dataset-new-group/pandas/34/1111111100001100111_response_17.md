To fix the bug, it's important to identify the root cause. The bug comes from the fact that the input `ax` contains ambiguous times due to the clock change day in Cuba. This causes the buggy function to raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`. 

The issue description mentions that when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency, it should return three groups (one for each day) and when there is an ambiguous time, it should handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the ambiguous timestamps in the input `ax` correctly and ensure that the function returns the expected number of groups. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function with handling ambiguous times and returning the correct number of groups:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        # Handling ambiguous times by removing duplicate timestamps
        ax = ax.drop_duplicates()
        
        # Getting the first and last non-ambiguous timestamps
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected version, ambiguous times are being handled by removing duplicate timestamps and ensuring the correct number of groups are returned. This should address the issue with the daily frequency failing on clock change day in Cuba.
