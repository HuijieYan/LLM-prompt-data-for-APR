The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` and it belongs to the `TimeGrouper` class in the file `pandas/core/resample.py`. The failing test is `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in the test file `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py`. The corresponding error message is `AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times`.

The potential error in the function is that the date range is being created without accounting for daylight saving time (DST), leading to an ambiguous time error. This is likely causing incorrect binning and labels in the output.

The cause of the bug is that when creating the date range, the function is not handling the transition between standard time and daylight saving time. This results in an ambiguous time error because the time range crosses the boundary between standard time and daylight saving time.

To fix the bug, the function should use a method that handles ambiguous times, such as `normalize` or `tz_convert` to handle the transition between standard time and daylight saving time accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]

    first = first.tz_convert(self.freq.tz)
    last = last.tz_convert(self.freq.tz)

    if self.closed == 'left':
        closed = 'left'
        if self.base is not None:
            first = first.normalize()
        binner = date_range(start=first, end=last + 1, freq=self.freq, tz=self.freq.tz)
    else:
        closed = 'right'
        binner = date_range(start=first - 1, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=self.freq.tz)

    # Option: handle daylight saving time transition
    bin_edges = binner[1:]
    # ---- end of option ----

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_edges.asi8, closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected function uses `tz_convert` to handle the transition between standard time and daylight saving time accurately and avoid ambiguous time errors. This should ensure that the date range is created correctly, resolving the issue with incorrect binning and labels.
