The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group data by daily frequency on a day with a time change, such as when daylight saving time starts or ends. This issue has been reported on GitHub, highlighting that the bug causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group time series data for the 24-hour period containing the time change.

The cause of the bug is related to how the `_get_time_bins` function is generating time bins and labels. The issue arises when generating the time range that crosses a daylight saving time transition, resulting in ambiguous local time. This leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to group the data using the `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency.

To resolve this issue, the strategy for fixing the bug should involve updating the logic for generating time bins and labels in a way that handles daylight saving time transitions without causing ambiguous local times.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas.core.resample import Grouper

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax: DatetimeIndex):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        if self.freq.endswith('D'):
            ax -= pd.Timedelta("1s")  # Adjust the end of day by 1 second to avoid ambiguous time error
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=ax.min(),
            end=ax.max(),
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the issue with daylight saving time transitions by adjusting the end of day when the frequency is daily (`'D'`). By subtracting 1 second from the end of the day, it ensures that the time range does not include an ambiguous time, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue reported in the GitHub bug.
