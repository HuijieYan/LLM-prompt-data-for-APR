The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function arises from the incorrect calculation and alignment of the time bins and labels. This results in missing or mismatched values in the `bins` and `labels` arrays. The bug seems to stem from the incorrect use of timestamps and their alignment with the specified frequency.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the time bins and labels are correctly aligned with the frequency provided. One potential strategy would be to use the specified frequency to generate the time bins and labels accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Generate time bins and labels using the specified frequency
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=ax.min(), end=ax.max(), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on the time values
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
By generating the time bins and labels using the specified frequency and adjusting them based on the time values, this correction aims to accurately align the bins and labels, ultimately resolving the bug.
