The bug in the TimeGrouper class (pandas/core/resample.py) is causing a failing test in the `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight()` function (pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py). The function `_get_time_bins()` in the TimeGrouper class is failing to handle the given DatetimeIndex when the index contains an ambiguous timestamp related to a clock change.

The bug is probably occurring during the creation of the `binner` and `labels` variables, which are of type DatetimeIndex. The bug seems to be impacting the midnight timestamp during the clock change and not properly handling the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters.

The bug is reported in a GitHub issue with the title "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba".

To fix this bug, it is necessary to update the logic for creating the `binner` and `labels` variables and ensure that ambiguous timestamps related to the clock change are properly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins()` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins_fixed(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    bins = ax.floor(self.freq, ambiguous='infer', nonexistent='shift_forward')
    index_range = date_range(start=bins.min(), end=bins.max(), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
    bins = bins.union(index_range)

    return bins, bins, index_range
```

In this corrected function, the `bins` variable is created using the `floor` method of the input `ax`, and the timestamp adjustments are handled using the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters. The `index_range` is created using `date_range` method, and the bins and labels are then appropriately returned after resolving the ambiguous timestamps. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
