## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` seems to be related to the issue of grouping with daily frequency failing with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba. The issue mentions that this particular call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError on long clock-change days in Cuba, and the expected output should return three groups for each day, but it fails to do so.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
- The use of timestamps directly without handling ambiguous time, which could potentially lead to an AmbiguousTimeError.
- The adjustment of labels in the function might be causing errors related to ambiguous timestamps.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug seems to be related to not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, especially when it comes to long clock-change days in Cuba.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the timestamps are handled correctly, especially on days with ambiguous time like long clock-change days in Cuba. This might involve handling the timestamps with more care and considering timezone conversions and ambiguous times.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps
    if ax.tz is not None and ax.tz._ambiguous:
        binner, bins, labels = _adjust_for_ambiguous_dates(ax.tz, binner, bins, labels)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, I added a call to `_adjust_for_ambiguous_dates` to handle ambiguous timestamps when the timezone is not None and is ambiguous, ensuring that the bug related to AmbiguousTimeError is addressed.
