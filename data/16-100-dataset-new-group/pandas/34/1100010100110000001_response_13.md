### Analysis
The error message is indicating that the function is encountering an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to infer dst time from a specific date and time.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error in the code seems to be in the `date_range` function call, where the function is attempting to resolve the time ambiguity.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by a complication in handling Daylight Saving Time (DST) changes within the `date_range` function, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way `date_range` creates the range of dates to handle the ambiguity related to DST changes.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # Existing code for type checking remains the same

    # Existing code for handling ax length remains the same

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.tz_localize(None).min(),
        ax.tz_localize(None).max(),
        self.freq,
        closed=self.closed,
        base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Resolving ambiguity using 'infer'
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # The rest of the code remains the same

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, I modified the `date_range` call to explicitly handle time ambiguity by setting the `ambiguous` parameter to "infer", which resolves the ambiguity related to DST changes when creating the date range.
