The bug in this function seems to be related to the handling of daylight saving time transitions, particularly the ambiguity that arises from the transition to and from daylight saving time.

The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is being raised due to the inability to infer the daylight saving time from a specific timestamp. This suggests that the implementation of the function is not handling the transition to and from daylight saving time correctly.

One potential issue is that the `date_range` function is being used to create bins for the time intervals, and this function may not handle daylight saving time transitions appropriately. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the date range is created in a way that handles daylight saving time transitions correctly, and that the bin labels are adjusted accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().tz_localize(None)  # Convert to naive timestamp
    last = ax.max().tz_localize(None)  # Convert to naive timestamp

    binner = []
    labels = []
    
    current_time = first
    while current_time <= last:
        binner.append(current_time)
        labels.append(current_time)
        current_time += self.freq
    
    binner = DatetimeIndex(binner, name=ax.name, freq=self.freq)
    labels = DatetimeIndex(labels, name=ax.name, freq=self.freq)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the date range is constructed using a loop, ensuring that the transition to and from daylight saving time is handled correctly. Additionally, the bin labels are adjusted based on the number of bins created. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and correctly handle the time interval grouping.
