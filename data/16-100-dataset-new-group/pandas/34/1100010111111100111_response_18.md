The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely causing the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to error out with the `AmbiguousTimeError` when the code is invoked. The issue on GitHub suggests that the problem occurs on a clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp.

In the failing test, the `ax` parameter is a `DatetimeIndex` that was created using `pd.date_range()`, then localized to "UTC" and converted to "America/Havana" time zone. The `self.freq` parameter is set to `<Day>`, `self.closed` is set to `'left'`, and `self.label` is set to `'left'`. These parameters are then used within the `_get_time_bins` function to create `binner` and `labels` `DatetimeIndex` objects, which are further adjusted based on the `ax` values to generate `bins`.

The error occurs due to the ambiguous time at midnight on the day of the time change. The `binner` and `labels` indices are being created with ambiguous timestamps, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to identify and handle the ambiguous time at the point of time change in the specified time zone.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function to handle the ambiguous time:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    if ax[0].is_dst != ax[-1].is_dst:
        # Identify the switch from Standard Time to Daylight Saving Time
        switch_idx = np.argmax(ax.is_dst != ax.is_dst[0])
        
        # Based on the switch, adjust the initial and final timestamps
        first, last = ax[switch_idx], ax[switch_idx + 1]

        # Create the binner and labels without using date_range to handle the ambiguous time
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex([first, last], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name).union(ax)
        
    else:
        # No ambiguous time, proceed with original logic
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this fix, it checks for the presence of an ambiguous time at the point of the time change in the specified time zone and handles it accordingly. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` when using the specific test case and address the issue described on GitHub.
