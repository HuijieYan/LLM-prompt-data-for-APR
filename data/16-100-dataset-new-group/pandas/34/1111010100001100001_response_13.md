The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be occurring due to the incorrect calculation of the `binner` and `labels` variables. The issue is associated with generating the time bins and labels using the `date_range` function, as well as the adjustment of bin edges in the `_adjust_bin_edges` method based on the input `ax_values` and `binner`.

The incorrect calculation of the `binner` and `labels` variables might be causing the function to return invalid values, leading to an error. Additionally, the adjustment of bin edges in the `_adjust_bin_edges` method might not be functioning as expected, resulting in incorrect bin and label values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `binner` and `labels` are calculated accurately using the `date_range` function and that the bin edges are correctly adjusted in the `_adjust_bin_edges` method.

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        normalize=True,
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    binner, labels = binner[1:], labels[1:]  # adjust after slicing

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the issues related to the calculation of `binner` and `labels` and the adjustment of bin edges. The adjustment of `binner` and `labels` is done using slicing to ensure that the correct number of labels is returned based on the number of bins. Additionally, the `date_range` function is used to calculate the correct `binner` and `labels` values.
