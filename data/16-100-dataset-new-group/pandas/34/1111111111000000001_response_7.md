The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The function checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex` and then proceeds to perform some operations to calculate the time bins.

The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is in the logic used to calculate the time bins, especially when dealing with daylight saving time transitions.

The cause of the bug could be related to how the function calculates the time bins in the presence of daylight saving time transitions, which may result in incorrect bin edges and labels.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing the logic for calculating the time bins, especially around the handling of daylight saving time transitions. Additionally, thorough testing with different time intervals and time zones that have daylight saving time transitions would be necessary to ensure the correctness of the calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max() + self.freq if self.closed == "right" else ax.freq
    labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        closed=self.closed,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        bins = labels.shift(1, freq=self.freq)
        labels = labels[:-1] if self.label == "right" else labels
    else:
        bins = labels
        labels = labels[1:] if self.label == "right" else labels

    return bins, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we have simplified the logic for calculating the time bins and labels, and also handled the case of daylight saving time transitions more effectively. This should address the potential issues related to daylight saving time transitions and ensure correct time bin calculations.
