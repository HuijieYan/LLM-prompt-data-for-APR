The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely causing a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` when calling the `date_range` function. This is likely due to the use of a DatetimeIndex with localization, and the function might not be handling a change in daylight saving time properly.


To fix this bug, one strategy could be to identify the specific time range where this error occurs and handle it explicitly by adding additional logic to handle scenarios where timestamps are ambiguous due to daylight saving time changes.

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    try:
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
    except pytz.AmbiguousTimeError:
        # Handle the case where the timestamps are ambiguous due to DST
        # For example, manually adjust the first and last timestamps
        first = first - pd.Timedelta(minutes=30)
        last = last + pd.Timedelta(minutes=30)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
}
```

In the corrected version, an exception handling is added to catch the `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` when calling the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function, allowing for specific handling of this scenario. This way, timestamps that are ambiguous due to daylight saving time changes can be adjusted manually before creating the date range, potentially resolving the `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` that was previously occurring.
