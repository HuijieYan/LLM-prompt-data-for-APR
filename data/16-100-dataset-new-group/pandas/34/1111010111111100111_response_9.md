The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class is causing an AmbiguousTimeError when attempting to group time intervals during a clock change day in Cuba.

The bug occurs because the date_range function is used to generate time bins, and it does not handle the daylight saving time (DST) transition in the context of local time zone conversions. This causes the generated time bins to be slightly mismatched with the actual data, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, the date_range function should be replaced with a more robust method that handles DST transitions correctly when generating time bins.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    bins = ax.floor(self.freq, ambiguous='NaT')
    labels = bins + to_offset(self.freq)
    
    return bins, bins, labels
```

By using the `floor` method to generate time bins while specifying `ambiguous='NaT'` to handle ambiguous times, the corrected function should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError during time grouping.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the groupby call to return the expected groups without raising an AmbiguousTimeError.
