The issue here seems to be related to the handling of Daylight Saving Time (DST) changes in the `pandas` library. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is related to grouping by day while considering the time zone changes, and it fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to DST transition.

Looking at the `pandas/core/resample.py` file and the `_get_time_bins` function, the cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of DST or time zone changes when creating the bins and labels for resampling.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve ensuring that the date ranges and labels are correctly adjusted to account for any DST transitions within the provided time range. This may involve using functionality available in the `pandas` library to handle time zone changes and DST transitions when creating the bins and labels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust the start and end timestamps to account for time zone and DST changes
    start = ax[0].tz_localize(None)
    end = ax[-1].tz_localize(None)
    bin_range = date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz)

    # Generate bins based on the adjusted time range
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_range.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    # Return the bins as labels for resampling
    return bin_range, bins, bin_range
```

In this corrected version, the function takes into account time zone changes and DST transitions when creating the bins and labels for resampling. It adjusts the start and end timestamps to consider the time zone using `tz_localize` and then uses the adjusted time range to generate the bins.

By making these adjustments, the function should handle time zone changes and DST transitions correctly, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` that caused the failing test.
