The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` is causing the error `pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times`. This error is occurring when a daily frequency is used in the `groupby` operation with a time zone that has ambiguous transition times, such as Cuba. The issue on GitHub confirms that the bug is causing the `pd.Grouper` to fail with an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba.

The cause of the bug is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating bins for the groupby operation. The function `_get_time_bins` does not handle ambiguous times correctly, leading to the error when the `groupby` is performed with daily frequency.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle ambiguous times when creating the bins for grouping.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use the day time component of the timestamp to avoid issues with ambiguous timestamps
    ax_day = ax.map(lambda x: x.normalize())

    # Get unique day timestamps after removing duplicates from the ambiguous transition day
    days = ax_day.drop_duplicates()

    first, last = days.min(), days.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we use the day time component of the timestamp to avoid issues with ambiguous timestamps. We then get the unique day timestamps after removing duplicates from the ambiguous transition day. This approach ensures that the days are properly identified without being affected by ambiguous transitions, preventing the AmbiguousTimeError in the `groupby` operation.
