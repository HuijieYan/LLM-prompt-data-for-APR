Potential error locations within the `_get_time_bins` function:
1. The `binner` and `labels` variables are mistakenly assigned the result of the `date_range` function call, which could be incorrect.
2. Adjustment of bin edges might not be correctly handled, leading to incorrect binning of the data.
3. The handling of labels and bins based on the frequency and closed values may not be correct.
4. Handling of NaN values seems to be incorrect.

Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect assignment of `binner` and `labels` in the `_get_time_bins` function. This leads to an incorrect grouping when applying `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency when there is an ambiguous timestamp due to a clock change. The incorrect assignment of `labels` and `binner` in `_get_time_bins` function seems to be at the heart of the issue and leads to `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the DataFrame.

Suggestion for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the handling of `binner` and `labels` assignment in the `_get_time_bins` function.
2. Ensure that the bin edges are correctly adjusted.
3. Carefully handle the selection of labels based on the frequency and closed values.
4. Properly handle NaN values and adjust labels if necessary.

Corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function addresses the incorrect assignment of `binner` and `labels`, ensures the correct adjustment of bin edges, handles labels correctly based on frequency and closed values, and properly deals with NaN values. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
