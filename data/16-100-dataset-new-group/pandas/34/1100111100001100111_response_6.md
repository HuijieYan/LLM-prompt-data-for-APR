The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps in Cuba due to clock changes. This bug causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised when attempting to group data with a daily frequency, as explained in the GitHub issue.

The problematic line of code is likely the creation of the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, where the `ambiguous` parameter is set to "infer". This is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the ambiguous timestamp when transitioning between standard and daylight saving time in Cuba.

To fix this issue, the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function should be explicitly set to "NaT". This change should help address the handling of ambiguous timestamps in Cuba.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # ... (existing code)

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Explicitly set ambiguous parameter to "NaT"
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    # ... (remaining code)
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

By setting the `ambiguous` parameter to "NaT", this correction should address the handling of ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue described on GitHub.
