To fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function, we need to address the issue with ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time changes, particularly in the context of the provided failing test. 

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is designed to check if the resampling process correctly handles the transition from daylight saving time, which occurs on November 4th, 2018, at midnight in the local time zone "America/Havana". 

The input data for this test includes a DateTimeIndex representing hourly data from November 3rd to November 5th, 2018, localized to "America/Havana" time zone. When the resampling operation is performed with a frequency of "1D", it should correctly handle the ambiguous transition hour on the daylight saving time change date (November 4th, 2018).

The failing test provides details about the specific error encountered, which is an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This error occurs due to ambiguous timestamps that cannot be unambiguously mapped to a single UTC timestamp during the daylight saving time transition. This indicates that the resampling process is not correctly handling the ambiguous timestamps during the transition period.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the resampling process takes into account the potential for ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time transitions. Specifically, the `date_range` function should handle the ambiguous times based on the provided local time zone. We'll need to make adjustments to ensure that the timestamps are correctly adjusted during the daylight saving time transition, and that the resulting labels and bins are accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use the provided local time zone for the date_range function
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Assuming the rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In this corrected version, we specify the time zone `tz=ax.tz` when calling the `date_range` function. This allows the date range to handle the ambiguous timestamps during the daylight saving time transition based on the provided local time zone, while ensuring that the resulting labels and bins are correctly adjusted.

By implementing this fix, the resampling process should be able to handle the ambiguous timestamps during the daylight saving time transition, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
