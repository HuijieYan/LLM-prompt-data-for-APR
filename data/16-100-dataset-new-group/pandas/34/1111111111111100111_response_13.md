The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days in certain timezones. The issue arises when the call to `groupby` raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` because `pd.Grouper` does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_time_bins` is not properly handling the transition on clock change days in certain timezones. This results in an incorrect determination of the start and end times, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when calling `groupby`. The error arises because the function fails to handle the daylight saving time transition correctly, specifically for ambiguous timestamps.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be updated to handle the transitions on clock change days in timezones that observe daylight saving time. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for determining the start and end times and handling ambiguous timestamps appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Determine start and end times while handling ambiguous timestamps
    start = ax.tz_localize(None).normalize()
    end = ax.tz_localize(None).normalize() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged...
}
```

By updating the logic to handle the transitions on clock change days, the corrected function should now properly determine the start and end times and handle ambiguous timestamps, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when calling `groupby`. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
