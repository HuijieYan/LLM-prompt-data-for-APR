The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the handling of an ambiguous timestamp during a clock change day in Cuba. The code does not handle this situation correctly, which leads to the error.

To fix this bug, we need to address how the `binner` and `labels` are created and handle the ambiguous timestamp appropriately. The issue on GitHub provides valuable insights and details on the expected behavior and the error encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        # Handle empty case
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the first and last timestamps directly
    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]

    # Ensure the freq is set to the specified frequency
    freq = self.freq

    # Handle the ambiguous timestamp by using the 'infer' parameter for nonexistent
    # and ambiguous, which will infer the correct behavior for ambiguous times
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first - freq, end=last, freq=freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on the provided parameters
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Handle label positions based on the closed and label parameters
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if there are more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version:
- The first and last timestamps are obtained directly from the `DatetimeIndex` `ax` instead of using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function to avoid potential issues with nanosecond parts on clock change days.
- The `date_range` function now includes the `ambiguous="infer"` and `nonexistent="shift_forward"` parameters to handle ambiguous times appropriately.
- `binner` and `labels` are created based on the relevant parameters, and the labels are adjusted if there are more labels than bins.

With these changes, the corrected function should now handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly and resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` reported in the GitHub issue.
