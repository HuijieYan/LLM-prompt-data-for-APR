The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is intended to get the time bins for the given DatetimeIndex `ax`. The error message `AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times` suggests that there is an issue with inferring DST (Daylight Saving Time) from the datetime index, leading to an ambiguous time error.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of daylight saving time when creating the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. The code does not properly handle transitions in time that occur due to daylight saving time, leading to an ambiguous time error.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should handle the daylight saving time transitions properly. This can be done by ensuring that the `date_range` function accounts for daylight saving time transitions when creating the `binner` and `labels`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    bins, binner_idx = lib.generate_bins_dts(
        ax.asi8, self.freq, self.closed, tz=ax.tz)
    binner = ax.take(binner_idx)
    labels = binner + self.offset

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the function `lib.generate_bins_dts` is used to generate the time bins, taking into account the daylight saving time transitions. The function `ax.take(binner_idx)` is used to create the `binner` based on the generated bins, and then the `labels` are adjusted by adding the necessary offset.

With this correction, the function should properly handle daylight saving time transitions, avoiding the ambiguous time error.
