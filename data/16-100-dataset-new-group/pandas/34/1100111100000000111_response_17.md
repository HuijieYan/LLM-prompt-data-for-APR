Looking at the bug and the related GitHub issue, it seems that the problem arises from the way pd.Grouper handles ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock change days in certain time zones like Cuba.

The issue reported on GitHub describes a scenario where a long clock change day in Cuba causes an AmbiguousTimeError when using pd.Grouper with daily frequency. This error arises when the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError due to ambiguous timestamps related to the clock change.

To fix this bug, the _get_time_bins function should be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps, especially on clock change days, in a way that prevents the AmbiguousTimeError from occurring.

To resolve this issue, the corrected version of the _get_time_bins function should handle ambiguous timestamps by adjusting the bin edges and labels to account for ambiguous times on clock change days in the specified time zone.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_time_bins function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Adjust ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Adjust nonexistent times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the date_range function includes adjustments for ambiguous times and nonexistent times by setting the 'ambiguous' and 'nonexistent' arguments accordingly.

This should handle the issue reported in the GitHub bug regarding the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days.
