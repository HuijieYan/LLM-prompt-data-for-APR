The issue relates to the groupby function with daily frequency failing with an AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba. The failing test, `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, creates a datetime index with hourly frequency in the UTC timezone and then converts it to the 'America/Havana' timezone. The groupby operation with a daily frequency (`freq='1D'`) raises an AmbiguousTimeError due to the ambiguous timestamp at midnight on the clock change day.

The bug is likely located in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The function attempts to generate time bins and labels for the groupby operation, and it seems to be failing to handle the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle the ambiguous timestamp at midnight on the clock change day in the specified timezone. One possible strategy is to detect the presence of ambiguous times in the datetime index and handle them appropriately when generating the time bins and labels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps on the clock change day
    ambiguous_times = ax.tz.localize(NaT).tz_localize(ax.tz).to_series().index

    # Generate time bins and labels, handling ambiguous timestamps
    binner, labels = _time_to_bins_labels(
        ax,
        ax.freq,
        closed=self.closed,
        base=self.base,
        ambiguous_times=ambiguous_times,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the function `_time_to_bins_labels` is used to handle the ambiguous timestamps on the clock change day when generating time bins and labels. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the groupby operation with daily frequency works correctly, resolving the AmbiguousTimeError.
