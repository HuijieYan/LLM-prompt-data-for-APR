The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing an AmbiguousTimeError in a specific use case where there is a long clock-change day, such as in Cuba. The issue is related to handling timestamps before and after the clock change. The function currently fails to handle this correctly and raises an AmbiguousTimeError.

The bug appears to be related to how the function constructs the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, and how it adjusts the bin edges. Additionally, the function does not handle ambiguous time situations, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to properly handle the ambiguous time on the clock-change day. One approach could be to adjust the bin edges and labels to account for the ambiguous time, ensuring that the groupby operation returns the expected results without raising the AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the `first` and `last` values are obtained directly from the input `ax`. Then, the `date_range` function is used to create the `binner` with the `ambiguous` parameter set to "infer" to handle ambiguous times. Additionally, the bin edges are adjusted accordingly based on the given frequency. The function also ensures that the labels are adjusted as needed based on the frequency and closed side.

This corrected version of the function should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and handle ambiguous time situations more effectively.
