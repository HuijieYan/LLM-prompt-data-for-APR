The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class is causing a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` when the `groupby` function is called with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. The error occurs because the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to group the data.

The issue stems from the fact that on a clock change day, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, and the `pd.Grouper` is not handling this properly. The expected output is to return three groups (one for each day - 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), where the group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and should contain the 25 hourly data points for that day.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max() - self.freq + pd.Timedelta(days=1)  # Adjust for end of last bin
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Make sure to replace the existing `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class with this corrected version. After implementing this fix, the `groupby` function with a daily frequency should no longer fail with the `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` when run on a clock change day in Cuba.
