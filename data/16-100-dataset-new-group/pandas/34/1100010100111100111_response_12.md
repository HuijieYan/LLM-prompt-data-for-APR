The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the handling of ambiguous time during the daylight saving time transition in the `America/Havana` timezone. The issue is that the `date_range` function does not handle the transition of time during the daylight saving time, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when calling the `groupby` function with a daily frequency.

The main cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function does not handle the transition of time during the daylight saving time, resulting in ambiguous timestamps that raise an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to perform a group operation with a daily frequency.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the transition of time during the daylight saving time explicitly. We can achieve this by using the `tz` parameter of the `date_range` function to localize the start and end timestamps before creating the range.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # existing code

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Handle ambiguous time during daylight saving time transition
    start = ax[0].tz_localize(None)  # localize without preserving the timezone information
    end = ax[-1].tz_localize(None)  # localize without preserving the timezone information
    start = start.tz_localize(ax.tz)
    end = end.tz_localize(ax.tz)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # existing code
```

With this fix, the `date_range` function explicitly handles the transition of time during the daylight saving time by localizing the start and end timestamps without preserving the timezone information. This ensures that ambiguous timestamps are correctly handled, and the `groupby` operation with a daily frequency no longer raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
