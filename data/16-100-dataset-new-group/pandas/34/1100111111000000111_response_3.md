To fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function, it appears to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps when grouping by day in a timezone affected by Daylight Saving Time. The bug is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to inconsistencies in handling ambiguous timestamps.

To resolve this issue, the following steps can be taken:
1. Use a combination of `date_range` and `tz_localize` to create the index with the correct timezone information.
2. Handle ambiguous timestamps by using the `ambiguous` parameter in `date_range`.
3. Ensure that the labels for the groups are created with the correct timezone information.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issues:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use date_range and tz_localize to handle ambiguous timestamps
    binner = date_range(
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        name=ax.name,
    )
    labels = date_range(
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    ...
```

By using `date_range` with the `ambiguous` parameter set to "infer" and including the timezone information, the corrected function can handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping by day in affected timezones. With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
