The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when calling `groupby` with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba.

The issue arises from the fact that the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps properly, leading to an error when trying to group the data by day.

To fix this bug, we need to address the handling of ambiguous timestamps and ensure that the grouping works correctly on clock change days.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().tz_localize(None)
    last = ax.max().tz_localize(None) + self.freq

    binner, bins, labels = [
        arr.tz_localize(ax.tz).tz_localize(None)
        for arr in date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    ]

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This version ensures that the timestamps are properly handled and localized before performing any calculations. It also takes into account the potential existence of ambiguous timestamps, which should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.

By using the corrected version of the function, the `groupby` call on a daily frequency with ambiguous timestamps should now work correctly without raising an error.
