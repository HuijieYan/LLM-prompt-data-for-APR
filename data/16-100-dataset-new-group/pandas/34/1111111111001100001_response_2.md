The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function appears to stem from the incorrect calculation of the `labels` variable, as well as the length comparison between `bins` and `labels`. This causes the failing test since the calculated bins and labels do not align with the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `labels` variable is calculated correctly and aligned with the bins. Additionally, we need to check the comparison between `bins` and `labels` to ensure it is accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    else:  # self.closed == "left"
        labels = binner if self.label == "left" else binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected version should align `labels` with the bins accurately and ensure that the comparison between `bins` and `labels` is done correctly, passing the failing test.
