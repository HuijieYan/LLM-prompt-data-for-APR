The issue with the `TimeGrouper` class stems from the `_get_time_bins` function, which is failing to handle the AmbiguousTimeError when calculating the bins for a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. This bug causes the `groupby` method to raise an AmbiguousTimeError, preventing the expected output from being produced.

The cause of the bug is that the `date_range` method used to calculate the bins and labels is unable to handle the AmbiguousTimeError that occurs on a clock change day. This leads to incorrect binning and labeling, resulting in an error during the `groupby` operation.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the AmbiguousTimeError and ensure that the `date_range` method can accurately calculate the bins and labels even on a clock change day.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bin_edges = self._offset_aware_bins(ax)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, closed=self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = self._create_labels(ax, bin_edges)

    return bin_edges, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we handle the AmbiguousTimeError by creating the bin edges and labels using the `_offset_aware_bins` and `_create_labels` methods. This ensures that the bins and labels accurately represent the time intervals, even on a clock change day.

With the corrected `_get_time_bins` function, the `groupby` method should no longer raise the AmbiguousTimeError, allowing the expected output to be produced as intended.
