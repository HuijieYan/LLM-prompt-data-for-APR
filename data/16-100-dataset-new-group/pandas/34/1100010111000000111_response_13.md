Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/resample.py

# this is the corrected function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        # Use the appropriate fill_value for the Index type
        binner = binner.insert(0, 0, fill_value=NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, 0, fill_value=NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Explanation:
1. The bug related to the function has been identified from the failing test, which is a test case meant to handle daylight saving time changes.
2. The bug causes an AmbiguousTimeError when handling time zone conversions that involve daylight saving time changes.
3. The bug is caused by incorrectly handling ambiguous timestamps, leading to unexpected errors when grouping data.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug includes properly handling ambiguous timestamps and adjusting the labels and bins accordingly.
5. The corrected version of the function addresses the existing issues with handling ambiguous timestamps and ensures that the grouping of data is done correctly, without raising any errors related to ambiguous time.

I've made the necessary changes to handle ambiguous time and inserted the appropriate fill_value for the Index type. With these adjustments, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
