The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the TimeGrouper class and is used to obtain the time bins for a given DatetimeIndex. The error message indicates that an AmbiguousTimeError is being raised, specifically due to an issue when converting the time zone.

The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function includes the conversion of the time zone using `date_range()` function and the adjustments made to the labels and bins based on the frequency.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of the time zone conversion, resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError during the grouping operation. This can be attributed to how the time zones are being handled when generating the time bins.

To fix the bug, we can update the time zone handling during the creation of time bins and labels to ensure that the conversion is performed in a non-ambiguous manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Create the date range by explicitly using UTC, then convert to the desired time zone
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first.tz_localize("UTC").tz_convert(ax.tz),
        end=last.tz_localize("UTC").tz_convert(ax.tz),
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version explicitly handles the time zone conversions by first localizing to UTC and then converting to the time zone of the original DatetimeIndex. This should address the AmbiguousTimeError that was previously raised.
