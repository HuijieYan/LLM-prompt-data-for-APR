The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be stemming from the way it computes the `first` and `last` values, particularly with regards to handling time zones, and the subsequent operations involving these values. The incorrect computation of `first` and `last` affects the subsequent generation of `binner` and `labels`, causing discrepancies in the returned values of `binner` and `labels` as compared to the actual range represented by the `ax` input.

Given the input values and the resulting variables right before the return, it's clear that there's an issue with the computation of `binner`, `labels`, and `bin_edges` after obtaining `first` and `last`. This discrepancy, among other things, points to a potential bug in the computation and creation of these variables.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve revisiting the logic for obtaining `first` and `last` from the given `ax`, particularly taking into account the handling of time zones. Additionally, the subsequent computation and creation of `binner`, `labels`, and `bin_edges` should be reviewed to ensure their consistency with the input `ax`, `first`, and `last`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax[0], ax[-1]
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we've updated the computation of `first` and `last` by directly retrieving the first and last elements of the `ax` input. Additionally, the creation of `binner` and `labels` is revised to ensure it accurately represents the time range of the input `ax` without incorrect time zone or frequency conversions.
