The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to handling time zone conversions and daylight saving time transitions. This is evident from the error message which states "Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times." The error occurs when the function attempts to create date labels using `date_range` with different time zone offsets, leading to ambiguous time errors.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the time zone transitions are handled properly and date labels are generated without ambiguity.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_utc = ax.tz_localize(None)  # Convert to UTC to avoid DST ambiguity
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax_utc.min(), ax_utc.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=None,  # Create date labels in UTC to avoid DST ambiguity
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax_utc.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we convert the input DatetimeIndex to UTC using `tz_localize(None)` to avoid DST ambiguity. When creating date labels using `date_range`, we also set the timezone to None to ensure that the labels are generated in UTC. This should address the ambiguity issue and prevent the "AmbiguousTimeError" from occurring.

Please note that this is a potential fix based on the analysis provided. It is essential to thoroughly test the corrected function to ensure that it resolves the issue without introducing new bugs.
