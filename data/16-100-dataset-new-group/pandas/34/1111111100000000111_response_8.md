### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with other components

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. This class is responsible for custom groupby operations on time-interval grouping.

The `_get_time_bins` function is utilized to obtain time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex. The code sample provided in the GitHub issue triggers this function through the `groupby` operation, and it results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when handling the "Cuba clock change day" scenario.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function

The main area of concern within the `_get_time_bins` function is the generation of bins and labels using the `date_range` function, especially when dealing with ambiguous time points caused by clock changes.

### Cause of the bug

The `date_range` function is not handling the ambiguous time points caused by clock changes appropriately, which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

The fix should involve adjusting the generation of bins and labels to properly account for ambiguous time points caused by clock changes. Additionally, the entire `_get_time_bins` function logic should be reviewed to ensure comprehensive handling of all corner cases involving time-based data.

### Corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Generate the bins and labels with proper handling of ambiguous time points
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous time points
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Handle nonexistent time points
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function's logic remains the same
}
```

In the corrected version, adjustments have been made to the `date_range` function call to handle ambiguous and nonexistent time points appropriately. Additionally, it is recommended to review the entire `TimeGrouper` class implementation for any additional handling required for time-based data operations.
