The bug in the provided function lies in the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` variables. It is causing the output to be incorrect, leading to test failure. The issue seems to be with the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` when there are datetime shifts due to timezone changes, as seen in the failing test case.

The `date_range` function is used to calculate `binner` and `labels` based on the `first` and `last` timestamps. However, when there are transitions between timezones (due to DST changes), the `date_range` function does not handle it correctly.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the calculation of `binner` and `labels` when there are timezone shifts. This can be achieved by using a different approach to calculate `binner` and `labels` that takes into account the timezone changes. The `date_range` function does not handle timezone transitions correctly, so we need to find an alternative solution.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(
            data=pd.date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz),
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, `binner` and `labels` are calculated using the `pd.date_range` function with the `tz` parameter, which takes into account the timezone changes. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
