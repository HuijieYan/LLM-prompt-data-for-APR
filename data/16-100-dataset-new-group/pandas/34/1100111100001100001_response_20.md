The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the creation of the `binner` and `labels` variables as `DatetimeIndex` objects. It appears that the combination of `freq`, `start`, and `end` parameters in the `date_range` function is not correctly capturing the full range of the input DatetimeIndex, resulting in incorrect labels and bins being generated.

It's important to note that the timestamps within the `ax` variable are in varying timezones, which is consistent with the value of `ax.tz` being `'America/Havana'`. This makes it crucial to ensure that the timezones are correctly handled to prevent issues with the time binning.

To fix the bug, we can use the `ax.min()` and `ax.max()` timestamps directly as start and end parameters in the `date_range` function, making sure to keep the timezone information intact. Additionally, we should ensure that the frequency `freq` is correctly applied and that the resulting `binner` and `labels` cover the full range of the input `ax` DatetimeIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    # Ensure timezone is preserved when creating binner and labels
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    labels = binner[1:]

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This adjustment ensures that the `binner` and `labels` are created to cover the full range of input timestamps and preserve the associated timezone information.
