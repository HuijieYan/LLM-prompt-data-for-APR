To fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function, we need to handle the ambiguous timestamp issue on the clock-change day in Cuba. The code is currently not handling the ambiguous time correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

The cause of the bug is that the code is not accounting for the daylight saving time (DST) transition in Cuba, leading to an ambiguous timestamp error. The failing test case specifically provides a scenario where the timezone conversion results in an ambiguous timestamp error. The code needs to handle this situation by adjusting the bin and label values to account for the DST transition accurately.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly while considering the DST transition. Specifically, when constructing the bins and labels for the datetime index, we need to ensure that the code accounts for the DST transition accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Handle the adjustment for the DST transition
    dst_adjusted_start = ax[0].tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz)
    dst_adjusted_end = ax[-1].tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=dst_adjusted_start,
        end=dst_adjusted_end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the logic remains unchanged
    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated function accounts for the DST transition by adjusting the start and end of the date range for bin and label generation. It should fix the AmbiguousTimeError issue reported in the failing test.

By implementing this change, we ensure that the generation of time bins and labels accounts for the DST transition, preventing the AmbiguousTimeError. After making this adjustment, the `_get_time_bins` function should be able to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly on the clock-change day in Cuba.
