The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `pandas/core/resample.py` file seems to be related to how it handles the transition to daylight saving time (DST). The incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during the transition to DST causes the `groupby` operation to raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The `_get_time_bins` function processes the input `ax` (assuming it's a `DatetimeIndex`) to generate time bins and labels that are then used for grouping. However, on transition days, particularly in locations with DST, this processing does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to incorrect bin and label generation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly. One approach is to detect these ambiguous timestamps during the bin and label generation process and handle them accordingly by adjusting the bins and labels or handling the ambiguous timestamps explicitly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Use the localized indexes to handle ambiguous and nonexistent times
    localized_index = binner.tz_localize(ax_values.tz, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    bins = localized_index.values

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected version, the function now handles ambiguous timestamps using the `tz_localize` method. The localized indexes are used to handle ambiguous and nonexistent times, ensuring that the behavior on transition days is appropriately handled. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the `groupby` operation to work correctly, especially on long clock-change days with ambiguous timestamps.
