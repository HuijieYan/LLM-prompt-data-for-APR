The issue seems to stem from the handling of ambiguous time during a daylight saving time change in Cuba. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is not correctly handling this scenario, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError. The `DatetimeIndex` passed to the function contains timestamps with ambiguous times due to the clock change, causing issues with binning and label assignment.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of `_get_time_bins` to properly handle ambiguous timestamps, particularly when generating the labels and bins for the time intervals. By explicitly handling the ambiguous times during the clock change in Cuba, we can ensure that the grouping operation works as expected and does not raise the AmbiguousTimeError. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Calculate the first and last time edges for the binning
    first = ax.min().ceil('D')
    last = ax.max().floor('D') + Period(self.freq, freq=self.freq)  # Adjust for frequency

    # Generate the bins and labels while handling ambiguous times during the clock change
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="compliant",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward"  # Shift forward for nonexistent times
    )
    
    # Adjust the bin edges based on the binner and ax_values
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins taking into account ambiguous times and closed intervals
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    # Adjust labels based on closed and label settings
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    else:  # Default to "left" 
        labels = binner

    # If the original index contains NaN values, update binner and labels
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Ensure the labels align with the number of bins after potential adjustments
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we adjust the `date_range` call to handle ambiguous times using the `ambiguous="compliant"` setting. Furthermore, we modify the logic to align binner and labels with the bins after making adjustments. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError issue.

Please replace the existing `_get_time_bins` method with this corrected version in the `TimeGrouper` class to address the bug.
