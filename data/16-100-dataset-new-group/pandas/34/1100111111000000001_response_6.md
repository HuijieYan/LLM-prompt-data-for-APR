The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function seems to have a bug in the logic for generating time bins and labels.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for generating `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, as well as the adjustment of `labels` when the `closed` parameter is set to "right".

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the `date_range` function is used to generate `binner` and `labels`, as well as the adjustments made to the `labels` based on the `closed` and `label` parameters.

To fix the bug, we need to rethink the logic for generating `binner` and `labels` and make sure that the adjustments based on the `closed` and `label` parameters are correctly applied.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    # Use frequency to generate bin edges
    bin_edges = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, closed=self.closed, tz=ax.tz)
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(bin_edges, ax_values)

    # Generate bins based on bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on closed and label parameters
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we use the `date_range` function to generate `bin_edges` directly based on the `freq`, `closed`, and `tz` parameters. We then adjust the `labels` based on the `closed` and `label` parameters, and handle cases where there are NaN values in the input index.

This corrected version should address the issues present in the original buggy function.
