### Bug Cause
The bug is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` because the code is not handling the ambiguous timestamp that occurs during the timezone change from UTC to America/Havana. The bug is due to the incorrect handling of the datetime index during tz conversion and the subsequent resampling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the code needs to properly handle the ambiguous timestamps that occur during the timezone change. This can be achieved by updating the code to handle the ambiguous times explicitly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='infer', nonexistent='shift_forward'
    )

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
    # ...
```
In the corrected version of the function, we explicitly set the `ambiguous` argument to `'infer'` in the `date_range` function call. This setting allows pandas to infer the ambiguous times during the timezone conversion and handle them correctly.

By making this change, the code should be able to handle the ambiguous timestamps during the timezone change, thus resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` and allowing the resampling to work correctly.
