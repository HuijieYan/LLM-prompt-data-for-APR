Based on the failing test and the input and output values provided, it seems that the bug is related to handling time zone changes, particularly on days with a clock change. This leads to the AmbiguousTimeError that is raised in the failing test. The error message indicates that the error arises due to the failure to infer the DST time from a specific timestamp.

The problematic code is likely within the `_get_time_bins` function, where it is failing to handle ambiguous time during the clock change in the specified time zone. This can be seen from the labels and binner being set using the `date_range` function, which is not properly considering the ambiguous and nonexistent times when creating the bins for the specified frequency.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to update the handling of ambiguous and nonexistent times when using the `date_range` function to properly account for the time changes. This can be addressed by using the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` functions to ensure that the time zone changes are handled correctly and that ambiguous times are accounted for.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Properly handle the time zone changes and ambiguous times
    binner = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz)._simple_new(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the time zone changes and ambiguous times are properly handled by using the `tz_localize` function to set the time zone and account for the ambiguous times during the clock change. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
