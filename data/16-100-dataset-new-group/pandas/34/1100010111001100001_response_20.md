The issue in the provided code is that it is not handling daylight saving time correctly, resulting in incorrect binning of timestamps. The code fails to adjust the bin edges for DST changes, leading to misalignment between the bins and the labels.

The specific problem arises from the fact that the `date_range` function, used to generate `binner` and `labels`, does not properly handle the transition due to daylight saving time, which results in incorrect bin edges and labels.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to make use of the `normalize` parameter in the `date_range` function, which ensures that the generated dates are returned in normalized form and avoids the creation of ambiguous or nonexistent labels due to daylight saving time transitions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use normalize=True to handle DST changes
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax[0].normalize(),
        end=ax[-1].normalize(),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        normalize=True  # This parameter should handle the issue
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Continue with the rest of the function as is
    # ...
```

By passing `normalize=True` to the `date_range` function, we should mitigate the problem of DST transitions and generate correct bin edges and labels. This should resolve the issue of misalignment in the binning of timestamps, making the function pass the failing test.
