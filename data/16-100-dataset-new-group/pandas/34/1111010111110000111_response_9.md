## Error Analysis
The error occurs within the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class in the pandas library's `core/resample.py` file. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is related to a specific issue experienced with the `pd.Grouper` function in a specific time zone and on specific dates. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` as a result of a clock change day in Cuba. This issue was reported and is known on the pandas GitHub repository, identified as issue #25758.

The specific cause of the bug seems to be related to how pandas handles the local time during the clock change day, which leads to failures in groupby operations as specified in the failing test. Since the issue is due to handling ambiguous timestamp on a clock change day, a strategy for fixing the bug could include adjusting how pandas handles time zone conversion and labeling during such ambiguous times.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_time_bins` needs to be updated to handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly. A potential strategy to fix the bug could be to modify the date range generation to handle the ambiguous timestamp on clock change days more robustly. This could involve properly labeling the date ranges and updating the handling of ambiguous time zones.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=False  # Add this argument to handle the ambiguous time correctly
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function handles the ambiguous timestamp by adding the `normalize=False` argument to the `date_range` function, which helps in handling the ambiguous time correctly.

By implementing this fix, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
