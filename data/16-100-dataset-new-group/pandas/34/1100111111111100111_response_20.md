To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the TimeGrouper's `_get_time_bins` function handles ambiguous time stamps properly, specifically the midnight timestamp on a clock-change day in Cuba.

The bug in the code is related to how the `date_range` function is being used to generate the `binner` and `labels` in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The `end` parameter of the `date_range` is set to `last`, which is being calculated using NaT replacement along with a clock change. This causes the AmbiguousTimeError due to conflicting local times before and after the clock change.

A strategy to fix this bug would be to handle the ambiguous timestamp explicitly, considering it as an extra hour following the clock change. This can be achieved by checking if the date is ambiguous and handling it accordingly when calling `date_range`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous midnight timestamp explicitly
    if last == ax.normalize().max():
        last += pd.Timedelta(hours=1)

    binner, labels, bins = pd.date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the ambiguous midnight timestamp by adding an extra hour if the last timestamp is equivalent to the normalized maximum timestamp. This helps to prevent the AmbiguousTimeError that was occurring during the resampling process.

After implementing this change, the `TimeGrouper` class will handle ambiguous timestamps properly, resolving the issue faced in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
