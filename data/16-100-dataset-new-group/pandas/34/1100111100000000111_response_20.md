## The bug analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class. This function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input `ax`, which is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`. However, in the provided GitHub issue, it seems that the `pd.Grouper` function does not handle ambiguous time stamps on a clock change day.

## Potential error locations
1. The check for the `ax` variable being a `DatetimeIndex` is present, so the bug is not related to the type of input.
2. The calculation of the `first` and `last` variables using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function could be a potential source of error.
3. The usage of `date_range` to define `binner` and `labels` might have issues related to ambiguous time stamps.
4. The subsequent manipulation of `binner` and `labels` based on conditions and `hasnans` might also contribute to the bug.

## Explanation of the bug
It seems that the bug originates from the way the `date_range` function handles ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. This causes the subsequent operations to be based on incorrect timestamps, leading to unexpected errors.

## Suggested strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the generation of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` handles ambiguous timestamps correctly. This might involve using additional parameters or manipulating the input timestamps before creating the range.

## Corrected version
Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Define a tolerance for ambiguous timestamps
    tolerance = pd.Timedelta(1, unit='s')  # 1 second tolerance
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed,  # Use the same closed value as the time grouper
        normalize=True,  # Normalize timestamps to avoid ambiguous values
        tolerance=tolerance  # Use the defined tolerance for ambiguous timestamps
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This correction includes defining a tolerance for ambiguous timestamps and using it in the `date_range` function, along with other relevant parameters to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.
