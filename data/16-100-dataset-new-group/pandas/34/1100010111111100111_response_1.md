The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely causing the failing test. The bug may be related to handling of the time bins on dates when there are changes due to daylight saving time.

The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function may be causing a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group by day, especially on the day of the clock change in Cuba, which leads to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should handle the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change. We can modify the `_get_time_bins` function to consider the possibility of ambiguous time when creating the bins and labels, and handle such cases appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Handle ambiguous time on the day of clock change
    tz = ax.tz
    if tz and tz._zone in getattr(ax, "tz_repeated", ()):
        tz_res = _get_repeated_localized_time(ax, tz)
        unique_values, repeated_mask = tz_res
        bins[repeated_mask] = bins[repeated_mask] - 1

    # Adjust labels based on self.closed and self.label
    labels = _adjust_labels(ax, binner, bins, tz, self.closed, self.label)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we added a section to handle the ambiguous time on the day of a clock change, and adjust the labels based on self.closed and self.label. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError issue and make the function work as expected for the given test case.

Please verify the changes and confirm if the corrected version resolves the issue and passes the failing test.
