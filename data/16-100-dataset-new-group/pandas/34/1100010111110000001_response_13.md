The provided buggy function is the `_get_time_bins` method from the `pandas.core.resample` module. This method is used for obtaining the time bins for resampling operations when dealing with datetime data in pandas.

The cause of the bug can be inferred from the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`. The failing test is trying to resample data using `pd.Grouper` with a frequency of "1D" (1 day), and it includes a datetime range that spans across Daylight Saving Time (DST) changes. The error message mentions an `AmbiguousTimeError` raised by the `pytz.exceptions` module. This suggests that the bug might be related to a problem with handling ambiguous datetime values during the resampling process, particularly when transitioning from standard time to DST (or vice versa) in the timezone.

The primary strategy for fixing this bug should involve improving the handling of ambiguous datetimes when creating the time bins for resampling. This could include adjusting how the time bins are generated and labeled to ensure that ambiguous or transition times are correctly handled without raising errors like `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Given these considerations, a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method is provided below:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    # New code to handle ambiguous datetimes when creating time bins
    binner = date_range(
        start=ax[0],
        end=ax[-1] + self.freq,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        closed=self.closed,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, closed=self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method, the major changes involve using the min and max values of the datetime index `ax` to generate a `binner` with specific start and end points that take DST transitions into account. Additionally, the `ambiguous` parameter is used to handle ambiguous times during the generation of time bins, which should help avoid errors related to ambiguous datetimes.

By making these improvements, the corrected function should no longer raise `AmbiguousTimeError` when used in the failing test case mentioned. This should address the bug caused by the original `_get_time_bins` method and ensure that it passes the failing test.
