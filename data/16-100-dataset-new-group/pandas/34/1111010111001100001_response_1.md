The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. It is intended to create time bins for a given DatetimeIndex. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to group and downsample data by day and mean and is failing to produce the expected output.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The construction of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range`.
2. The adjustment of bin edges.
3. The generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` method.

The cause of the bug is that the construction of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` and the adjustment of bin edges is not handling the datetime range correctly, leading to mismatched bins and labels. This is resulting in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the construction of `binner` and `labels` should be adjusted to ensure the correct representation of time bins. Additionally, the adjustment of bin edges and the generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64` need to be handled carefully to avoid any mismatch.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().normalize()
    last = ax.max().normalize() + self.freq
    freq_str = self.freq.freqstr
    binner = labels = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=freq_str, tz=ax.tz)
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the construction of `binner` and `labels` using `date_range` has been adjusted to ensure the proper representation of time intervals. Additionally, the adjustment of bin edges and the generation of bins have been revised to handle the datetime range correctly.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
