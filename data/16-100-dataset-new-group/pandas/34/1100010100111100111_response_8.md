The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to handling daylight saving time (DST) transitions, specifically on a clock change day in a specific time zone. It leads to the `pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError` error when attempting to group by daily frequency in the given time zone.

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is probably causing this error due to incorrect handling of the daylight saving time transitions when constructing the `binner` and `labels` arrays, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the grouping process.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the `binner` and `labels` arrays are constructed while considering the ambiguity introduced by the clock change day in the specific time zone. This could involve explicitly handling the DST transitions and avoiding the creation of ambiguous timestamps in the arrays.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    if first.tz is not None and last.tz is not None and first.tz != last.tz:
        # Handle different time zones
        first = first.tz_convert(None)
        last = last.tz_convert(None)

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last+Timedelta(days=1),  # Ensure the end includes all data
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `start` and `end` dates for `date_range` are adjusted to ensure that the end timestamp includes all the data. Additionally, it explicitly handles different time zones and avoids creating ambiguous timestamps in the `binner` and `labels` arrays.

This corrected version should address the `pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError` issue reported in the GitHub bug while grouping by daily frequency on clock change days in Cuba (the specific time zone causing the problem).
