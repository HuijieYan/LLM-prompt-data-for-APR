To fix the bug, we need to address the issue with the AmbiguousTimeError when creating time bins for grouping. The problem arises from the handling of ambiguous timestamps on a day with a clock change, such as the one described in the GitHub issue. 

The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle ambiguous times due to the clock change. Specifically, during the time bin creation, the timestamps are not correctly adjusted for the time zone changes on days with DST transitions, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times correctly and ensure proper interpretation of timestamps on days with DST transitions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor("D").tz_convert(None)
    last = ax[-1].ceil("D").tz_convert(None)

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the timestamps are adjusted to account for days with DST transitions, ensuring that ambiguous times are handled correctly.

By making this change, the corrected function should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and fix the grouping issue on days with DST transitions, as described in the GitHub issue.
