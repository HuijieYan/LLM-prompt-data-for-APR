The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing an AmbiguousTimeError in the given GitHub issue. The issue arises when there is an ambiguous timestamp, such as during a clock change day, and the groupby fails to handle it.

The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of timestamps during the clock change day, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, the handling of timestamps and labeling during clock change days needs to be adjusted to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = ax
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version avoids using the `Timestamp` method directly, which should resolve the issue with ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.
