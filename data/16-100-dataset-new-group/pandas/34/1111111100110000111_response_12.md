Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba. The bug occurs when calling the `groupby` with a daily frequency, and it raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the `TimeGrouper` class handles the DatetimeIndex during a clock change day in Cuba. The issue arises due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, particularly when converting timestamps from UTC to the local time zone. As a result, the resampling process fails to handle the ambiguous time properly.

To fix this bug, you can adjust the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class to handle ambiguous timestamps, specifically addressing the scenario on clock change days in Cuba.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other functions)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        # Handle case where start or end is ambiguous
        ambiguous_start = ax[0].tz_localize(None)
        ambiguous_end = ax[-1].tz_localize(None)
        adjusted_start = ambiguous_start.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")
        adjusted_end = ambiguous_end.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            adjusted_start, adjusted_end, self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        # ... (other processing)
```

In this corrected version, we handle ambiguous timestamps by localizing the start and end timestamps in the local time zone and addressing potential ambiguity using the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter when using the `tz_localize` function. This change addresses the bug related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in Cuba.

By making these adjustments to the `_get_time_bins` function, we aim to resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the resampling process works correctly.
