Based on the GitHub issue, the problem arises when there is an ambiguous timestamp created due to the clock change day in Cuba. The bug is likely related to how the `pd.Grouper` handles time intervals when there are ambiguous timestamps. The issue states that the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError in this scenario.

To resolve the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle the ambiguous timestamp issue correctly, which should involve proper handling and labeling of the time intervals. Additionally, the use of `pd.Grouper` in the GitHub issue indicates that the problem may be within the `_get_time_bins` function rather than the related functions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    tz = ax if not ax.tz is None else ax.tz

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    if tz is not None and tz.localize(first) in ax:
        binner = binner.insert(0, tz.localize(first))

    if tz is not None and tz.localize(last) in ax:
        binner = binner.insert(len(binner), tz.localize(last))

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version includes the proper handling of ambiguous timestamps by checking if the timezone is not None and inserting the localized timestamps in the `binner`. Additionally, it ensures that the labels are adjusted accordingly to handle ambiguous timestamps.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
