The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function appears to be related to the creation of the `labels` based on the `self.closed` and `self.label` attributes. This seems to be causing issues with the comparison between `labels` and `bins`, leading to incorrect binning. 

To fix the bug, the logic for creating the `labels` needs to be revised based on the `self.closed` and `self.label` attributes. It's also important to ensure that the correct frequency and timezone information is applied to both `binner` and `labels` during their creation. Additionally, the adjustment of labels when the number of labels exceeds the number of bins should be handled correctly. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
  
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    else:
        labels = binner[:-1] if self.label == "right" else binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version:
1. The `binner` is created based on the specified frequency and timezone information.
2. Adjustments for `labels` are handled based on the values of `self.closed` and `self.label`.
3. The adjustment of labels when the number of labels exceeds the number of bins is handled correctly.
