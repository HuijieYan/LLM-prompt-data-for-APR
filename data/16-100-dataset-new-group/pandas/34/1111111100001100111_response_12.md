The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous time during a clock change day in Cuba, which leads to an AmbiguousTimeError. The issue is described as such in the GitHub issue, and the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of time values related to the clock change day.

Based on the provided information, the buggy function is supposed to generate time bins based on a given frequency and a DatetimeIndex. The issue arises on a long clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. The function is expected to return three groups (one for each day: 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November) and properly handle the ambiguous timestamp.

After analyzing the input and output values, it is clear that the bug is related to the incorrect handling of time zone changes and ambiguous timestamps. The current implementation fails to properly label the group for the 4th of November and handle the ambiguous timestamp.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle ambiguous timestamps properly, especially during the clock change day in Cuba. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for generating time bins and handling labels.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.resolution

    if first.tz is None:
        first = ax.tz_localize('UTC')
    first = first.tz_convert(ax.tz).replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

    last = ax.resolution

    if last.tz is None:
        last = ax.tz_localize('UTC')
    last = last.tz_convert(ax.tz).replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last + self.freq,  # increase the end time by the frequency to include the last interval
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    bins, labels = bins_and_labels(ax, binner, self.closed, self.label)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function includes the proper handling of ambiguous time by converting the ambiguous time to the timezone of the input `ax` and ensuring the last interval is properly included.

By implementing this correction, the function should be able to handle the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day in Cuba and produce the expected output, resolving the issue described in the GitHub topic.
