The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to an error caused by the presence of ambiguous time in the input data. This is indicated by the error message: "Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times".

The issue seems to be related to the handling of daylight saving time transitions when generating the time bins in the `date_range` function. The time bins are being generated without taking into account that a transition occurs on November 4th, 2018, causing an ambiguous time error.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic for generating the time bins to handle the ambiguous time during daylight saving time transitions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    bins = [first]
    current = first
    while current < last:
        next_bin = current + self.freq
        if next_bin >= ax[-1]:
            next_bin = ax[-1]  # Set the last bin to match the last element in ax

        bins.append(next_bin)
        current = next_bin

    binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(bins, name=ax.name)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

These changes will involve explicitly defining the bin edges, taking into account the potential ambiguity in the time values during the daylight saving time transition. By iterating through the time range and making sure the next time bin does not exceed the last value in `ax`, we can address the issue related to handling ambiguous time.

After implementing these changes, re-run the failing test to ensure that the corrected function passes the test.
