The bug in the _get_time_bins function is likely due to the incorrect calculation of the bin edges and labels for the given DatetimeIndex. The bug seems to be located in the date_range function call and the subsequent _adjust_bin_edges function call.

The issue is likely related to the timezone conversion and the frequency of the generated timestamps not aligning with the original DatetimeIndex.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve ensuring proper timezone conversion and frequency alignment when generating the bin edges and labels.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_time_bins function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().floor(self.freq) + self.freq
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
    bin_edges = binner.values
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == 'right':
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This correction first ensures that the first and last timestamps are rounded down to the nearest boundary given by the frequency. Then, it uses the corrected range to construct the binner and calculate the bin edges, which should properly align with the input DatetimeIndex. Finally, it adjusts the labels and ensures their length matches that of the bins before returning.
