The cause of the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely related to the usage of timestamps with different time zones, leading to incorrect binning and labels. Additionally, the method to generate bins could be potentially incorrect, leading to the mismatch in bin edges and labels.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the time zone information is handled correctly and consistently throughout the function. Moreover, the approach to generate bins and labels needs to be reviewed and potentially adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
import pytz
import numpy as np

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    start_timestamp = ax.tz_localize(None).min()
    end_timestamp = ax.tz_localize(None).max()

    start = start_timestamp.replace(tzinfo=pytz.UTC)
    end = end_timestamp.replace(tzinfo=pytz.UTC)

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=start,
        end=end,
        tz=pytz.UTC,
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax.to_numpy()

    bin_edges = np.concatenate((binner.values, [binner.values[-1] + binner.freq]))

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the time zone information is handled consistently, and the binning method has been adjusted to use `tz_localize` and `to_numpy` methods for handling timestamps and generating bin edges. This should help resolve the bug related to time zone handling and binning mismatch. After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test.
