The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used within the `TimeGrouper` class for time-interval grouping. The function is responsible for generating time bins and labels for the input data. The issue reported on GitHub relates to the failure of the `groupby` method when dealing with daily frequency and ambiguous time stamps due to clock changes, such as the case in Cuba.

The potential error locations within the `_get_time_bins` function are related to the generation of time bins, edge handling for timestamps, and labeling.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_time_bins` function does not handle ambiguous time stamps, which leads to the `groupby` method raising an `AmbiguousTimeError` when dealing with daily frequency and ambiguous timestamps.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to enhance the logic within the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous time stamps and properly generate time bins and labels for daily frequency and cases of clock changes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust for ambiguous time stamps
    start = ax[0]
    end = ax[-1]
    adjusted_start = start - Timedelta("1s")
    adjusted_end = end + Timedelta("1s")

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=adjusted_start,
        end=adjusted_end,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins handling nanoseconds and ambiguous time stamps
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Handle labels and bins with different lengths
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes adjustments for handling ambiguous time stamps, as well as generation of bins and labels that account for the potential issue that leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

By using this corrected version of the function within the `TimeGrouper` class, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved and the failing test should pass.
