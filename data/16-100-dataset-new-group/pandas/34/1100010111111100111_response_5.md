Looking at the `get_time_bins` function and its associated test, it appears that the error occurs when grouping by a daily frequency on a day with a time change in the local timezone, leading to an ambiguous timestamp. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError due to how the pandas library handles the time grouping. 

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the failure of the `date_range` function to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an error when attempting to group by the specified frequency.

One strategy to fix this issue is to ensure that the `date_range` function properly accounts for the ambiguous timestamps when creating the labels for grouping. This may involve handling the ambiguous time explicitly and assigning the correct label to each group.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last + pd.DateOffset(days=1),  # Add a day to the last timestamp to handle ambiguous time
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The correction involves adding a day to the last timestamp when creating the date range `binner` to ensure that the ambiguous time is handled correctly. This should resolve the issue with grouping by daily frequency on days with time changes.
