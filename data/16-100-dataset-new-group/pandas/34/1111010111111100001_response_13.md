The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of time bins and labels when dealing with timezone conversions or Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is used for time-interval grouping in a DataFrame. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` triggers an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data at midnight across DST transitions.

It seems that the function is not handling DST transitions correctly when generating the time bins and labels for the resampling process, which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised during the test. This error occurs when the function attempts to infer the DST time from a specific datetime, but there are no repeated times in the index, making it ambiguous.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the time bins and labels are properly adjusted to account for potential DST transitions and ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    # Adjust the timezone to UTC to avoid AmbiguousTimeError during resampling
    ax_utc = ax.tz_convert("UTC")

    first = ax_utc.min().tz_convert(ax.tz)  # Convert back to original timezone
    last = ax_utc.max().tz_convert(ax.tz)   # Convert back to original timezone

    # Re-generate the time range using the original timezone
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins accounting for potential DST transitions
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Ensure the number of labels matches the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we adjust the timezone to UTC before determining the first and last timestamps for the time range. This prevents the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring during the resampling process. Additionally, we handle potential DST transitions when generating the time bins and labels.
