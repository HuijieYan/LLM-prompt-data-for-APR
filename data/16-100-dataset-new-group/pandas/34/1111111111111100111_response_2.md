The root cause of the bug is that the `_get_time_bins` function is not handling ambiguous datetimes correctly when working with Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The issue is caused by the failure of the `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')` call when there's a longer clock change day in Cuba, such as on November 4, 2018, resulting in ambiguous timestamps at midnight.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the ambiguous time error and ensure that the `pd.Grouper` functionality correctly groups the data based on the provided frequency without raising errors for ambiguous timestamps. 

Given the details provided and the issue's relevance, it seems that the following correction should be made to the `_get_time_bins` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    try:
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
    except pytz.AmbiguousTimeError:
        # Handle ambiguous time error, for example, by selecting the earlier timestamp
        offset = self.freq if self.closed == 'left' else -self.freq
        first = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_convert(ax.tz).normalize(ax[0] + offset)
        last = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_convert(ax.tz).normalize(ax[-1] + offset)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated implementation handles the `AmbiguousTimeError` and appropriately selects the earlier timestamp to avoid the error when getting the time bins. Additionally, the function handles adding the offset for the closed interval based on the timestamp frequency.

With these changes, the `pd.Grouper` functionality should correctly group the data based on the provided frequency without raising errors for ambiguous timestamps. This corrected version should address the bug and enable the failing test to pass successfully.
