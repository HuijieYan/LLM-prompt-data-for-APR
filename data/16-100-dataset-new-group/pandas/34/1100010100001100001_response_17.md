The bug in the given function is related to the generation of time bins and labels, which may not be aligned correctly. This can result in the "Values fall after last bin" error due to incorrect alignment of bins and labels.

The potential error locations are identified in the generation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, and the subsequent adjustment of bin edges and bins.

The cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function is used to generate `binner` and `labels` with potential misalignment. This leads to issues with bin edges and bins not being correctly aligned with the labels.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that the `binner` and `labels` generated by `date_range` are aligned with the bin edges and bins. This can be achieved by adjusting the way `date_range` is used and then adjusting the bin edges and bins accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    else:
        labels = binner if self.label == "left" else binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `date_range` function is used to create `binner`, which is then adjusted based on the bin edges, and the bins are calculated accordingly. The `labels` are also adjusted based on the `closed` attribute and label type. Finally, it ensures that if there are more labels than bins, the labels are appropriately adjusted.
