The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing the `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to fail with an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The error occurs when using `pd.Grouper` to group time series data by day, and it arises due to the ambiguous timestamps created by the Daylight Saving Time (DST) changes. 

The issue on GitHub highlights a specific scenario where there is an ambiguous timestamp on a long clock-change day in Cuba, causing the failure in the `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`. The expected output of the test case is to return three groups (one for each day, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November) but the group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and should contain the data points for that day.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be adjusted to handle ambiguous timestamps due to DST changes properly.

Based on the information and the issue description, the bug can be fixed by updating the `date_range` call inside the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps resulting from DST changes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times due to DST changes
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adding the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter to the `date_range` call, the function will be able to handle ambiguous times due to DST changes properly. This fix should resolve the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
