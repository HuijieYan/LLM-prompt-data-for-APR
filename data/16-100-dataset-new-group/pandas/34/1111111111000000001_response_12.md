The potential error location within the buggy function is the calculation of the `first` and `last` timestamps. This calculation can be impacted by the presence of nanosecond parts, potentially leading to errors in the binning process.

The cause of the bug is that when calling the `date_range` function to create the bin edges, the `start` and `end` values are being calculated using the `replace` function, which can swallow the nanosecond part. This can lead to the last bin being slightly before the actual end time, resulting in the error "Values falls after last bin".

To fix the bug, we should directly use the `first` and `last` timestamps without calling the `replace` function on them. This will ensure that the nanosecond part is preserved and the binning process is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()  # Directly use min and max without replace
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this correction, the function should now accurately calculate the time bins without the risk of nanosecond-related errors. This should address the failing test and resolve the bug.
