## The potential error locations within the buggy function:
The issue described on GitHub indicates that the problem occurs when handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically related to a clock change day in Cuba. The problem likely arises when creating bins and labels for grouping daily data points, which coincides with the behavior of the `_get_time_bins` function.

## The cause of the bug:
The `_get_time_bins` function is likely not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly when creating bins and labels for grouping daily data points. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when dealing with data points on a clock change day in Cuba.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Address the handling of ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that bins and labels are created taking into account the ambiguous time on clock change days.
2. The `date_range` function used to create bins and labels should be adapted to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        # GH #12037
        # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
        # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
        # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
        # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last + 1,  # Adjust for the ambiguous time on clock change days
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of `_get_time_bins` function addresses the handling of ambiguous timestamps by adjusting the end time when creating bins and labels using `date_range`. This will ensure that the function can handle ambiguous times, resolving the issue described on GitHub.
