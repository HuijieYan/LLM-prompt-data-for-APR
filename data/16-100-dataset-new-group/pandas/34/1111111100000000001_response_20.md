The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is intended to return the bins, bin edges, and labels based on the given axis. The potential error locations within the function could be related to the calculation of `first` and `last` using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function, as well as the adjustment of bin edges using the `_adjust_bin_edges` function.

The bug seems to be that the calculation of `first` and `last` for bin edges is not handling nanoseconds correctly, and this may be leading to errors in the subsequent calculations of bins and labels. Additionally, there may be issues with the adjustment of bin edges and labels.

To fix the bug, the calculation of `first` and `last` should handle nanoseconds properly, and the adjustment of bin edges and labels should be reviewed to ensure correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().floor(self.freq) + self.freq
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, `first` and `last` are calculated using the `floor` method with the given frequency to handle nanoseconds correctly. The adjustment of bin edges and labels remains the same.
