The bug seems to stem from the handling of timestamps in the `_get_time_bins` function. The error message indicates an issue with the ambiguous time when converting timezones. This likely arises from the timestamp processing being carried out in an inconsistent manner, leading to ambiguous or incorrect datetime calculations.

An immediate strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the timestamp data is processed consistently and accurately, taking into account the timezone conversions and potential ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().normalize()
    last = ax.max().normalize() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps has been adjusted to correctly capture the start and end of the time range. Additionally, the handling of ambiguous times is improved by ensuring that timestamps are consistently processed throughout the function.
