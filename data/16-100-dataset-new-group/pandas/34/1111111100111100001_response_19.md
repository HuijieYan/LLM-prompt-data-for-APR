The error issue is due to a mismatch of the frequency to which a particular timezone transitions to and from daylight saving time (DST) compared to the provided frequency by the original function.

The bug occurs because the `date_range` function used to construct the `binner` and `labels` variables in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class is not accounting for the change in time associated with the transition from standard time to daylight saving time.

To fix it, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function considers the timezone's DST transitions and provides a correct date range.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    start = ax.min().tz_localize(None)
    end = ax.max().tz_localize(None)

    freq = to_offset(self.freq)
    if isinstance(freq, Tick):
        raise ValueError("Cannot generate date time bins for sub-second frequency")

    binner = date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, tz=ax.tz, closed=self.closed)
    labels = binner.copy()

    return binner, [], labels
```

This corrected version calculates the `start` and `end` of the `date_range` function without adjusting for DST transitions, ensuring that the date range is correctly aligned with the provided frequency and timezone. The update to the `_get_time_bins` method should resolve the error related to ambiguous time during DST transition mentioned in the failing test.
