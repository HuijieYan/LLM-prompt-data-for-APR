Based on the given information and the failing test, it appears that the bug is related to datetime index localization. It seems that the bug occurs when applying the time grouper to a timezone-aware datetime index with daylight saving time transitions. 

The error message indicates an issue with ambiguous time detection, which is consistent with the behavior of using `tz_localize` followed by `tz_convert`. This suggests that the bug may be related to the handling of the timezone during the creation of the bins and labels.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the timezone information is correctly handled when creating the bins and labels. This can be achieved by taking into account the timezone offset changes due to daylight saving time transitions. Additionally, the index should be localized and converted to the desired timezone before creating the bins and labels to avoid ambiguous time errors.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_time_bins function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    ax = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_convert('UTC')  # Convert to UTC to avoid ambiguous time errors
    ax = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_convert(self.tz)  # Convert to the desired timezone

    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the input `ax` is first converted to UTC to avoid ambiguous time errors. Then it is converted to the desired timezone specified by the grouper. This approach ensures that the timezone handling is consistent and that the bins and labels are created based on the correct timezone information.

Applying these changes should prevent the bug from causing issues related to ambiguous time errors and enable the function to pass the failing test.
