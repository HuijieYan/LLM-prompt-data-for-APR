First, let's analyze the buggy function `_get_time_bins` and its relationship with the `TimeGrouper` class. The function is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The function takes an `ax` parameter, which is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`.

Potential error locations within the function:
1. Checking the type of `ax` and raising a `TypeError` if it's not a `DatetimeIndex`.
2. The calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps using `_get_timestamp_range_edges`.
3. Adjustment of bin edges and generation of bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`.
4. Manipulation and adjustment of labels.

The cause of the bug:
The bug could be caused by incorrect handling of the timestamps, bin edges, and labels. The function may not be accurately creating the time bins and labels, leading to incorrect grouping of time intervals.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Verify that the input `ax` is indeed a `DatetimeIndex` before proceeding with any calculations.
2. Ensure the correct calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps.
3. Review the adjustment of bin edges and generation of bins to ensure they are accurate.
4. Verify that the manipulation and adjustment of labels are done correctly.

Now, here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version:
1. There is a proper check for `ax` to be a `DatetimeIndex`.
2. `first` and `last` timestamps are directly obtained from `ax.min()` and `ax.max()`.
3. Bin edges and bins are adjusted and generated appropriately.
4. Labels are manipulated based on the `self.closed` and `self.label` conditions.
