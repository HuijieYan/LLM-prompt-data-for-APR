The bug appears to be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `pd.Grouper` function, which is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the pandas library. The bug results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using the `groupby` method with a daily frequency on clock change days in certain time zones such as Cuba.

The bug occurs because the `pd.Grouper` function does not properly handle ambiguous timestamps caused by clock changes. Specifically, the handling of midnight local time on the clock change day is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, the handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days, should be improved to ensure that the `groupby` method with daily frequency returns the correct groups without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bin_edges = self._get_bin_edges(ax)

    binner = bin_edges[1:]
    labels = bin_edges[:-1]

    return binner, bin_edges, labels
```

The `bin_edges` are obtained by invoking a `_get_bin_edges` function to handle the ambiguous timestamps caused by clock changes. The corrected version of `_get_bin_edges` should properly account for the ambiguous timestamps and ensure that the `groupby` method does not raise an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days.
