The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is currently failing to handle the timestamp ambiguity during the clock change day in Cuba, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping by daily frequency in that timezone. The bug is triggered by a combination of the `freq` being set to `'1D'`, the timezone being set to `'America/Havana'`, and the timestamp ambiguity at midnight during the clock change on November 4th, 2018.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect determination of the `binner` and `labels` which do not account for the timestamp ambiguity and shift in timezone offset. This leads to incorrect bin edges and labels, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data. 

To fix the bug, we need to first handle the timestamp ambiguity during the clock change day in Cuba by explicitly setting the `ambiguous` argument in the `date_range` function to `'NaT'`. Additionally, we need to consider the shift in the timezone offset when generating the bin edges and labels.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous='NaT')
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor('D')
    last = ax[-1].ceil('D')
    
    # Generate bins accounting for the timestamp ambiguity and timezone shift
    binner = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="NaT", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version explicitly sets the `ambiguous` parameter to `'NaT' when generating the `binner` index to handle the timestamp ambiguity, and it accounts for the timezone shift by using the timezone of the input index `ax` when generating the bin edges and labels. With these adjustments, the function should now handle the timestamp ambiguity and timezone shift properly, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue when grouping the data.
