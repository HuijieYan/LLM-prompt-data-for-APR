The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function may be causing the groupby with daily frequency to fail with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba. The bug seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps, such as when there is a long clock-change day.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function is handling datetimes in the presence of ambiguous timestamps, particularly in line with the issue description where it mentions that midnight local time on a clock-change day is causing the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, we should address the handling of ambiguous timestamps and ensure that the grouping operation works correctly in the presence of ambiguous times.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min() - self.freq
    last = ax.max()

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        label=self.label,
        convention=self.convention,
    )

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = binner
    else:
        labels = binner

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we're adjusting the `first` and `last` timestamps to work around the issue of midnight local time on a clock-change day being ambiguous. Additionally, we're setting the `closed`, `label`, and `convention` parameters in `date_range` to provide more control over the labeling and grouping of timestamps.

This corrected version aims to provide a more robust handling of ambiguous timestamps and improve the overall grouping behavior, particularly in scenarios with clock change days.
