## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The function first checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`, then proceeds to calculate some date ranges and adjust bin edges based on the input `ax`. The failing test indicates that there is an issue with handling ambiguous time on a clock-change day in Cuba, causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised.

## Identifying Potential Errors
1. The function calculates the start and end of the date range and then uses `date_range` to create bins and labels. This might be where the issue is occurring, as it's not handling ambiguous time correctly.
2. The subsequent adjustment of bin edges may not be correctly handling ambiguous time.

## Cause of the Bug
The issue is caused by the function's inability to correctly handle ambiguous time during a clock-change day in Cuba. This results in the `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised, indicating that the function is not correctly inferring the DST time on November 4, 2018.

## Suggested Fix
To resolve this bug, the function needs to handle ambiguous time correctly, especially during clock-change days. This might involve using an approach that is aware of the timezone's rules for handling ambiguous time. Additionally, the adjustment of bin edges should account for this ambiguity when creating the bins and labels.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use `Timestamp` to handle ambiguous time
    first = Timestamp(ax.min(), tz=ax.tz)
    last = Timestamp(ax.max(), tz=ax.tz)

    # Create bins and labels while handling ambiguous time correctly
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins correctly handling ambiguous time
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if necessary
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we use `Timestamp` to handle ambiguous time, ensuring that the dates are interpreted correctly based on the timezone rules. This should address the issue of the `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised during the grouping process.
