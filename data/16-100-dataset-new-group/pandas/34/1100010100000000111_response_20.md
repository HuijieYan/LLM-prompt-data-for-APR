## Identifying the bug
Based on the information from the GitHub issue and the provided function `_get_time_bins`, the bug seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous time stamps and the grouping of data when there is a daily frequency with specific time zone conversions. The bug is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` to occur in certain scenarios, and the grouping of data is not as expected, especially on days with ambiguous timestamps due to clock changes.

## Potential error locations
- The bug could be related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous time stamps when constructing the time bins with `date_range`.
- The grouping might not be adjusting for the ambiguous time stamps correctly, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the inability of the code to correctly handle ambiguous time stamps during specific time zone conversions and daily frequency. This results in incorrect grouping of data, which ultimately leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` in certain scenarios.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the time bins are properly constructed to handle ambiguous time stamps, taking into account any time zone conversions and frequency requirements.
2. Adjust the grouping mechanism to handle ambiguous time stamps correctly and avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
3. Consider handling the ambiguous time stamps based on the specific time zone rules, especially when dealing with daily frequency.

## Corrected Version
Based on the identified bug and the strategies for fixing it, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use proper handling of ambiguous times and time zone conversions
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Retain the timezone information
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Handle nonexistent times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust the labels if there are more labels than bins
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected function, the handling of ambiguous times and time zone conversions has been updated to better align with the expected behavior, especially when dealing with the daily frequency and specific time zone conversions. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
