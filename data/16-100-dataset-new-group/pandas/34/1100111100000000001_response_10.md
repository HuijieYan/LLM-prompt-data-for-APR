The buggy function appears to be the `_get_time_bins` method within the `TimeGrouper` class, which is part of the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. 

Based on the code, the potential error locations within the function include:
1. The comparison and handling of `ax` not being an instance of `DatetimeIndex`.
2. The handling of edge cases with an empty `ax` list.
3. The adjustment of bin edges and labels.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of the `ax` input that is not an instance of `DatetimeIndex`, which leads to a `TypeError` being raised.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the input `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex` before proceeding with any operations.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    binner = labels = None

    if len(ax) > 0:
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        # GH #12037
        # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
        # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
        # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
        # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the input `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`. If it is, the necessary calculations and adjustments are made. Additionally, the initializations for `binner` and `labels` have been included to account for the case when `ax` is empty.
