The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function causes an issue when handling ambiguous timestamps on a clock change day in Cuba. The function fails to properly handle the situation, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This issue has been documented on GitHub, and the failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` attempts to capture the problem.

The bug is affecting the labeling of the group for the 4th of November, which should contain the hourly data points for that day, correctly labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00'. The function currently fails to handle this scenario, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError` and incorrect labeling.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should be updated to handle ambiguous time points correctly, especially in scenarios of clock changes such as the one observed in Cuba. The logic for generating bins, labels, and handling ambiguous timestamps should be revised to ensure that the function can process these situations without causing errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize()

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last + pd.Timedelta(days=1),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we've made changes to handle ambiguous timestamps by normalizing the `first` and `last` values before computing the bins and labels. This approach allows the function to properly handle the situation of clock change and ambiguous times, addressing the `AmbiguousTimeError` that was observed in the failing test.
