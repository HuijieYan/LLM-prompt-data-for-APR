The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to handling the daylight saving time transition on the clock change day in Cuba. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError when using the `groupby` method with a daily frequency. The issue on GitHub provides a code sample that triggers the problem and describes the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to generating the time bins and labels from the `DatetimeIndex` in a way that does not properly account for ambiguous times due to the clock change. This error occurs when the time zone changes from `-04:00` to `-05:00` at midnight on November 4, 2018.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to adjust the code to handle the transition in the time zone due to the clock change on November 4, 2018, ensuring that the time bins and labels are accurately created without raising AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to properly handle the time zone transition on November 4, 2018, and the handling of ambiguous times on clock change days. After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
