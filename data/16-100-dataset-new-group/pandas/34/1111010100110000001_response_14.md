The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is attempting to create time bins based on the given axis, but it seems to be encountering an issue with the time zones, leading to the raised `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError`.

Looking at the error message, it seems to be failing at `return self.groupby._get_time_bins(self.ax)` inside the `_get_binner_for_time` method.

The bug may be related to dealing with ambiguous times during the transition to or from daylight saving time, particularly around the `date_range` call.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to explicitly handle ambiguous times during the creation of date ranges, ensuring that any ambiguous times are handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Localize the DatetimeIndex to UTC to avoid ambiguity during bin creation
    ax = ax.tz_localize(None)

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use the UTC-localized values for creating date ranges
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=None,  # Specify that date range should not be timezone aware
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we first remove the timezone information from the `DatetimeIndex` to avoid ambiguity. Then, when creating the date ranges, we explicitly set the timezone to `None` to make sure the creation of date ranges doesn't encounter ambiguous times.
