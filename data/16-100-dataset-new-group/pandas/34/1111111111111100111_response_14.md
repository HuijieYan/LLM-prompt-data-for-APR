The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas.core.resample` module is causing the tested functionality to fail. This function is called when performing groupby operations on a DataFrame with a datetime index. The issue reported on GitHub describes the failure, indicating that the call to `groupby` raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` when working with a long clock-change day in Cuba.

After analyzing the function and the failing test case, it appears that the bug is related to handling timestamps on clock change days, particularly when the timestamp is ambiguous.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle ambiguous time changes on the clock change day, leading to the creation of bin edges and labels that result in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to address the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for calculating bin edges, labels, and handling ambiguous times in a way that resolves the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    # Adjust start and end points to avoid AmbiguousTimeError
    start = first.tz_localize(None)
    end = last.tz_localize(None)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=start,
        end=end,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by returning NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This revised function includes adjustments to the handling of ambiguous times by utilizing the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function. Additionally, it corrects the identification of start and end points to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`. With these changes, the tested functionality should be able to handle datetime index data on clock change days without raising the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
