Based on the buggy function and the failing test function, as well as the provided GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in certain time zones.

The bug seems to be causing an AmbiguousTimeError when using pd.Grouper with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. This occurs because pd.Grouper does not handle ambiguous timestamps as expected, resulting in incorrect grouping of the data.

In order to fix the bug, a strategy could be to modify the _get_time_bins function to handle ambiguous timestamps properly, ensuring that it correctly identifies and handles the timestamps that could be ambiguous due to the time zone changes.

Here's a corrected version of the _get_time_bins function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Modify the start and end to handle ambiguous timestamps
    # Check if the first and last timestamps are ambiguous and adjust accordingly
    if first.tz_localize(None).is_dst and last.tz_localize(None).is_dst:
        first = first.tz_localize(None) - Timedelta(hours=1)
        last = last.tz_localize(None) + Timedelta(hours=1)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to detect if the first and last timestamps are ambiguous, and we adjusted them accordingly by accounting for the possibility of Daylight Saving Time (DST) changes.

This modification should address the issue described in the failing test function and resolve the GitHub issue related to the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days in Cuba.
