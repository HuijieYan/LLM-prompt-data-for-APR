From the provided information, it appears that the bug is occurring when using `pd.Grouper` with a frequency of '1D' on a date range with timestamps that are ambiguous due to the timezone change in Cuba. It is resulting in an `AmbigiousTimeError`, and the cause of the bug seems to be related to the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas` library.

The source of the bug can be attributed to the way the `binner` and `labels` are created within the `_get_time_bins` function. The code does not handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the error when attempting to group by day.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps, especially when generating the `binner` and `labels`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Convert the index to non-ambiguous timestamps
    non_ambiguous_index = ax.tz_localize(None)
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        non_ambiguous_index.min(), non_ambiguous_index.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use non-ambiguous first/last timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we convert the original index to non-ambiguous timestamps before calculating the first and last timestamps. By doing so, the ambiguous timestamps issue arising from the timezone change in Cuba is resolved.

This corrected version should address the bug and fix the AmbiguousTimeError when using `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency on a date range with ambiguous timestamps.
