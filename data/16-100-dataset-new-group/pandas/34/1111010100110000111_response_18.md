The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is causing the error. The function is using the `date_range` method to create bins and labels for time groupings, but it fails to handle ambiguous time due to clock changes (e.g., DST transition).

The GitHub issue describes a specific case where this bug is reproducible - on a clock change day in Cuba, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError. This error occurs because on a clock change day where the hour is repeated (e.g., due to DST), the function does not handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly, leading to the error.

A strategy for fixing this bug could be to modify the logic within the `_get_time_bins` function to detect ambiguous times and properly handle them to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError. This might involve checking for ambiguous times and adjusting the bin and label creation process accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the start and end of the datetime index considering the frequency
    start, end = ax[0].floor(self.freq), ax[-1].ceil(self.freq)

    # Create the binner and labels with the fixed frequency, ambiguous time handling, and non-existent time handling
    binner, bins, labels = date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version properly handles the datetime index ax, adjusts the start and end times accounting for frequency, and uses `date_range` with the correct arguments to handle ambiguous and non-existent times. This should resolve the issue reported on the GitHub page and pass the failing test case.
