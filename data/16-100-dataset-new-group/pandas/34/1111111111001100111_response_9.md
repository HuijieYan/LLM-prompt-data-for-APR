The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing the `groupby` operation to fail with an `AmbiguousTimeError` on a clock change day in Cuba. The issue arises because the function doesn't properly handle ambiguous time stamps, leading to incorrect grouping of data. This bug is confirmed by analyzing the failing test and the runtime values and types of variables inside the function.

The bug results in incorrect labeling of the group for the 4th of November, and it does not contain the expected 25 hourly data points as it should. The incorrect time bin computation is due to the problematic handling of ambiguous timestamps and incorrect labeling of the group.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the function properly handles the ambiguous timestamps caused by clock changes on certain days, especially in time zones like Cuba. This involves correcting the computation of the first and last time bin edges, adjusting the labels, and handling any potential issues related to ambiguous time stamps.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    tz_ambiguous = ax.is_ambiguous()
    if tz_ambiguous.any():
        # Ensure using 'infer' for ambiguous and non-existent times
        dst_rule = 'infer' if tz_ambiguous.any() else 'shift_forward'

        # Adjust time bins and bin edges considering ambiguous times
        binner, labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=ax[0],
            end=ax[-1] + pd.Timedelta(hours=1),  # Add an extra hour to ensure the last bin
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous='infer',
            nonexistent=dst_rule
        )

        last = binner[-1]  # Set the last bin as the last value in binner
    else:
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The revised function initializes a boolean variable `tz_ambiguous` to capture ambiguous time stamps. If ambiguous times are found, we adjust the time bins and bin edges accordingly, observing the 'infer' rule for ambiguous and non-existent times. Lastly, we accurately set the last bin until the last value in `binner`.

This corrected version is expected to resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the test pass for the `groupby` with daily frequency operations.
