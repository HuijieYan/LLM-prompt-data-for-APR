The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in the pandas library. The function is responsible for generating time bins for grouping a DatetimeIndex based on the specified frequency, closed end of the interval, and label.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the generation of the `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `labels` variables, as well as the adjustment of the labels to match the number of bins.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect adjustment of the labels when the frequency and labels of the time bins do not match the length of the bins, as identified by the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`. This test aims to group data by a frequency of 1 day and compare the result with the expected output. However, the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function causes the length of the time bins to be incorrect, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to review the logic for generating time bins and labels, ensuring that they match the specified frequency and label, and adjusting them accordingly if there is a mismatch between the number of bins and labels.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right":
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected version addresses the potential issues in generating the time bins and labels, ensuring that they match the specified frequency and label, and adjusting them accordingly to avoid a mismatch. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
