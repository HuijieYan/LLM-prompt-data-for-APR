## Correction

The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically for the daylight saving time shift in the `America/Havana` timezone. To fix this bug, it's important to account for the ambiguous timestamps and ensure that the bins and labels are correctly assigned.

The fix involves updating the logic to handle ambiguous timestamps by explicitly checking for the existence of ambiguous times and using appropriate methods to handle them. This can be achieved by considering the timezone characteristics and using the `DST` flag to handle daylight saving time shifts.

Additionally, the labels and bins need to be adjusted correctly based on the ambiguous timestamps which would resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to handling daily frequency on clock change days in Cuba.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
  if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
      raise TypeError(
          "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
          f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
      )

  if len(ax) == 0:
      binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
      return binner, [], labels

  first = ax[0].floor('D')
  last = ax[-1].ceil('D')

  binner = date_range(
      start=first,
      end=last,
      freq=self.freq,
      tz=ax.tz,
      name=ax.name,
      ambiguous="infer",
      nonexistent="shift_forward",
  )

  ax_values = ax.asi8
  binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
  bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

  if self.closed == "right":
      labels = binner
      if self.label == "right":
          labels = labels[1:]
  elif self.label == "right":
      labels = labels[1:]

  if ax.hasnans:
      binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
      labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

  if len(bins) < len(labels):
      labels = labels[: len(bins)]
  return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function accounts for ambiguous times and adjusts the labels and bins accordingly to handle the daylight saving time shift in the `America/Havana` timezone. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected in cases with ambiguous timestamps.
