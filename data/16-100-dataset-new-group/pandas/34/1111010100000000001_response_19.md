The buggy function `_get_time_bins(self, ax)` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. This function is responsible for getting time bins and labels based on the input `ax` which should be a `DatetimeIndex`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The usage of the `_adjust_bin_edges` method which is not defined within the given code.
2. The manipulation of the `binner` and `labels` variables without proper handling of their length and ordering.
3. The insertion of `NaT` values without properly accounting for the potential error.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the calculation and adjustment of time bins and labels correctly, leading to potential errors related to the size and ordering of the bins and labels.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to:
1. Ensure that the `_adjust_bin_edges` method is defined and correctly handling the adjustment of bin edges.
2. Properly handle the manipulation of `binner` and `labels` to maintain their size, order, and content consistency.
3. Carefully handle the insertion of `NaT` values to avoid potential indexing errors and ensure proper accounting for their presence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:


```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    # Assuming _adjust_bin_edges is a method adjusting bin edges
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins using bin values and edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if more than bins or NaN values are present
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In this corrected version, the manipulation and handling of `binner` and `labels` are adjusted to ensure proper size and content consistency. Additionally, the assumption is made that the `_adjust_bin_edges` method is correctly defined to handle the adjustment of bin edges.
