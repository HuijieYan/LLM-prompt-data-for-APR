The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the usage of the `date_range` function to generate bin labels for grouping. The issue is caused by the `date_range` function's behavior when handling ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock change days, which leads to incorrect bin labels and subsequently incorrect groupings.

To fix the bug, a potential strategy is to use the `ax` DatetimeIndex to generate bin labels manually, ensuring that ambiguous timestamps are handled correctly, taking into account the behavior of timestamps on clock change days.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
    last = ax[-1] + self.freq
    bins = []

    current_bin_start = first
    for i in range(len(ax)):
        if ax[i] < current_bin_start:
            continue
        if ax[i] < current_bin_start + self.freq:
            bins.append(i)
        else:
            current_bin_start += self.freq
            bins.append(i)
    
    binner = ax[bins]
    labels = binner.copy()
    labels = labels.shift(-1)

    if self.closed == "left":
        labels = labels[:-1]
    elif self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner.copy()
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the bin labels are generated manually based on the behavior of the `ax` DatetimeIndex, ensuring correct handling of ambiguous timestamps. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post related to clock change days in Cuba.
