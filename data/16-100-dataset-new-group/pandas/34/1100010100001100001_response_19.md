The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is designed to generate time bins for given input data. In this case, the function should take a DatetimeIndex and other parameters as input and return calculated time bins.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the improper calculation of the `binner` and `labels` variables. This is evident from the fact that both `binner` and `labels` are not consistent with the input `ax` and other related variables.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect calculation of `first`, `last`, `binner`, and `labels`. There is a discrepancy between the calculated `first` and `last` time bins and the actual data in the `ax` parameter. This is causing the incorrect generation of `binner`, `labels`, and `bins`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of `first`, `last`, `binner`, and `labels` is consistent with the input `ax` and other related variables.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max() + self.freq  # increment by the frequency to include the last timestamp
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the calculation of `first` and `last` has been fixed to use the min and max of the input `ax` without `_get_timestamp_range_edges`. Additionally, `last` is incremented by the frequency to ensure it includes the last timestamp. This will ensure that the `binner` and `labels` are consistent with the input `ax` and other related variables.
