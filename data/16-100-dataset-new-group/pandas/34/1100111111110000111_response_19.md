The bug in the `_get_time_bins()` function is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when the `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` test is executed. The bug prevents the grouping to handle ambiguous timestamps properly, leading to the error.

The cause of the bug is in the `_get_time_bins()` function. The function fails to properly handle the ambiguous timestamps due to the impact of daylight saving time when creating date intervals for grouping. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError`, as indicated in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins()` function should be updated to handle ambiguous timestamps that are caused by the Daylight Saving Time (DST) clock change event. The `date_range` function within `_get_time_bins()` needs to be modified to handle such ambiguities when creating the time bins.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins()` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Create the time bins, handling ambiguous times by setting 'ambiguous' parameter to 'NaT'
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Set ambiguous parameter to 'NaT'
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With these changes, the `_get_time_bins()` function now properly handles ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that the `AmbiguousTimeError` does not occur when creating the time bins for grouping.

This correction resolves the issue reported on GitHub related to the `groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba`.
