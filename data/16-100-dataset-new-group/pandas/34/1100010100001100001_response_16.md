The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is intended to return the time bins used for resampling a DatetimeIndex. However, there are several issues with the function that need to be addressed:

1. The function lacks a mechanism to handle time zones correctly, which is evident in the incorrect `binner` and `labels` outputs.
2. There is an incorrect use of time ranges, possibly due to improperly formatted `first` and `last` values causing incorrect label generation.
3. It is possible that the function is not properly handling the bin adjustments.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure proper handling of time zones and correct generation of binner and label indices. It is also important to revisit the bin adjustment logic to ensure accuracy in generating the bins.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust for time zone
    ax = ax.tz_convert(self.freq.tz) if self.freq is not None else ax

    # Get the first and last timestamps
    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().floor(self.freq) + self.freq

    # Generate binner and labels
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, some changes are made:
- The time zone handling and floor function are used to fix the time zone issue while generating `first` and `last`.
- The label and binner generation is corrected based on the label type.
- The adjustment logic is left unchanged, assuming it is correct.

This corrected version should effectively address the issues experienced in the buggy function, providing the expected output for further tests.
