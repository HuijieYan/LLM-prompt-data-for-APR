In the given buggy function `_get_time_bins`, the error seems to be related to the handling of time zones and ambiguous timestamps. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` also points to a specific issue with handling daylight saving time transitions in the `groupby` operation. The error message specifically mentions an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the implementation does not properly handle ambiguous timestamps related to daylight saving time transitions. This issue has been reported on GitHub, and the test confirms this problem when dealing with time zone transitions in the `groupby` operation.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_time_bins` needs to be updated to handle ambiguous timestamps and daylight saving time transitions properly.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

```

This corrected version directly creates `binner` using `date_range` with `ambiguous="infer"`, which should handle any ambiguous timestamps properly. Additionally, it adjusts the labels if there are more labels than bins.

This updated implementation should resolve the issue and fix the bug.
