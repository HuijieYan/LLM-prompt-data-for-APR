The buggy function is _get_time_bins(self, ax), which is a method inside the TimeGrouper class. The function is intended to generate time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex ax, using other helper functions such as _get_timestamp_range_edges and _adjust_bin_edges from the same file but different classes.

The issue arises when the binner and labels are being generated. The function date_range generates these using the start and end timestamps (first and last) obtained from _get_timestamp_range_edges. The values of first and last define the start and end of the time range. However, the bug occurs because these values are directly used to create binner and labels, and any difference in nanoseconds between them can lead to issues.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to modify the generation of binner and labels to handle the nanosecond part accurately during the creation of the time range.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    freq_str = self.freq.freqstr  # Get the frequency string
    start = (first - freq_str) + 1  # Shift the start back by 1 unit to account for nanoseconds
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=start,
        periods=len(ax)+1,  # Use the length of ax to determine the periods
        freq=self.freq, 
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, we modify the start timestamp by shifting it back by 1 unit to account for nanoseconds. Then, we use the length of the input DatetimeIndex to determine the number of periods while creating the range. This fixes the bug where nanosecond parts between first and last could cause issues in generating the binner and labels.
