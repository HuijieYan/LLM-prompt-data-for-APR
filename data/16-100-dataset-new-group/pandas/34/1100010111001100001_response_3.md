The bug seems to be related to the generation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function and the subsequent adjustment of bins and labels. The issue may be arising due to the handling of timezones and daylight savings time in the generation of `binner` and `labels`.

The cause of the bug is that the generation of `binner` and `labels` does not handle the transition from standard time to daylight savings time and vice versa correctly. This results in the incorrect output of bins and labels, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, we can modify the generation of `binner` and `labels` to account for the transitions between standard time and daylight savings time. Additionally, the adjustment of bins and labels based on timezone and daylight savings time should be handled carefully to ensure correct output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor(freq=self.freq)
    last = ax[-1].ceil(freq=self.freq)

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        periods=len(ax) + 1,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `binner` is generated using the `date_range` function with the `start` parameter set to the floor of the first timestamp in the input index, and the `periods` parameter set to the length of the index plus 1. This ensures that the transition from standard time to daylight savings time is handled correctly. Additionally, the adjustment of bins and labels has been kept intact as it seems to be correctly handling the remaining cases.
