## Analysis
The issue is related to the `groupby` function failing with `AmbiguousTimeError` on a clock change day in Cuba. The problem is caused by the `pandas.core.resample._get_time_bins` function, where it fails to handle ambiguous time due to the clock change in Cuba.

Potential Error Locations:
- Inadequate handling of ambiguous time during the clock change.
- Incorrect binning of timestamps causing ambiguous time errors.

Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `groupby` operation to raise an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the inability of the `_get_time_bins` function to handle the ambiguous timestamp during a clock change. This leads to incorrect grouping of hourly data points in the case of a clock change, resulting in the error.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_time_bins` function properly handles the ambiguous time during the clock change, taking into account the timezone information and any missing or overlapping timestamps.

Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Ensure proper handling of the ambiguous time during clock change
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans, ambiguous="infer"
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version addresses the handling of ambiguous time during a clock change in the `date_range` and `lib.generate_bins_dt64` calls, as well as handling the label adjustments appropriately.

This should resolve the issue reported with the `groupby` operation failing with `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days in Cuba.
