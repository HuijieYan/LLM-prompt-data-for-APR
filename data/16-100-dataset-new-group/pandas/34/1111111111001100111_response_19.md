To fix the bug, we need to address the issue of ambiguous time on clock change day in Cuba. The problem arises from the `pd.date_range` function creating a series of timestamps with an ambiguous hour due to the clock change.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could be to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly, ensuring that the grouping by daily frequency works as expected. The update should include handling the ambiguous timestamps to avoid raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max() - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)  # Adjust by one second to avoid ambiguous time
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated version of the function includes changes to handle the ambiguous timestamps on a clock change day, ensuring that the grouping by daily frequency works as expected without raising an AmbiguousTimeError.

Additionally, it's important to update the associated test case to verify that the corrected function resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

The fix should be tested with the provided failing test case to ensure it now returns the expected output without raising the AmbiguousTimeError.
