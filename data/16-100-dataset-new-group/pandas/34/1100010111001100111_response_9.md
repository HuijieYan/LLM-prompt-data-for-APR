## Analysis
The bug likely arises from the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, such as situations where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. The test case also highlights that the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError.

The 'groupby' operation based on the frequency of '1D' is expected to return three groups, one for each day from November 3rd to November 5th, with particular attention to how the date and time of the group for November 4th are labeled. The output should provide the hourly data points for each of these days.

The issue is found to be similar to a previously addressed issue #23742, which was fixed in a previous version of pandas. However, the problem described in the GitHub issue has persisted in the version used (0.24.2).

## Bug Identification
The bug appears to stem from how the function `_get_time_bins` handles ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. This is likely causing the AmbiguousTimeError and resulting in incorrect groupings in the output.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Identify the ambiguous timestamps caused by clock change days and handle them appropriately, ensuring they are correctly labeled in the output groupby operation.
2. Consider using the 'ambiguous' parameter in the `date_range` function to infer and handle ambiguous times to address the issue of AmbiguousTimeError.
3. Ensure that the hourly data points are arranged and labeled correctly for each day in the groupby output.

## Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use the 'ambiguous' parameter to infer and handle ambiguous times
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In this bug-fixed version, the 'ambiguous' parameter is used in the `date_range` function to infer and handle ambiguous times. Additionally, other minor adjustments have been made to ensure proper label handling and alignment with the groupby operation's expected output.
