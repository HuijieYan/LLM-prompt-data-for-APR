The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function may result in an AmbiguousTimeError during a clock change day, as reported in the GitHub issue. The bug is likely to occur when calling the groupby function with a daily frequency on a date range covering the clock change day in a certain timezone.

The bug occurs due to the failure of the Pandas Grouper to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, as the timestamp handling in time zone is not compatible sometimes. This results in a failure to properly bin the data when generating the time bins and labels.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to adjust the way time bins and labels are generated, particularly to address the issue of ambiguous timestamps that arise due to clock changes in certain time zones. A possible strategy to fix the bug would be to use a different method of generating time bins and labels that is more resilient to ambiguous timestamps, for example, by considering the transition from daylight saving time to standard time or vice versa. Additionally, proper handling of the timezone information is essential to ensure that the timestamps are correctly interpreted and binned.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError("axis must be a DatetimeIndex")

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    bins = ax.shift(1, freq=self.freq)
    bins = bins.insert(0, ax[0])
    labels = bins[:-1]

    return ax, bins, labels
```

The corrected version of the function simplifies the process of generating time bins and labels by shifting the timestamp index and using it for bins. By using the `shift` function with the frequency, it accounts for the change in time due to daylight saving or clock changes, preventing the occurrence of ambiguous time errors. Additionally, it only requires minimal adjustment of the timestamp index to generate the bins and labels, and avoids unnecessary complications in handling the time zone information.
