Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to handling ambiguous time in the time bins. The error message specifically mentions an AmbiguousTimeError related to clock change day in Cuba. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, which also describes a similar problem.

The bug is likely occurring in the `_get_time_bins` function, where the time bins are being calculated. It seems that the issue arises when handling ambiguous time on the clock change day, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to handle ambiguous time explicitly and ensure that the time bins are calculated correctly. This may involve using different methods to handle ambiguous time or adjusting the logic for calculating time bins on clock change days.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Get the start and end timestamps
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Determine if the timezone contains ambiguous times
    is_ambiguous = ax.tz._is_in_dst(ax)

    # Handle ambiguous times
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer" if is_ambiguous else None,
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Calculate the bins
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Handle labels based on the closed and label attributes
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Ensure the length of labels matches the length of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the code explicitly checks whether the timezone contains ambiguous times and sets the `ambiguous` parameter in `date_range` accordingly. This change should help handle ambiguous times on clock change days correctly.

With this corrected version, the `_get_time_bins` function should be able to handle ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba, resolving the AmbiguousTimeError and addressing the issue in the GitHub report.
