The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`. This error occurs when trying to group data with a daily frequency with timestamps on a clock change day in Cuba.

The cause of the bug is that the `binner` and `labels` are being generated using `date_range`, which cannot handle the ambiguity of timestamps on a clock change day in a specific timezone such as Cuba. As a result, the `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised when trying to group the data.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to use a more robust method for generating the `binner` and `labels` that can handle the ambiguous timestamps on a clock change day. This may involve using an alternative approach to generate the bins and labels based on the timezone and frequency of the data.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Generate bins and labels based on timezone and frequency
    binner = ax.floor(self.freq)
    labels = binner + self.freq

    # Adjust the bins and labels if necessary
    bin_edges = binner.union_single(labels)
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By using the `ax.floor` method, the bins and labels are generated based on the timezone and frequency of the data, allowing for proper handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and ensure that the test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` passes successfully.
