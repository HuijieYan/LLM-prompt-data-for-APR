The bug occurs due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during the daylight saving time change in Cuba. When the timestamp is ambiguous, the function fails to handle it properly and raises an AmbiguousTimeError. This is evident from the GitHub issue where it is reported that the call to groupby function raises an AmbiguousTimeError on a long clock-change day in Cuba.

The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `_get_time_bins` function. The specific issue is related to the fact that on the day of the clock change, midnight local time becomes ambiguous. The function does not correctly label the group for the day of the clock change and fails to handle the ambiguous timestamp.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps during the daylight saving time change. Specifically, the function should correctly label the group for the day of the clock change and handle the ambiguous timestamp without raising an AmbiguousTimeError.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Use tz_convert to handle the ambiguous timestamp during the daylight saving time change
    first = first.tz_convert(self.freq.tz)
    last = last.tz_convert(self.freq.tz)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=self.freq.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `tz_convert` method is used to handle the ambiguous timestamp during the daylight saving time change. The function will now correctly handle the ambiguous timestamp without raising an AmbiguousTimeError.
