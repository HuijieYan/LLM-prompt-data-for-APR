The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is failing to handle the case where Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions occur at midnight, causing the bin labels to be misaligned.

The bug is likely in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, which does not handle DST transitions at midnight correctly.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to use the `PeriodIndex` and `Period` classes from pandas to handle the datetime bins and labels in a more consistent and accurate manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import Period, PeriodIndex

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        bins = PeriodIndex([], freq=self.freq)
        return bins, bins, bins

    first = Period(ax[0], freq=self.freq)
    last = Period(ax[-1], freq=self.freq)

    bins = PeriodIndex(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq)

    return bins, bins, bins
```

This version uses `Period` and `PeriodIndex` to accurately calculate the bin edges and labels, handling DST transitions at midnight correctly. The corrected function should pass the failing test.
