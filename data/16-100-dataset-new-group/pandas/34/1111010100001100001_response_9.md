The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely related to the handling of time bins, labels, and bin edges. The bug manifests as incorrect binning and labeling of the time intervals, resulting in incorrect output values.

The `binner` and `labels` variables, which are supposed to contain the calculated boundaries of time intervals, are incorrectly generated due to issues with the calculation of `bin_edges` and `ax_values`. As a result, the `bins` variable, representing the generated bins, is also incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of `binner`, `labels`, and `bins` accurately reflects the time intervals based on the input `ax` and the specified frequency (`freq`).

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    binner = binner.union([last])

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on closed and label properties
    labels = binner.shift(1, freq=self.freq)
    labels = labels[1:] if self.label == 'right' else labels

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the boundaries of time intervals (`binner` and `labels`) and the generated bins (`bins`) accurately represent the specified frequency and the input `ax`. We adjust the labels based on the `closed` and `label` properties and address the inclusion of nanoseconds in the time calculations to produce correct interval boundaries and bins.
