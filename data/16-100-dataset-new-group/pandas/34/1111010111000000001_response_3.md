The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class does not appear to have any immediate syntax errors, but the bug may stem from the logic and calculations within the function. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` implies that there may be an issue with handling time zone conversions and daylight saving time changes when downsampling time intervals.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the calculations related to time zone conversions and handling of daylight saving time changes when creating the bins and labels for time intervals.

The cause of the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function may be related to how the function handles time zone conversions and how it calculates the bins and labels for time intervals, potentially leading to incorrect binning and labeling of the data.

One strategy to fix the bug could be to carefully review the logic for time zone conversions, handling of daylight saving time changes, and the calculations for creating time bins and labels. Additionally, ensuring that the timezone-related attributes and features of the input data are handled correctly would be crucial. 

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax[0], ax[-1]
    bins = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, closed=self.closed)
    
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = bins[1:]
    else:
        labels = bins[:-1]

    return bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, I simplified the function to calculate the time bins and labels by using the `date_range` function, which handles timezone conversions and daylight saving time changes automatically. This approach can help in avoiding potential issues related to time zone conversions and incorrect labeling of time intervals.
