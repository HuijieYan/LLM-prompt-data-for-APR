The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely to be related to the calculation of `bins` and `labels`. The function should correctly calculate the bins and labels based on the input parameters, but the current implementation seems to be incorrect as the return values are not consistent with the expected results.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the calculation of the bins and labels, as well as the adjustment of bin edges in the `_adjust_bin_edges` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of bins, labels, and bin edges is done correctly based on the input parameters and the properties of the `ax` variable. We need to review the logic of the calculations and ensure that the adjustments are made properly to account for different time zones and frequencies.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the calculation of `binner`, `bin_edges`, `bins`, and `labels` has been revised to ensure the correct behavior based on the input parameters, including the time zone and frequency adjustments.
