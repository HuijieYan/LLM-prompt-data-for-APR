The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is designed to handle time bins for a DatetimeIndex. However, there are potential issues in this function that need to be addressed.

1. The function checks if the input `ax` is a DatetimeIndex. If not, it raises a TypeError.

2. There is a part of the code that tries to create date ranges using the `date_range` function, followed by adjustments to the bins and labels based on certain conditions.

3. There is a check for handling NaN values in the input data.

Based on the analysis, the potential bug lies in the logic related to creating date ranges using the `date_range` function and the subsequent adjustments to the bins and labels.

To fix this bug, we should reconsider the approach for creating date ranges and handling adjustments while ensuring that the logic for handling NaN values is correct.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, closed=self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, I have removed the direct usage of `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and replaced it with `ax.min()` and `ax.max()` to determine the first and last timestamps. Additionally, I have revised the logic for creating date ranges using the `date_range` function with the specified parameters. Lastly, I have retained the adjustments for bins and labels as per the original code.
