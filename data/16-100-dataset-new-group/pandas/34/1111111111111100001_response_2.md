After analyzing the provided function and the failing test, it is evident that the bug lies in the conversion of the input `DatetimeIndex` to the corresponding `freq`, `start`, and `end` using the `date_range` function. The resulting `date_range` fails to account for the switching time during daylight saving transition, leading to the ambiguous time error.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the daylight saving transition explicitly when creating the `date_range` and ensure that it accounts for the potential ambiguity in time.

Here's the corrected version of the function, taking into consideration the handling of ambiguous time during daylight saving transition:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    freq = self.freq
    closed = self.closed
    base = self.base

    offset = freq.freqstr
    if isinstance(offset, str):
        offset = pd.tseries.frequencies.to_offset(offset)

    # Handling the daylight saving transition explicitly
    offset_skew = pd.tseries.frequencies.to_offset('1s')
    first -= offset_skew
    last -= offset_skew

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=closed,
        base=base,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the potential ambiguity in time during the daylight saving transition by subtracting a small offset before creating the `date_range`. This adjustment ensures that the `date_range` function correctly accounts for the transition, preventing the ambiguous time error encountered in the failing test.
