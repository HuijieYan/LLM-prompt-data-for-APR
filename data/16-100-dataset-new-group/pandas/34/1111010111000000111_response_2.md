The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class has a bug that causes the `groupby()` to raise an `AmbiguousTimeError` when encountering dates with ambiguous timestamps, such as during a clock change day in Cuba. This has been reported in GitHub issue #23742 but seems to have reoccurred after the fix in pandas version 0.24.

The bug is likely caused by the improper handling of ambiguous timestamps within the `_get_time_bins` function. The use of `date_range` and insertion of NaT values seems to be causing inconsistencies and errors when dealing with ambiguous timestamps.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should be updated to properly handle ambiguous timestamps and ensure that the time bins are correctly aligned with the given time frequency. Additionally, it might be necessary to update the handling of timestamps and time zones to prevent errors related to ambiguous time.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use the Grouper class method to handle start and end timestamps
    first, last = self._get_time_range_edges(ax)

    # Generate time bins while considering the closed end
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        label=self.label,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins considering timestamps and closed end
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on closed end and presence of NaT values
    labels = self._adjust_labels(labels, binner)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By using `self._get_time_range_edges`, the function addresses the issue with the timestamps, and the corrected version is expected to handle the ambiguous timestamps more effectively. This corrected version should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue and pass the failing test case.
