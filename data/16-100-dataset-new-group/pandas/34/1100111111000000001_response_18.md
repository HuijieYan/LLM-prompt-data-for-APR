The buggy function `_get_time_bins` seems to be failing when trying to generate time bins. The bug might be related to how the time range edges are being calculated and then used to create the bins. 

The function appears to calculate the time range edges using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function, and then it proceeds to use these calculated edges to create the time bins. However, there might be a discrepancy or an inconsistency in the way the edges are calculated and used to create the bins.

The `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function calculates the first and last time range edges by using the `ax.min()` and `ax.max()` values from the input `ax`. The method `_adjust_bin_edges` is then called to adjust the bin edges, and then the bins are generated based on these adjusted edges.

The bug seems to be related to the discrepancy between how the time range edges are calculated and used to create the bins, which might result in incorrect bins being generated.

To fix the bug, the calculation of the time range edges and the subsequent creation of bins need to be reviewed to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        closed=self.closed,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `first` and `last` values are obtained directly from the `ax` object, and the `date_range` function is used to create the time bins based on the calculated range edges. This should ensure consistency and accuracy in generating the time bins.
