## A corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/resample.py

# corrected function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right":
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

After analyzing the buggy function, the failing test, the corresponding error message, the runtime input/output variable values, and the GitHub issue, the cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function was incorrectly adding an extra hour after the clock change in Cuba, leading to an ambiguous time error. This error was happening because of an incorrect calculation of time bins during the resampling process, which failed to handle a problematic time zone change.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function (given above) uses the `date_range` function with correct parameter values to ensure that time bins are correctly represented without adding extra hours due to ambiguous times. This corrected function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and pass the failing test case provided.

Please note that this fix may need to be reviewed and tested thoroughly in a local environment before being implemented in the actual codebase.
