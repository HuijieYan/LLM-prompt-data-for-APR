The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in pandas. The function takes a DatetimeIndex `ax` and performs several operations to calculate time bins and labels for the given frequency and closed end of the interval.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of input parameters and relevant variables before the function's return, it seems that the bug might be related to how the labels are being created and adjusted based on the frequency and closed end of the interval.

The cause of the bug might be related to the incorrect calculation of `bin_edges` and `bins` based on the input parameters and `ax` values, leading to incorrect labels being generated.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could be to review the calculation of `bin_edges` and ensure that it aligns with the frequency and closed end of the interval. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the labels are correctly adjusted based on the closed end and frequency to accurately represent the time bins.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,  # Use the closed end in date_range
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Re-calculate bins based on adjusted bin_edges
    bins = np.searchsorted(bin_edges, ax_values, side=self.closed)

    labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected version, the calculation of `bin_edges` is adjusted based on the closed end, and the labels are also adjusted accordingly. The `np.searchsorted` function is used to calculate the bins based on the adjusted `bin_edges`. Additionally, the closed end is passed to the `date_range` function to ensure that it aligns with the closed end of the interval.
