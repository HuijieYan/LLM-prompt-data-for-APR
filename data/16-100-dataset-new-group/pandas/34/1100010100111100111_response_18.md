The error message and the GitHub issue indicate that the bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on a clock-change day in Cuba. The function `_get_time_bins` is used to get time bins for grouping, and the error occurs due to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. 

The cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function does not handle ambiguous time properly, resulting in an error when trying to group the data. This is due to the fact that local time in Cuba has a closely spaced transition due to a clock-change (daylight saving time), leading to an ambiguous timestamp which is not properly handled by the `date_range` function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times explicitly and ensure that the `date_range` generates appropriate time bins.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().ceil(self.freq)
    
    # Handle ambiguous time explicitly
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bins, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    return binner, bins, bins
```

In the corrected version, we use the `floor` and `ceil` methods to handle ambiguous time explicitly and generate appropriate time bins. We also use the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to handle ambiguous times by replacing them with NaT (Not a Time) values. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
