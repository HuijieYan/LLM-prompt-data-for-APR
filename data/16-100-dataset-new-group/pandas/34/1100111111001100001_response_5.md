The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, as well as the adjustment of `labels` based on the `closed` and `label` attributes. A potential strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the `date_range` function is used correctly to generate the `binner` and `labels`, and that the adjustment of `labels` is handled properly based on the `closed` and `label` attributes.

Based on the provided runtime values and types, it seems that the `date_range` function may be producing incorrect values for `binner` and `labels`. Furthermore, there might be issues with the adjustment of `labels` based on the `closed` and `label` attributes, as evidenced by the incorrect values of `bins` and `labels` at the function's return.

To fix this bug, the `date_range` function should be called with the appropriate arguments to generate `binner` and `labels` correctly. Additionally, the adjustment of `labels` based on the `closed` and `label` attributes should be reviewed and updated if necessary to ensure the correct alignment.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first if self.closed == 'left' else ax[0],  # Adjust start based on closed attribute
        end=last if self.closed == 'left' else ax[-1],  # Adjust end based on closed attribute
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, adjustments have been made to the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, as well as the adjustment of `labels` based on the `closed` and `label` attributes.

Please test this corrected version with the failing test to ensure that the bug has been fixed.
