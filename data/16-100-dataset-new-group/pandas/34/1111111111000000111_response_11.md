### Bug Analysis
- The bug occurs when the code attempts to group time intervals that include ambiguous timestamps, such as during a time change.
- The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` demonstrates the issue when attempting to group hourly data into daily intervals.
- The issue on GitHub describes a similar problem related to ambiguous timestamps in time zone conversions, providing an expectation of 3 distinct groups but encountering an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Potential Error Location
- The bug likely occurs in the `TimeGrouper._get_time_bins` function, specifically when creating the binner, labels, and bins for the grouped time intervals.
- The use of `date_range` with a `closed` frequency and ambiguous timestamps may lead to incorrect intervals.

### Cause of the Bug
- The bug arises due to the mishandling of ambiguous timestamps when creating the date range for grouping.
- This causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to group the data into daily intervals, as observed in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Suggested Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the logic for creating the binner, bins, and labels to handle ambiguous timestamps properly.
- Consider handling ambiguous timestamps explicitly, ensuring that the date ranges are created without errors in the presence of such timestamps.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version focuses on handling ambiguous times explicitly by specifying the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function. This should ensure that the date ranges are created without errors when ambiguous timestamps are present.
