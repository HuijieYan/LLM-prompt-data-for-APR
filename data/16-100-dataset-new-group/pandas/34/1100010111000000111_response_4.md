The given function `_get_time_bins` seems to be encountering issues when dealing with the time zones and ambiguous time on midnight due to a clock change day in Cuba. The function is failing to handle the situation of ambiguous timestamps, leading to a `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to group the data using `pd.Grouper`. This problem is reflected in the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, which is meant to group the data by day but is running into trouble due to the ambiguous timestamp.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should handle the ambiguous time issue that arises due to the clock change day in Cuba, ensuring that it can correctly group the data without encountering an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

One approach to fix the bug is to incorporate handling for ambiguous timestamps when generating the bins and labels, as well as ensuring that the time zones are correctly managed within the `date_range` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
  
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Keep the original time zone of DatetimeIndex
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times in date_range
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Handle nonexistent times in date_range
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, `date_range` is configured to handle ambiguous and nonexistent times, ensuring that it won't encounter the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data. Additionally, the function retains the original time zone information from the input `DatetimeIndex` when generating the bins and labels.

By implementing these changes, the function should be able to handle the clock change day in Cuba when grouping the data, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and ensuring that the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` will pass.
