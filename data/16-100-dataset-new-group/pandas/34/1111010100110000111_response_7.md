#### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, corresponding error message, the GitHub issue:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the class `TimeGrouper`. This class forms a part of the `pandas` library and deals with time-interval grouping. The error message is linked to a problem with time conversion in the `pd.Grouper` method, which makes use of the `_get_time_bins` method. The GitHub issue highlights the user's expectation, which is not being met due to clock changes in specific time zones.

#### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
The specific error in the code is likely related to the method `date_range`, which is used to generate a range of dates. This method might not be handling ambiguous timestamps resulting from the clock changes correctly.

#### Explaining the cause of the bug:
The bug causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised when trying to group dates with a daily frequency, especially on clock change days in specific time zones. This error is due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during time conversion, likely related to the use of the `date_range` method.

#### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the way ambiguous timestamps are handled during time conversion, particularly in the context of the `date_range` method. One approach could be to explicitly handle the ambiguous timestamps by adjusting them to account for the time zone's clock changes.

#### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner, bins = self._get_binner_for_time(ax, first, last)

    return binner, bins, binner

def _get_binner_for_time(self, ax, start, end):
    binner = date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins
```

In the corrected version, the `date_range` method is used to create the time bins with the appropriate adjustments for ambiguous timestamps, and the `_get_binner_for_time` method handles the actual generation of the bins. These adjustments will help to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping dates with a daily frequency.
