The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function appears to be part of a larger resampling feature in the pandas library.

The error message is a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` which is raised when pandas is trying to infer the daylight saving time from a specific datetime but there are repeated times, making it ambiguous. This error likely occurs when resampling a time series with ambiguous times like during daylight saving time transitions.

The potential error locations within the function could be in the `date_range` and `lib.generate_bins_dt64` sections, where the handling of daylight saving time is not explicit.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the datetime ranges are properly adjusted for daylight saving times. The correction should incorporate logic to handle ambiguous times by explicitly specifying how to address these in the time bins.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        unique_times = ax.drop_duplicates()
        first, last = unique_times.min(), unique_times.max()
        
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="NaT",  # Set ambiguous times to NaT
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected function, we make changes to explicitly handle ambiguous times by setting the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to "NaT" so that ambiguous times are marked as NaT (Not a Time). This should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.

By making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and handle ambiguous times correctly when creating time bins for resampling.
