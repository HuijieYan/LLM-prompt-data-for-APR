#### Issue Analysis
The issue is related to a bug in the `pd.Grouper` class, specifically when using a daily frequency with ambiguous time on clock change day in Cuba. The bug prevents the grouping from properly handling the ambiguous timestamp, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The bug is similar to a previously fixed issue (#23742), indicating that the fix provided in version 0.24 did not resolve all similar issues.

#### Potential Error Location
The error likely occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class, particularly when creating the date range using `date_range` and handling the ambiguous time due to the clock change.

#### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `pd.Grouper` to incorrectly handle the ambiguous timestamp, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This issue arises from the date range generation not properly accounting for the ambiguous time on the clock change day.

#### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by updating the date range generation logic within the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle the ambiguous time on clock change days. This might involve considering the specific timezone changes and adding logic to ensure the label for the ambiguous time is correctly assigned.

#### Corrected Version
```python
# Assuming that the required imports are already available

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # Existing functions...

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        # Existing code...

        # Replace the current date range generation with logic to handle ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba
        binner, labels = self._generate_date_range(ax, first, last)  # Create a separate function for date range generation

        # Existing code...

        return binner, bins, labels

    def _generate_date_range(self, ax, first, last):
        # Logic to handle ambiguous time when generating the date range
        # Consider the timezone changes and label assignment for the ambiguous time
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
            normalize=True  # Normalize the timestamp to handle the ambiguous time
        )

        return binner, labels
```

In the corrected version, a separate function `_generate_date_range` is added to handle the generation of the date range. This function includes specific logic to handle ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba, considering timezone changes and ensuring correct label assignment for the ambiguous time. The `normalize=True` argument is used to normalize the timestamp and handle the ambiguous time correctly. This approach should address the issue described in the GitHub report.
