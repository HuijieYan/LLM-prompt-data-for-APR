The bug occurs when the buggy function `_get_time_bins` is called, and it fails to generate the correct binner, bins, and labels. The bug is likely related to the incorrect assignment and manipulation of time values and time zone information.

In the buggy function, the value of `first` and `last` is directly derived using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function, which should return the start and end of the time range. However, the bug may be caused by incorrect time zone handling during the calculation. This may lead to discrepancies in the generated time bins, which results in incorrect labels and bins.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the time zone information is correctly handled throughout the calculations. This includes checking the time zone information when creating the `first` and `last` timestamps, as well as aligning the time zone information when generating `binner` and `labels`.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Ensure time zone information is preserved
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the time zone information is explicitly passed when creating the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. Additionally, care should be taken to ensure that proper time zone adjustments are made when dealing with the time edge computations and label adjustments to avoid discrepancies.
