### Analysis:
- The failing test is trying to downsample data using `pd.Grouper` with a frequency of "1D" (1 day).
- The error message points to an AmbiguousTimeError, which arises when trying to infer daylight saving time (DST) from a timestamp. This occurs because the code does not handle ambiguous timestamps properly.
- The GitHub issue confirms this bug, indicating that the group for the day of the clock change in Cuba should be labeled correctly and should contain the data points for that day.
- The bug seems to be located in the `_get_time_bins` function, specifically in the handling of the timestamp range. It does not account for ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time transitions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the failure of the `pd.Grouper` to handle ambiguous timestamps during transitions in daylight saving time. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to infer the DST time from a timestamp.

### Fix Strategy:
The `_get_time_bins` function should be updated to handle ambiguous timestamps properly during daylight saving time transitions. It should account for the time zone changes and label the groups correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Correction in the _get_time_bins function to handle the AmbiguousTimeError
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Handle ambiguous times during DST transitions
    if ax.tz is not None:
        first = ax.tz.normalize(first)
        last = ax.tz.normalize(last)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By handling the ambiguous times during DST transitions and normalizing the timestamps based on the timezone information, this corrected version should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and produce the expected output, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
