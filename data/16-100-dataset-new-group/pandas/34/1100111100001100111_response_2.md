## Bug cause and fix

The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is caused by the usage of `date_range` to generate the bin edges based on the start and end timestamps, especially on ambiguous days with clock changes. This issue triggers an `AmbiguousTimeError`, which is related to the problem reported in the GitHub issue where groupby with daily frequency fails on clock change days in Cuba.

To fix this bug, we need to introduce a robust mechanism to handle the potential ambiguity in the generated bin edges, especially on days affected by the clock change. One approach to achieve this is by using `Timestamp.tz_localize`, then `Timestamp.tz_convert` to handle the timezone for the start and end times more intuitively.

### Correction for the buggy function

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    start = ax[0].tz_localize(None).tz_convert(ax.tz)
    end = ax[-1].tz_localize(None).tz_convert(ax.tz)
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        start, end, self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this correction, the start and end times are handled with compensations for timezone adjustments, reducing the likelihood of causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This should address the issue reported on the GitHub thread related to the problem with daily frequency on days affected by clock changes in Cuba.
