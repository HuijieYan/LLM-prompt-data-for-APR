## The bug
The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The function fails to handle the transition from standard time to daylight savings time, resulting in an ambiguous time error when the data is being resampled. This is due to the `date_range` function being used to generate bins based on the start and end times, which doesn't account for the transition. Additionally, the labels and binner arrays are not properly adjusted to handle the transition, leading to mismatched sizes and a potential error condition. This ultimately results in an ambiguous time error being raised.

## Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to account for the transition from standard time to daylight savings time. This involves using the `DatetimeIndex` to generate the bins and properly adjust the labels and binner arrays. Proper handling of the transition and adjustment of the arrays should prevent the raising of ambiguous time errors.

## The corrected function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Generate bins using DatetimeIndex to account for the transition
    binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=ax, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected function, we use `DatetimeIndex` to generate the `binner` and `labels` arrays, ensuring that they properly handle the transition from standard time to daylight savings time. Additionally, we adjust the `labels` array to match the size of the `bins` array, preventing potential errors.

By making these modifications, the corrected function should address the original bug and prevent the ambiguous time error from occurring.
