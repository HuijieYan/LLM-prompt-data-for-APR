The bug in the code is causing an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group data with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. This bug has been reported on GitHub where the expected output is not being achieved due to the datetime being an ambiguous timestamp. The bug is leading to an error and is not handled correctly.

The cause of the bug is linked to the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class. The issue arises due to inconsistent labeling of the timestamp on the clock change day, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group the data.

To fix the bug, the labeling and adjustment of the timestamp on the clock change day need to be corrected. The code should handle the ambiguous time by labeling it appropriately without causing an error.

Given the analysis and the cause of the bug, here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous time
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `ambiguous` parameter is set to "NaT" to handle ambiguous times appropriately. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the grouping with daily frequency on clock change days in Cuba works as expected.
