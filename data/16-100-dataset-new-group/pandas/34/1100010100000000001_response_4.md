The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:

1. The use of `binner` and `labels` interchangeably without checking their correctness.
2. The manipulation of `binner` and `labels` after they have been assigned.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly manipulating the `binner` and `labels` variables without properly checking their validity and consistency with each other.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `binner` and `labels` variables are correctly generated and manipulated, and to check their lengths and validity before performing any operations on them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the function ensures that the `binner` and `labels` are correctly generated, and their lengths are properly checked before any operations are performed on them. Additionally, the manipulation of `binner` and `labels` has been corrected to ensure their consistency.
