In the buggy function `_get_time_bins`, there seems to be an issue with handling ambiguous times, specifically on a clock change day in Cuba. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is an `AmbiguousTimeError`. Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem arises from the fact that the timestamp at midnight local time is ambiguous on a long clock-change day in Cuba. The expected output is the creation of three groups, one for each day, with the group for the 4th of November being labeled as the first midnight before the clock change and containing the hourly data points for that day.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the ambiguous timestamp at midnight local time on the clock-change day in Cuba. To do this, we can explicitly handle the ambiguous time during the creation of the datetime index using a `tz` parameter and set `ambiguous` to `'infer'`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use start and end timestamps directly to handle the ambiguous time
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, 
        end=last, 
        freq=self.freq, 
        tz=ax.tz, 
        name=ax.name, 
        ambiguous='infer'  # Handle ambiguous times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By explicitly handling the ambiguous time during the creation of the datetime index, the corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test.
