### Bug Cause and Fix Strategy
The bug is caused by the code's handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically on a long clock-change day in Cuba. The issue is that the call to `groupby` raises an AmbiguousTimeError due to the way the binner and labels are generated, causing discrepancies in the bin edges and resulting in more labels than bins. The root cause could be due to the handling of daylight saving time (DST) transitions. 

To fix the bug, it's essential to address how the binner and labels are generated to properly handle ambiguous timestamps caused by DST transitions. Additionally, the adjustment of bin edges and the handling of labels when there are more labels than bins need to be appropriately managed.

To address this, the corrected version of the function will include modifications in the generation of binner and labels, adjustment of bin edges, and handling of labels when more labels than bins are observed.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the analysis, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Generate binner and labels to handle ambiguous timestamps
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last + pd.Timedelta('1D'),  # Ensure to include the entire period
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name
    )
    labels = binner[:-1]  # Generate appropriate labels based on binner

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, adjustments have been made to handle ambiguous timestamps caused by DST transitions by explicitly including the entire period and generating appropriate labels based on binner.

This corrected version aims to address the issue reported in the GitHub bug. However, thorough testing and validation should be performed to ensure that the corrected function resolves the problem.
