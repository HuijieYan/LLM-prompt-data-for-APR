The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `_get_timestamp_range_edges()` function call within the `_get_time_bins()` function may be causing the bug.
2. The adjustment of bin edges and binning process may also be resulting in the bug.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the binning process in the `_get_time_bins()` function. This causes the incorrect calculation of bins and labels, leading to the failing test.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Review the calculation of bins and labels within the `_get_time_bins()` function and ensure that the binning process correctly aligns with the specified frequency and time range.

Corrected version of the `_get_time_bins()` function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max() + self.freq - pd.Timedelta("1ns")  # Adjust last to include the end value
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
        )
    
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins(ax.asi8, bin_edges, closed=self.closed)
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = DatetimeIndex([NaT], freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name).append(binner)
            labels = DatetimeIndex([NaT], freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name).append(labels)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments to the first and last timestamps, as well as the binning process, have been carefully reviewed and revised to ensure the correct calculation of bins and labels. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
