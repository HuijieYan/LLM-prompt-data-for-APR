## Correction Strategy
The bug is causing an AmbiguousTimeError due to an issue with how the grouper function handles time intervals, particularly on days with clock changes. This is further verified by the GitHub issue report, which highlights the problem with clock changes in Cuba.

The main issue is caused by the bin edges and labeling on ambiguous clock change days. The bin edges are being calculated, but the labels for these edges are not being set correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To resolve this, a correction should be made in the `_get_time_bins` function to ensure that the labels are correctly assigned for days with ambiguous timestamps due to clock changes. The correction will involve adjusting the label assignment based on the context of the ambiguous time.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug by properly handling ambiguous timestamps caused by clock changes, ensuring that the grouping operation works as expected.
