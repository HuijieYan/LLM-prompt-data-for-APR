## Fixing the bug in the buggy function based on the GitHub issue and the provided code sample

### Issue Analysis:
From the GitHub issue, it is clear that the bug arises in the `pd.Grouper` class due to the handling of ambiguous time stamps on certain clock change days. The bug results in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

### Potential Error Location:
The error might occur in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class where it selects the time bins for grouping.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the current implementation of time bin generation in the `_get_time_bins` function does not handle ambiguous time stamps correctly, which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` in the `pd.Grouper` class for certain time intervals.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The fix should involve updating the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous time stamps properly by using the frequency and time-specific information to determine the correct time bins. Also, allowing for the handling of ambiguous time stamps based on the timezone information.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    binner, _, labels, _ = ax._get_grouper_for_time_zone(self.freq, closed=self.closed, label=self.label)
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```
The corrected version of the function now leverages the capability of the `DatetimeIndex` object to get the correct time bins handling ambiguous time stamps based on the given frequency and time zone information.

This updated approach should resolve the issue presented in the GitHub post by correctly handling ambiguous time stamps when creating time bins in the `pd.Grouper` class.

By incorporating this fix, the `AmbiguousTimeError` should be resolved, and the `pd.Grouper` class should function as expected, producing the correct groups for the given time intervals.
