In the error message, we can see that the `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised due to the date range conversion because there are no repeated times. This error is raised when handling time series data and time intervals, particularly during the conversion of time zones or date ranges.

Looking at the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class, the bug seems to be related to how the date range is created using the `date_range` function, especially when handling ambiguous and nonexistent time issues. The error is occurring when attempting to infer the DST time from a specific date, and it is due to the lack of repeated times in the given date range, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the date range is constructed to avoid ambiguous time issues. Specifically, we may need to adjust the input parameters or handle the ambiguous and nonexistent time settings more effectively.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq).to_pydatetime()
    last = ax.max().floor(self.freq).to_pydatetime()

    # Use the shifted start param for `date_range` to avoid ambiguous time issues
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        closed=self.closed,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='NaT',
        nonexistent='shift_forward'
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, we modified the way the date range is created by converting the first and last values to Python `datetime` objects, and using the `floor` method to avoid ambiguous time issues. Additionally, we adjusted the ambiguous and nonexistent time settings to handle potential ambiguous time problems more effectively.
