The error message indicates that there is an issue with inferring the DST time from the datetime index. This suggests that the problem lies in the handling of time zone transitions in the `_get_time_bins` function.

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used to generate time bins for resampling based on a given frequency. It includes handling time zone information and inferring the bin edges from the input datetime index. The error message indicates an issue with inferring the DST time at a specific point in the datetime index.

The bug is likely related to how the time zone transitions within the datetime index are being handled when inferring the bin edges. An ambiguous time error suggests that the function is encountering a situation where the time zone transitions are ambiguous, leading to an error in inferring the bin edges.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that time zone transitions are handled correctly when inferring the bin edges. This may involve refining the logic for handling time zone transitions and addressing ambiguous time situations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # The following code infers the bin edges while handling time zone transitions
    first = ax[0].tz_localize(None)
    last = ax[-1].tz_localize(None)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Preserve the original timezone
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the handling of time zone transitions has been refined to ensure that the bin edges are inferred accurately without encountering ambiguous time errors. This is achieved by explicitly localizing the initial and final datetime values to remove the time zone information before inferring the bin edges.
