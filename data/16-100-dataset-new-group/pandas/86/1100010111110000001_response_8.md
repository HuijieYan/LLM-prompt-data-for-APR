The buggy function is `pivot` which is used to pivot a DataFrame object. The failing test case `test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error` is expecting an error to be raised when calling `df.pivot(index="col1", values="col3")`, and the error message is indicating a KeyError.

Upon inspection of the buggy function, the potential causes of the bug are as follows:
1. The function does not handle the case where `columns` is None and `values` is not None, as is required in the failing test case.

It is evident from the error message that when the `columns` parameter is None and `values` is not None, the KeyError is being raised. This is because the function does not handle this specific case and may be trying to access data at the `None` index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle the situation where `columns` is None and `values` is not None without raising a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `pivot` function:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]

        if columns is None:
            columns = data.columns

        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)

    return indexed.unstack(columns)
``` 

In this corrected version, a check has been added to handle the case where `columns` is None and `values` is not None. It ensures that the `columns` are set to `data.columns` in this condition, preventing the KeyError from being raised.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
