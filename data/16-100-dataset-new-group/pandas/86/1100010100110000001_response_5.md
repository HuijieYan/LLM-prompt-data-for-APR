The function pivot is trying to access the get_loc method of the self object and being a pandas index based method, it expects the key to be present in the index where it is being applied. However, in the failing test, the key appears to be None, which leads to the KeyError: None error message.

Given this information, it seems that the `index` parameter is expected to be a valid column name from the input data DataFrame. However, in the failing test, the `index` parameter is set to "col1", which is not an index column. This results in None being passed as the key and subsequently causing the KeyError.

A potential fix for the bug is to ensure that the `index` parameter is actually a valid column from the input data DataFrame. If it's not, an appropriate error should be raised to prompt the user to provide the correct column name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

# this is the corrected function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        if index is not None and index not in data.columns:
            raise ValueError("The specified index column should be present in the input data.")
            
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None or index not in data.columns:
            raise ValueError("The specified index column should be present in the input data.")
        
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([data[index], data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(data[values].values, index=index, columns=values)
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that the specified index column is present in the input data DataFrame. If not, a ValueError is raised, providing specific guidance on what went wrong. This should prevent passing None as the key and causing the KeyError as seen in the failing test.
