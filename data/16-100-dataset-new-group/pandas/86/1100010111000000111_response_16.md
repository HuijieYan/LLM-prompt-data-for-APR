The issue with the `pivot` function is that it does not correctly handle the case where `columns` is None, which is not allowed according to the documentation. Additionally, the error message when `columns` is None is confusing and should be improved.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `pivot` function to correctly handle the case where `columns` is None and also improve the error message.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

# this is the corrected function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

The corrected function now checks if `columns` is None and raises a TypeError with a clear error message if it is. This ensures that an error is raised when `columns` is omitted, as intended by the documentation.

With this corrected function, the failing test case provided should now pass, and the error message should be more informative and align with the expected behavior.

Additionally, the improved error message aligns with the GitHub issue, resolving the problem of the confusing error message when `columns` is None.

This fix addresses the issue and should resolve the bug identified in the GitHub issue.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions or issues!
