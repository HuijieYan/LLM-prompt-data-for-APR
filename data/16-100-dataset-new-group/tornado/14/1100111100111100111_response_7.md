Based on the provided information, the buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance. The issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, causing the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current IOLoop instance.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function incorrectly checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance. When `make_current` is `True`, it mistakenly raises a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    # other class methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # Adjusted the conditional logic here
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for the presence of a current IOLoop
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, when `make_current` is set to `True`, it will correctly check if a current IOLoop instance exists. If it does, it will raise a `RuntimeError`. If not, it will proceed to make the IOLoop instance current.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
