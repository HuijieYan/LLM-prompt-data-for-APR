The buggy function is the `initialize` function within the `ioloop.py` file in the `tornado` project. The function checks whether the current IOLoop already exists and if not, it initializes and makes it the current IOLoop.

The potential error is in the conditional statements that check whether `make_current` is None and whether `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. The function then raises a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop already exists, which is contradictory to the check for `None`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is checking for the existence of the current IOLoop in an incorrect manner, and the conditional statements are not handling the logic properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop and handle the logic appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_ioloop`. Then we modify the conditional statements to correctly check if `current_ioloop` is `None` and handle the logic accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
