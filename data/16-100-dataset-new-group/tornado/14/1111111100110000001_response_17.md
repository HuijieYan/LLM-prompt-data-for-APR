The bug in the `initialize` function is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised. The `initialize` function is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.

The `initialize` function takes an argument `make_current`, and when it is set to `True`, it should check if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist before making the new instance current. However, the bug is that it is not correctly checking if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

The bug occurs in the conditional statement `if make_current`, where it attempts to check if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist. It fails to do so correctly, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement that checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and reverse the condition to check if it does exist and raise an error when `make_current` is `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test for the `initialize` function should pass.
