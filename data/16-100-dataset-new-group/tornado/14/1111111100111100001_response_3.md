The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition for checking the existing current `IOLoop` instance. 

When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". However, the condition checks with the `instance=False` argument, which causes the check to always return `None`, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition inside the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the `initialize` function now correctly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
