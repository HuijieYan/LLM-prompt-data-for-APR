The issue with the current implementation is that when `make_current` is True, it should check if an instance already exists, and if so, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. Additionally, it should make the current instance using the `self.make_current()` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, when `make_current` is True, it checks if an instance already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it calls `self.make_current()` to make the current instance.

With this correction, the failing test should pass as the logic in the `initialize` function now correctly checks if an instance already exists and handles the `make_current` parameter appropriately.
