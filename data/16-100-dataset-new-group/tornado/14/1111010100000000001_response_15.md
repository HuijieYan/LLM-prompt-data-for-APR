The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the `IOLoop` class. It is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object by making it the current IOLoop if the `make_current` parameter is `True`, and if it is `None`, then it should become the current instance only if there is no current `IOLoop`. However, there are a couple of potential error locations within the function:

1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should use `self` instead of the class name `IOLoop`.
2. The `self.make_current()` method may not be implemented correctly, and thus might cause further errors.

The cause of the bug is that the method checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` using the class name instead of the instance itself. Additionally, the `self.make_current()` method might not be implemented correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to use `self` for checking the current `IOLoop` instance, and ensure that the `make_current` method is implemented correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we've replaced `IOLoop.current` with `self.current` to use the instance instead of the class for checking the current `IOLoop`. We assume that the `make_current` method is implemented correctly, so we call it using `self.make_current()`.
