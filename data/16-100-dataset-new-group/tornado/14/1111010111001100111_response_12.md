### Bug Analysis
The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance and make it the current instance if required. The bug seems to be related to how the `make_current` argument is being handled, taking into account the checks for the existing current instance. Based on the failing test, the issue seems to be with the handling of the `make_current` argument and the checking of the current instance.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Handling of the `make_current` argument
2. Condition for checking the existing current instance

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument. When `make_current=True`, the code is not properly checking for the existing current instance before attempting to make the current instance. This leads to the failing test case where an error is raised for the second construction attempt, even though the current instance is not affected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `initialize` function should properly handle the `make_current` argument. It should first check if there is an existing current instance and then take appropriate action based on the value of `make_current`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    # Check if make_current is True and there is no existing current instance
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        # Make the current instance
        else:
            self.make_current()
    # Check if make_current is None and there is no existing current instance
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```
