The issue appears to be a problem with the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The failing test `test_force_current` is attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists. However, the current implementation of the `initialize` method does not handle this correctly, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the `make_current` argument is not being checked properly in the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is `True`, the method should check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and then raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the existing implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior and the `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` method should be updated to properly handle the `make_current` argument and check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. If it exists and `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` method should now correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the existing `IOLoop` instance, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
