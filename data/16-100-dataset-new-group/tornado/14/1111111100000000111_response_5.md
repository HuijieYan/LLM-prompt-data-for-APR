Potential Error Locations:
- The condition `if make_current is None:` in the `initialize` function.
- The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` within the `initialize` function.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the `initialize` function is called with `make_current` set to `None`. In this case, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if it is, it calls the `make_current` method. However, when `make_current` is `None`, the function incorrectly raises a RuntimeError that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The `initialize` function should only call the `make_current` method if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `None`, it should not perform any action.

Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
