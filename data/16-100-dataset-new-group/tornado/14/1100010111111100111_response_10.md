Based on the failing test, error message, and runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug is occurring when `make_current` is set to True. The current logic in the `initialize` function is causing a RuntimeError to be raised even when `make_current` is set to True and the IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None.

The bug seems to be in the logic where it checks if the current IOLoop already exists. This logic seems to be conflicting with the intention of the `make_current` parameter.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current IOLoop existence needs to be revised. Instead of checking if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, the function should directly proceed with making the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to True.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the function will first check if `make_current` is True, and if it is, it will go ahead and set the IOLoop to be current without checking for its existence. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
