The bug in the initialize function is causing the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists". This error occurs when the make_current parameter is True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, which means that the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the initialize function to correctly handle the make_current parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:  # If make_current is not specified
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # If current IOLoop does not exist
            self.make_current()  # Call make_current to set the current IOLoop
    else:
        if make_current:  # If make_current is explicitly set to True
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # If current IOLoop already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise RuntimeError
            self.make_current()  # Call make_current to set the current IOLoop
```

With this correction, the function should handle the make_current parameter properly and avoid the RuntimeError that was occurring during the failing test.
