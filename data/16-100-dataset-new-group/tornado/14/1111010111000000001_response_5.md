The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is failing the test case `test_force_current` in the `ioloop_test.py` file. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is True, and raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists. However, the function is not working as expected and is failing the test case.

The potential error location is within the conditional statements in the `initialize` function, specifically in the logic for checking `make_current` and the existing current IOLoop.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic in the `initialize` function doesn't correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop already exists. The function incorrectly checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and then tries to make it the current IOLoop, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop already exists. If `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError` without trying to make it the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should pass the failing test `test_force_current` in the `ioloop_test.py` file.
