The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter, resulting in the RuntimeError being raised. In the previous implementation, if `make_current` is True, the `initialize` function raises a RuntimeError if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, but it does not set the current instance to the instance being created.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to set the current `IOLoop` instance to the instance being created when `make_current` is True.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is True, we check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it does not exist, we set the current `IOLoop` instance to the instance being created using `self.make_current()`. If it already exists, we raise a RuntimeError as before.
