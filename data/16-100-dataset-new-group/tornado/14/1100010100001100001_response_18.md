### Bug Explanation
The buggy function has the following issues:
1. The `make_current` parameter is not being used correctly. The function checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, but it doesn't handle the case when `make_current` is `False`.
2. The function also checks if the current IOLoop exists, but it doesn't handle the case when it does exist.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case when `make_current` is `False`, and also properly handle the case when the current IOLoop already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
