### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance, and optionally make it the current instance. However, the bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` in this case, rather than allowing the current `IOLoop` instance to remain unchanged.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function incorrectly checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should first check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if `make_current` is `True`, it should not raise a `RuntimeError`. Instead, it should allow the current `IOLoop` instance to remain unchanged.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
```
