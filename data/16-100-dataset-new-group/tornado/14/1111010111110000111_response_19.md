### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the file `ioloop.py`. The failing test `test_force_current` attempts to create an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and then checks if the current `IOLoop` is affected. The specific error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is actually None.

### Potential Error Location:
- The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is causing the RuntimeError to be raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is actually None.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the fact that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not evaluating as expected, resulting in the RuntimeError being raised even when it should not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The condition checking for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` needs to be updated to correctly check for None and handle the situation accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ...
    """

    # The corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `initialize` function will correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance, and the RuntimeError will only be raised when the instance already exists, as intended.
