## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=False):
        if make_current is False:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original code occurs in the `initialize` function. The condition `if make_current is None` should be `if make_current is False` since the intention is to check if the argument `make_current` is explicitly set to `False`. Additionally, in the `elif make_current` block, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should be `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to check if the current IOLoop already exists before trying to make it current.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition `if make_current is None` to `if make_current is False`.
2. Update the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`.

The corrected function is provided above with these fixes.
