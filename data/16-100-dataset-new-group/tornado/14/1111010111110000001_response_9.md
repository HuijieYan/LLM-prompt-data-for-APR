The error in the initialize() function is caused by the current IOLoop already existing when make_current is set to True.

To fix this bug, we need to update the initialize() function to check whether the current IOLoop exists before calling make_current(). If it does, then a RuntimeError should be raised, otherwise the new IOLoop should be set as the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize() function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # corrected version of the buggy initialize function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the initialize() function, the failing test test_force_current() is expected to pass successfully without raising a RuntimeError.
