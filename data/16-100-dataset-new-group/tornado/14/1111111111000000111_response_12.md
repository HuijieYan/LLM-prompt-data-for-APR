## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if there is an existing current instance and either sets the current instance or raises an error if `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current instance.

The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then confirm that the instance is set as the current instance and that it raises an error when a second `make_current=True` construction is attempted.

The GitHub issue indicates that there is a problem with `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and why the error "already exists" is being raised.

## Potential Error Locations
The bug may be in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the subsequent logic to either set the current instance or raise an error.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. It is checking if the current instance is `None` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, but this condition is not correctly handling the case when `make_current=True`. It should only raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance, which is not being handled properly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be corrected to properly handle the `make_current` argument and the existing current instance.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `if make_current` condition checks if the current instance is not `None` and if so, raises the `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists. This should fix the bug and make the failing test `test_force_current` to pass.
