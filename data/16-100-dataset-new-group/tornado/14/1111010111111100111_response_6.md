Based on the error message, failing test, and analysis of the buggy function, it appears that the bug lies in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The issue is that when `make_current=True`, the function incorrectly raises an error even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. This behavior does not align with the intended logic, leading to the failing test case.

To fix the bug, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` needs to be corrected. It should only raise an error when `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`. Additionally, the call to `self.make_current()` should be removed as it is redundant.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By making these adjustments, the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test.

It's also important to consider the version of Tornado in which this issue was reported on GitHub. If necessary, the bug fix should be backported to the corresponding version.
