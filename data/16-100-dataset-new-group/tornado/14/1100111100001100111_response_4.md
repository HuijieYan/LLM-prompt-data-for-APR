The buggy function is `initialize` inside the `IOLoop` class. This function takes an optional `make_current` parameter. It first checks if `make_current` is None. If it is, it then checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None, it again checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if not, it raises a RuntimeError, otherwise it calls `self.make_current()`.

The issue on GitHub indicates that there is a problem with the check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. It seems that the function is raising a RuntimeError even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which contradicts the logic of the if statement.

Given the information and the error described on GitHub, it appears that the bug is in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` within the `initialize` function. It seems that the condition is not behaving as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is evaluated correctly. It's possible that the `current` function is not returning a None value when expected, leading to the unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
  if make_current is None:
      if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
          self.make_current()
  elif make_current:
      if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed the condition to check if current IOLoop exists
          raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
      self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, I changed the condition in the `elif` statement to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, which is consistent with the logic of the function and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
