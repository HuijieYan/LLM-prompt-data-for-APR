The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is causing the test `test_force_current` to fail. The `initialize` function is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop and make sure there is only one current instance at a time. However, it fails to do so, as it mistakenly raises a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` may not correctly handle the case when `make_current=False`.
2. The condition `elif make_current` may have an incorrect logic for checking the current IOLoop instance or raising a `RuntimeError`.

The cause of the bug is that in the `initialize` function, the logic to check for the current IOLoop and handle the `make_current` argument is not properly implemented. This is causing the test `test_force_current` to fail because the RuntimeError is incorrectly raised.

To fix the bug, instead of checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and raising a `RuntimeError`, the `initialize` function should simply call `self.make_current()` if `make_current=True` and there is no current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should have the expected behavior and pass the failing test `test_force_current`. The issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved with this correction.
