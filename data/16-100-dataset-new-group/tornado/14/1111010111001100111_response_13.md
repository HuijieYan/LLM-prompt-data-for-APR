The bug is located in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The issue is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then raises a `RuntimeError` saying "current IOLoop already exists", which is contradictory.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is being used both to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and also to determine if it does not exist.

To fix this bug, I suggest using a different conditional to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and creating a new instance only when it does not.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This fix makes sure that it only attempts to make the `IOLoop` instance current when `make_current` is `True` and it doesn't already exist, and it raises a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
