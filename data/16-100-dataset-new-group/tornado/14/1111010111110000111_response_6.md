The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The issue arises when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and checking the current instance. The error message shows that the test is expecting an error because the `current` instance already exists. However, the code incorrectly raises the `RuntimeError` even if the `current` instance is actually None. 

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` incorrectly checks if the `current` instance exists and raises an error even if it is `None`. This leads to the test failing and the `RuntimeError` being raised improperly.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement in the `initialize` method needs to be modified to only raise the `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and the `current` instance already exists. If `make_current` is not provided or is False, it should proceed without raising the error.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
With this correction, the `RuntimeError` will only be raised if `make_current` is True and the `current` instance actually exists. This will ensure that the test case `test_force_current` will pass and the GitHub issue will be resolved.
