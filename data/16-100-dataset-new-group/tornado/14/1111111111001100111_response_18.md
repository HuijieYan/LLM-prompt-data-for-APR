The issue is that the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument. The problem is that when `make_current` is True, it should check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to make itself current. However, the current implementation is not properly handling this condition.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` argument.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this version, we first retrieve the current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then we check the value of `make_current` and handle the logic accordingly:

- If `make_current` is None, we check if there is no current instance and make the current instance if there isn't.
- If `make_current` is True, we check if there is already a current instance and raise an error if there is, otherwise, we make the current instance.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
