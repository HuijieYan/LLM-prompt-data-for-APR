The problem with the `initialize` function is that it is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is intended to ensure that the IOLoop becomes the current IOLoop, but it is not doing this correctly.

The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is None or True, and in both cases, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, when `make_current` is None, it also checks if an IOLoop already exists and tries to make the current IOLoop if none exists. This logic leads to an error when attempting to force the current IOLoop.

To fix this bug:
1. Change the `initialize` function to only call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is explicitly True, and not at all if it is None.
2. Remove the unnecessary check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` before calling `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and only attempt to force the current IOLoop when `make_current` is explicitly True.
