The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class from the `tornado.ioloop` module is designed to initialize an IOLoop by setting it as the current instance. However, due to a bug in the `initialize` function, the error message "current IOLoop already exists" is raised even when the IOLoop is not already set as the current instance.

The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are:
1. In line 253, the `if make_current` condition is not handling the case where `make_current` is `False` but the current IOLoop already exists.
2. In line 254, the `raise RuntimeError` statement is incorrectly raising an error when the IOLoop is not already set as the current instance.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the scenario where `make_current` is `False` and the current IOLoop already exists. This leads to the erroneous RuntimeError being raised, causing the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to handle the case where `make_current` is `False` and the current IOLoop already exists. This can be achieved by checking for the existence of the current IOLoop before attempting to make the IOLoop current, and only raising an error if `make_current` is `True` and the IOLoop is already set as the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the scenarios where `make_current` is `True` or `False`, and the current IOLoop instance will be managed accordingly.

This corrected version of the `initialize` function will pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
