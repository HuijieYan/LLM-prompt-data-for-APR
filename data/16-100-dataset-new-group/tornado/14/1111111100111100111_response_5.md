To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the `make_current` argument to the `IOLoop` constructor works as expected. The current implementation of the `initialize` method is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised even when the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

The issue is related to the logic inside the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None before attempting to make it current. However, the current implementation is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even when the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the logic inside the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # This condition should be changed
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, for the `make_current=True` case, the condition is modified to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None before attempting to make it current. If it is not None, then a `RuntimeError` is raised as expected. This modification ensures that the `make_current` argument works as intended.

By making this change, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test should pass as expected.
