## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The function is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current instance if `make_current` is not provided or is set to `True`. However, the function is not behaving as expected and is causing the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Checking for the current instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
2. Conditional checks for `make_current` and the current instance.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the conditional checks for the current instance and the `make_current` argument are not working as intended. The function is not handling the case where `make_current` is `None` correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and the potential raise of a `RuntimeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional checks to handle the case where `make_current` is `None` and ensure that the current instance is handled properly in all scenarios.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the conditional checks to handle the case where `make_current` is `None` and ensured that the current instance is handled correctly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
