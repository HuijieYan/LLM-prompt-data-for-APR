The bug in the `initialize` function is that it raises a `RuntimeError` even when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. This is contrary to the intended behavior, which should only raise the error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a non-None value when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix this bug, we should update the conditional statement inside the `initialize` function to properly check for the condition when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current IOLoop instance already exists.

This correction should address the bug and make the function behave as intended, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
