The bug in the `initialize` function appears to be related to the `make_current` argument not being properly handled. It seems that the function is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if not, make the current instance. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it should also raise an error if a current IOLoop instance already exists.

The potential error locations are within the conditional statements checking the `make_current` argument and the function calls to `IOLoop.current()` and `self.make_current()`.

The bug seems to be caused by the mishandling of the `make_current` argument. The function is not correctly evaluating the conditions and is raising the error even when it shouldn't. This is evident from the failing test, which shows that a second call to `IOLoop(make_current=True)` is raising a `RuntimeError`, despite the first call to `IOLoop(make_current=True)` successfully setting the current instance.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statement to properly handle the `make_current` argument and the existing current IOLoop instance.

Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the `make_current` argument and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
