The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing the test function `test_force_current` to fail. The `initialize` function is meant to handle the initialization of the IOLoop and determine if it needs to be set as the current IOLoop. However, due to the buggy logic, it is not functioning as intended.

The `initialize` function has the following potential error locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might be incorrect.
2. The `make_current` argument handling might have logic issues.

The bug causes the `test_force_current` test to fail because the `make_current` option is not being handled properly. The current implementation is failing to properly check if the IOLoop is already set as the current IOLoop, leading to the `RuntimeError` being incorrectly raised.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `make_current` option needs to be revised. The `initialize` function should properly check if the IOLoop is already set as the current IOLoop before attempting to make it the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_ioloop is not None and current_ioloop is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists has been updated to properly handle the `make_current` option. This should resolve the issue and the failing test.
