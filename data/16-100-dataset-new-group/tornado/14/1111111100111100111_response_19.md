Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to the logic in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The issue seems to arise when `make_current` is set to `True` and the `IOLoop.current` function returns None, leading to a RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

The bug occurs in the initialize function's logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is set to True, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if it is, it raises a RuntimeError. However, this logic is incorrect because the check for None should indicate that no current instance exists, not the opposite.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be inverted for the `make_current` parameter. Instead of checking if the current instance is None and then raising an error, it should check if the current instance is not None and then raise an error if it is.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance is not None
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance is not None
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this logic inverted, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test while addressing the issue reported in GitHub.
