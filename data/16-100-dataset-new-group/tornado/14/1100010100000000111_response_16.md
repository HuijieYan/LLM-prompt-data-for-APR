Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` may not be checking for the correct condition.
2. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` may not be evaluated as expected.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the condition that checks if an IOLoop instance already exists. If the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is evaluating to True, it should not raise an error for "current IOLoop already exists". This is contradictory and needs to be fixed.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition `if make_current is None` to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance in a clearer way.
2. Review the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to ensure it is properly evaluating the current IOLoop instance.

Corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:  # Updated the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance exists
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditions to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance in a clearer way, the bug should be resolved. The first condition now checks if the current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to make it current, and the second condition raises an error only if the current IOLoop instance does exist when attempting to make it current.
