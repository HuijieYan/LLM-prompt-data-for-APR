The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the `test_force_current` test to fail. The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance, but it has a conditional block that incorrectly handles the `make_current` parameter. It checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it calls the `make_current()` method. However, if `make_current` is True, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop instance is not None. But the actual behavior is the opposite.

The issue on GitHub highlights the confusion in the logic of the `initialize` function and how it handles the current IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the `initialize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the necessary correction in the conditional block for `make_current`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised when the current IOLoop instance exists and `make_current` is True.

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
