The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if so, raise a `RuntimeError`. If there is no current instance, it should then make itself the current `IOLoop`. 

The bug in the function is that it is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. It only checks if there is no current instance and then makes itself the current instance, but it should also check and raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to include this check. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After making this fix, the function should pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
