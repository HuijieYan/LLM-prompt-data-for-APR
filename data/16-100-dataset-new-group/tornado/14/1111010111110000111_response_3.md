To fix the bug in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, we need to address the conditional checks for `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. The failing test indicates that the `RuntimeError` "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised inappropriately.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks for `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` are not properly synchronized, leading to the premature raising of the `RuntimeError`. This is reflected in the failing test and the error message, which points to a conditional mismatch in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` method to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised only when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the conditional checks are properly synchronized, ensuring that the `RuntimeError` is raised only when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
