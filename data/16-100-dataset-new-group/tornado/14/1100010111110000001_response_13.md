The bug in the initialize function is that it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance using the instance=False argument, which causes it to always create a new IOLoop instance even when make_current=True. This results in the RuntimeError being raised when trying to force the current IOLoop.

To fix the bug, the initialize function should be modified to correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and set it if make_current=True.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function should now correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance, and the RuntimeError should no longer be raised when forcing the current IOLoop.
