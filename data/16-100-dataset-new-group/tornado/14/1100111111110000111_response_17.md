The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is incorrectly checking if the current IOLoop already exists. When `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if an IOLoop instance already exists. But the current implementation is not correctly handling this condition.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` and raises an error if it exists. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the failing test pass.
