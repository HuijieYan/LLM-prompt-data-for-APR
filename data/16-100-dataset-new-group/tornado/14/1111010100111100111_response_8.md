The bug within the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised when `make_current` is set to `True`. This is occurring because the `IOLoop.current` function is returning `None`, triggering the conditional statement to raise an error, despite the value being `True`.

The cause of the bug is that the logic within the `initialize` function does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

To fix this bug, the logic within the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop does not exist (i.e., it is not None) has been updated to ensure that the error is only raised if the current IOLoop already exists. This should resolve the issue and prevent the `RuntimeError` from being raised when `make_current` is set to `True`.
