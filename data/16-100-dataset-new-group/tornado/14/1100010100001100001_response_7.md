### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current IOLoop. However, the function has a logical error where it checks for the current IOLoop instance when make_current is True, and if it exists, it raises a RuntimeError. This logic is incorrect because when make_current is True, it should actually make the IOLoop the current one, rather than checking if it already exists.

### Bug
The bug in the function is that when make_current is True, it incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and raises an error if it does.

### Fix
I will modify the function to directly make the IOLoop the current one when make_current is True, without checking if it already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
