# The cause of the bug:
The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance, and it takes a `make_current` argument to control whether the new `IOLoop` should become the current one. The bug seems to be in the `initialize` function where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None to decide whether to make the new `IOLoop` instance the current one, but this logic seems to be flawed, as it always attempts to make the new instance the current one irrespective of the current state.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
The `initialize` function should be modified to correctly check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then decide whether to make the new instance the current one based on the value of the `make_current` argument. It should also handle the case when `make_current` is not provided.

# The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the `initialize` function checks if the `make_current` argument is provided and then performs the necessary checks based on the state of the current `IOLoop` instance.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and also pass the failing test.
