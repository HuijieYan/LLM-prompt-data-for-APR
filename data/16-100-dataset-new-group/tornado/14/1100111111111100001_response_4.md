The bug in the initialize function is that it does not properly handle the make_current parameter. When make_current is True, it should check if an IOLoop instance already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the make_current parameter. When make_current is True, we should check if an IOLoop instance already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. If make_current is None, it should default to creating a new IOLoop instance only if one does not already exist.

Here is the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function will handle the make_current parameter correctly and the failing test should pass.
