## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance and ensure that it is the current IOLoop. It checks if the `make_current` parameter is provided and raises a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists. However, the current implementation is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly, as seen from the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the `initialize` function's logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. It is failing to correctly check if the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function logic needs to be updated to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and ensure that it only makes the current IOLoop if it does not already exist.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` remains unchanged when `make_current` is `None`.
- When `make_current` is `True`, the condition `if IOLoop.current() is not None` is added to check if the current IOLoop already exists. If it does, then raise a `RuntimeError`.
- The corrected version ensures that the current IOLoop is correctly handled based on the `make_current` parameter.
