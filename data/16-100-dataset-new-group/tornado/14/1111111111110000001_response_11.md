The cause of the bug is the logic used in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` function takes an optional argument `make_current`, which is then used to determine whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance or not. The faulty logic lies in the conditional checks for `make_current`. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, the code should raise a `RuntimeError` as indicated by the failing test, but the logic in the `initialize` function allows the second make_current=True construction to succeed without raising the `RuntimeError`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional checks for `make_current` in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
           raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With these modifications, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now correctly raise a `RuntimeError` when it tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

This will result in the fixing of the bug and the passing of the failing test.
