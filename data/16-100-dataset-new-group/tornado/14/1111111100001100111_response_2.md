1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. It checks the current instance of `IOLoop` and raises an error if it already exists when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`. The related functions `current` and `make_current` are used to manage the current instance of `IOLoop`.

2. The potential error location is in the `initialize` function where it checks the current instance of `IOLoop` and makes it current if necessary, based on the `make_current` argument.

3. The cause of the bug is that when the `make_current` argument is `True`, it checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, which does not match the intended logic. This results in the incorrect behavior of raising a RuntimeError when it should not.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the current instance of `IOLoop`.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we check if the current instance of `IOLoop` exists or not based on the logic of the `make_current` argument and then handle it accordingly. This will fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
