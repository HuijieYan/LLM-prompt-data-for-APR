The bug lies in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. This method is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. The error message indicates that when a new `IOLoop` is being initialized with `make_current=True`, an error is raised because the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking if an `IOLoop` already exists is incorrect. The conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is supposed to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, but it is instead checking if there is no instance. This logic is inverted, causing the error to be raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for `make_current` needs to be updated to correctly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We should first check if `make_current` is `True` and then check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and raise an error if it does.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that when `make_current=True`, it correctly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises an error if it does. Otherwise, it sets the current instance appropriately based on the value of `make_current`.
