The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it incorrectly handles the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make itself the current instance.

The issue arises from the fact that the function checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance but does not handle the case where the instance actually exists and should not be overridden. This leads to a RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None: 
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function now correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and should pass the failing test while resolving the GitHub issue.
