The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance and optionally make it the current IOLoop. However, the bug is in the conditional logic within the function, which does not handle the case where `make_current=True` correctly. 

The problem lies in the logic within the `initialize` method. When `make_current=True`, it is supposed to raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop already exists. However, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect. 

A strategy to fix this bug would be to use a proper conditional check for the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is True and the current instance of IOLoop is not None, then a `RuntimeError` should be raised. 

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (Other definitions here)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This change modifies the conditional logic under the `elif make_current` block to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` is provided as an argument, ensuring that it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop already exists.
