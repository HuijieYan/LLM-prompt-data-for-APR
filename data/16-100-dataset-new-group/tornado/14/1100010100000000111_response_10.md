The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists and, if not, make it the current instance. However, there is an issue when the `make_current` argument is set to `None` or `True`. This causes confusion and leads to an incorrect error message being raised.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is set to `None`.
2. The error message "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised incorrectly.

The bug is caused because when `make_current` is set to `None`, it enters both the `if` and the `elif` conditions and may wrongly attempt to make the current IOLoop, causing the error message to be raised even when it shouldn't.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditions and error handling as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current IOLoop instance in a variable `current_instance`. Then, based on the value of `make_current`, we check if the IOLoop already exists and make it the current instance if it doesn't. If `make_current` is set to `True`, we ensure that the IOLoop does not already exist before making it the current instance. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
