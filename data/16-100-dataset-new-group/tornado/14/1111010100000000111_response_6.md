### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is checking the current instance of `IOLoop` using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method. If the `make_current` argument is not provided, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and if not, it sets the current instance to itself. If the `make_current` argument is `True`, it also checks for a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if one already exists.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditional checks for the current `IOLoop` instance and setting the current instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` are redundant and may lead to confusion, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the conditional checks for the current `IOLoop` instance can be simplified, and the logic for setting the current instance can be streamlined.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for setting the current instance of `IOLoop` is simplified. If `make_current` is `True`, it directly checks for the current instance and raises an error if it exists. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if there is no current instance before setting the current instance. This resolves the redundancy and potential confusion in the original logic.
