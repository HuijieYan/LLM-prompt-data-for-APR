### Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is already created. It raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create two current instances with `make_current=True` and expects the second one to raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, specifically at the conditional check that raises the `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The conditional logic in the `initialize` function to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists is not handled correctly. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks for the existence of a current instance, but in this case, it should allow creating a new instance and only raise an error if there is already a current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the `initialize` function should be modified to allow creating a new current instance if `make_current=True` and only raise an error if there is already a current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the second condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is replaced with `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`. This change ensures that a new current instance can be created if there is no current instance, and it raises a `RuntimeError` only if there is already a current instance.
