The buggy function `initialize` in the file `tornado/ioloop.py` has an issue related to the `IOLoop.current` method. The function checks whether a current IOLoop instance exists and if not, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, there is a logical error in the condition that checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None or not.

The cause of the bug is that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This is contradictory to the intended logic, as the error should only be raised when a current IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug, the condition for raising the `RuntimeError` should be modified to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, rather than if it is None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the function should now properly check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and raise an error only when it already exists, as intended. This will address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
