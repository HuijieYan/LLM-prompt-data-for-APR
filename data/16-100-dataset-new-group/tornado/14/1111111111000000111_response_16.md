The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` and set it as the current `IOLoop` if the `make_current` argument is set to true. However, the bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to false, where it incorrectly checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` and raises a `RuntimeError` even if one does not exist.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and if it is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` even if `make_current` is set to false. This behavior is inconsistent with the intended functionality of the `make_current` argument.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to only attempt to make the `IOLoop` current if the `make_current` argument is set to true. If it is set to false, the `initialize` function should simply initialize the `IOLoop` without checking for the existence of a current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that the `IOLoop` is initialized based on the argument's value.

This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test `test_force_current` to pass.
