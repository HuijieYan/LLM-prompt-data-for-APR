The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing an incorrect behavior when `make_current` is set to `True`. The bug is preventing the function from correctly checking whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists and making it the current instance. This is leading to the incorrect behavior and the RuntimeError being raised.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and the logic for setting it as the current instance.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks within the `initialize` function are not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. The conditional statements are not properly checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, a more robust conditional check should be implemented to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. Additionally, the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance should be reviewed to ensure it works as intended.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and current_instance is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first store the value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the variable `current_instance` to avoid calling the method multiple times. Then, we use this variable in the conditional checks to correctly handle the scenarios when `make_current` is `None` or `True`. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
