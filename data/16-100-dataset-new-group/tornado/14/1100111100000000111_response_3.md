The issue here is that the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is not behaving as expected. The problem arises from the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` which is not being evaluated properly. 

The cause of the bug is that the condition is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists or not, and based on that, either create a new instance or raise an error. However, the condition is not working as intended, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `initialize` function to properly check if the current IOLoop instance exists or not, and handle the logic accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.__class__.current(instance=False) is None:  # Fixed line
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.__class__.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed line
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we are explicitly referencing the `self.__class__.current` function to ensure that it is being called from the correct class. We also adjusted the conditions to properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

With these modifications, the `initialize` function should now behave as expected and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
