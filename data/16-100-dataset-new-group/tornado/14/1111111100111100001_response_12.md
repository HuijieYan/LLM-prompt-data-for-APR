The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize an `IOLoop` instance and make it the current `IOLoop` if the `make_current` parameter is specified as `True`. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when `make_current` is specified as `True`, suggesting that a current `IOLoop` already exists.

The issue seems to be with the logic for checking if a current `IOLoop` exists before making the new instance the current one. The logic in the `initialize` function does not seem to be correctly checking if a current `IOLoop` exists before performing the necessary actions.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking if a current `IOLoop` exists needs to be revised. The corrected version of the `initialize` function should first check if a current `IOLoop` exists before attempting to make the new instance the current one.

Here's a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected logic, the `initialize` function should properly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` and raise a `RuntimeError` if necessary, based on the `make_current` parameter.
