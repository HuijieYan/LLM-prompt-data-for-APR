The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly. When `make_current` is set to `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, it should raise the `RuntimeError` as it currently does. However, when `make_current` is set to `None`, it should check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then make the current instance if it is. 

The provided code does not handle the case when `make_current` is `None` correctly because it does not have a conditional check for this case.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be updated to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `elif make_current` condition is updated to `elif make_current is True` to explicitly check for `True` value. Additionally, the condition for checking if `IOLoop.current` is not `None` is updated to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to ensure that the correct condition is being checked. These changes address the issues identified and should resolve the bug.
