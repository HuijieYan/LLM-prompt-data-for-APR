## Analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, the GitHub issue

The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the `ioloop.py` file. This function checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and calls the `make_current` function if it doesn't exist. There are two related functions `current` and `make_current` which are called within the `initialize` function.

The GitHub issue indicates that there is a discrepancy in the logic at line 252 of `ioloop.py`. It questions why a "current IOLoop already exists" error is raised if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations within the buggy function are at the conditional statements where it checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and then calls `make_current` or raises an error.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function may not properly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The conditionals may not be correctly handling the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic correctly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. This may involve revisiting the conditional statements and the related functions `current` and `make_current` to ensure they are working as expected.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(self):
        # body of the function
    
    def make_current(self):
        # body of the function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
