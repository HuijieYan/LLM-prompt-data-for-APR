The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class is not handling the `make_current` argument correctly, which is causing the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" when the `make_current=True` argument is passed.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should check whether there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present before attempting to make the new `IOLoop` current.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is True and current_instance is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test.
