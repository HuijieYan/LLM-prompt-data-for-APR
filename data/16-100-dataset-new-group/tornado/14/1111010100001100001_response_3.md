The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. However, there are potential error locations within the function that may cause the bug:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` may not be evaluating as expected, leading to incorrect control flow.
2. The behavior when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance is not handled properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This can lead to unexpected control flow and erroneous behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. We can also ensure that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is evaluated correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we store the current `IOLoop` instance in the `current_instance` variable to avoid redundant calls to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. We then use this variable to properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
