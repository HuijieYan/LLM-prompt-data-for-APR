The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. It is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to True. If `make_current` is not provided, it should only make itself the current IOLoop if no current instance exists.

The buggy function fails the test `test_force_current` because it does not handle the case where a second `make_current=True` construction is attempted. The test creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance also with `make_current=True`. The second instance should raise a `RuntimeError` because a current IOLoop already exists, but it does not and the test fails.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` function needs to check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` is provided, and raise a `RuntimeError` if one already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This revised `initialize` function checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before making a new one current, which resolves the bug.
