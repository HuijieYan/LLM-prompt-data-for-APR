The issue with the buggy function is that it checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance with the `IOLoop.current` method, but it does so with the `instance=False` argument. This means that the function is checking for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance that is not the current one.

The expected behavior of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function is to force the creation of a new current `IOLoop` instance, and if one already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to update the condition in the `initialize` function to check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance without passing `instance=False` to the `IOLoop.current` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the `initialize` function will correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and handle the `make_current` parameter as expected. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
