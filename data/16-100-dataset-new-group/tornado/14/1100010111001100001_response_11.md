The cause of the bug is that the `make_current` parameter is not being properly handled in the `initialize` function. The function does not correctly check if an IOLoop current instance already exists before attempting to make it current. Additionally, the function does not properly raise a `RuntimeError` when a current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and properly raise a `RuntimeError` when necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function now properly checks if a current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to make it current, and it correctly raises a `RuntimeError` when a current IOLoop already exists.

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test.
