The bug in the `initialize` function is that the conditional statement is not being handled correctly. The method `initialize` takes an argument `make_current` and checks its value. However, in the case when `make_current` is `None`, it incorrectly tries to call `self.make_current()`, which raises an error.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement in the `initialize` function needs to be rewritten to handle the `make_current` argument appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self._handle_make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self._handle_make_current()
```

In this fixed version, we are calling the method `_handle_make_current()` instead of `self.make_current()` to handle the case of `make_current` being `None`. Additionally, we have updated the conditional statement for the `elif` block to correctly check for the current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if it already exists.
