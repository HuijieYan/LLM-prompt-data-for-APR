## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

## Explanation:
The bug in the initialize function is that it does not properly handle the case when make_current is True. The buggy code will raise a RuntimeError when make_current is True, but it should actually raise the error when make_current is False and the current IOLoop already exists. The buggy function does not correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance, leading to the failing test.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should check if make_current is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists, and raise a RuntimeError accordingly.

## The corrected version of the function uses the correct checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance:
- If make_current is None, it checks if the current IOLoop instance does not exist, then it calls self.make_current().
- If make_current is True, it checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists, then it raises a RuntimeError.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
