## Corrections to the buggy function

The issue here is that the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The method is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance and set it as the current instance if `make_current` is true, but it is not doing so properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that the current IOLoop instance is properly set.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=False):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` method, the `make_current` parameter is properly handled. If `make_current` is true, it checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists and raises an error if it does. Otherwise, it sets the current IOLoop instance. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post and make the failing test pass.
