The buggy function is the `initialize` method inside the `IOLoop` class. This method is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current `IOLoop` unless there is already an instance present. However, it is incorrectly throwing a `RuntimeError` when trying to make the current `IOLoop` without checking if there is already an instance.

The failing test case `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then it asserts that the current `IOLoop` is equal to the one created. After that, it attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised because the first `IOLoop` instance is already the current loop.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method for `IOLoop` fails to handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when the `make_current` argument is `True`. This is the reason for the `RuntimeError` being raised during the second attempt to make the created `IOLoop` instance the current one.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to first check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. If there is an instance, raise a `RuntimeError`; otherwise, make the current instance the created one.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` method, the failing test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
