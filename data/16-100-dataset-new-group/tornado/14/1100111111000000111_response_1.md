## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is likely causing the issue.
2. The logic of the if-else block within the `initialize` function might be incorrect. 

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the logic inside the `initialize` function. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checking if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, in the failing test, when `make_current=True` is passed, it raises a `RuntimeError` which is conflicting with the condition.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be revised to ensure that the `make_current` parameter is handled correctly. The conditions need to be modified to check for the current IOLoop instance and handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```
After making these changes, the fixed `initialize` function should handle the `make_current` parameter correctly, and it should pass the failing test.
