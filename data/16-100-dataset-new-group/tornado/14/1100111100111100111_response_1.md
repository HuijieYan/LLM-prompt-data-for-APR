## Here's the corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By using `self.current` instead of `IOLoop.current`, we ensure that we are working with the current instance of the class. This resolves the issue of the function not behaving as expected and should pass the failing test mentioned in the GitHub issue.
