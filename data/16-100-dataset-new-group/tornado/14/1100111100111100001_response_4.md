The buggy function `initialize` has a condition that checks if `make_current` is True, and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, then it raises a RuntimeError.

The bug occurs in the condition `if make_current:` because it's checking the value of `make_current` directly for truthiness, but it should check if `make_current` is not None instead. This results in the RuntimeError being raised when `make_current` is True.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to `if make_current is not None:`

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other functions remain the same

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is not None:  # Fix the condition here
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this change, the condition `if make_current is not None:` will now correctly check if `make_current` is not None, preventing the RuntimeError from being raised when it's True.
