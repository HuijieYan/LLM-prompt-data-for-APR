The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop with the option to make it the current IOLoop. However, the bug causes it to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is `True`. This behavior is not consistent with the intended functionality, as the "already exists" error should only occur when a current IOLoop already exists and `make_current` is `None`.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error lies in the `initialize` function's conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and whether a current IOLoop exists.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks in the `initialize` function are not handling the `make_current` argument correctly. When `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` without checking if a current IOLoop already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be updated to properly handle the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is `True`, it should first check if a current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, the function should raise a `RuntimeError`. If not, it should proceed to make the IOLoop current.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ... 

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In this corrected version, the function first retrieves the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Based on the value of `make_current`, it checks whether a current instance exists and handles the error condition accordingly. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
