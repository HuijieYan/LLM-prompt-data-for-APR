The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logical bug causing the test to fail. The bug occurs in the condition `if make_current is None`. When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current IOLoop is `None` using the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it is `None`, then it calls `self.make_current()`. 

The error message indicates that the problem lies in the `if make_current is None` condition, as it is incorrectly checking for the presence of an existing IOLoop even when `make_current` is set to `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the logic inside the `if make_current is None` condition only checks for an existing IOLoop if `make_current` is `True`. If `make_current` is `None`, it should assume that a new IOLoop needs to be created and make it the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the changes as suggested, the corrected function will pass the failing test and handle the logic more appropriately.
