The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` fails the test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` and raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". 

The potential error in the function is in the condition `if make_current` where if `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does.

The cause of the bug is that the initial assignment of `self.io_loop` in the failing test, `test_force_current`, sets `make_current` to `True`. Then, when the second attempt is made to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True`, the buggy function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` because it thinks the current IOLoop already exists.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the condition `if make_current` in the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop already exists, and only attempt to make the current IOLoop if it does not exist. Then remove the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` and always call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version checks first if the current IOLoop exists, and if not, it makes the current IOLoop. There is no need to raise a `RuntimeError` since making the current IOLoop will not cause any issues. This modified version should pass the failing test.
