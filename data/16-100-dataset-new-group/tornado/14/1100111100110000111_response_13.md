### Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, and an issue has been reported on GitHub where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`, but the code is still raising a "current IOLoop already exists" error.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations are the conditions where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for `None` and subsequently raising the `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` (as reported in the GitHub issue), the code should not continue to raise a "current IOLoop already exists" error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by updating the condition where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for `None` and adding a check for not `None` before raising the `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other methods remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for not None condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By adding the `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` condition, the corrected version ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
