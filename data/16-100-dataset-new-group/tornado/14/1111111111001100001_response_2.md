The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current `IOLoop` if necessary. However, the logic for checking and setting the current instance seems to be flawed, causing the failing test `test_force_current` to fail.

The `initialize` function takes an input parameter `make_current` which, if `True`, should make the new `IOLoop` instance the current instance, and if `False`, should not try to become the current instance.

However, the logic inside the `initialize` function is not correctly checking and setting the current instance.

The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function's conditional branches. When `make_current` is `True`, the current instance should already exist, and it should raise an error if a current instance exists. If `make_current` is `False`, the new `IOLoop` should not try to become the current instance.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the current instance.

Here's a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass.
