## The buggy function analysis
The buggy function is the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. This method is responsible for initializing the IOLoop and possibly making it the current IOLoop. It relies on the `make_current` parameter to determine whether to make the IOLoop current. It also calls the `current` and `make_current` methods in the same class to accomplish this.

The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, the code tries to check if the current IOLoop is `None` and then raise a RuntimeError if it is. However, this check seems to be incorrect based on the error message and the GitHub issue.

## Potential error locations
1. Incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter when it is `True`.
2. Incorrect usage of the `current` method to check if the IOLoop is already current.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect logic in the conditional statement for `make_current`. It tries to check if the current IOLoop is `None` and then raises an error if it is, but this logic is flawed based on the error message and the GitHub issue. 

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check the logic for the `make_current` parameter and how it interacts with the `current` method.
2. Ensure that the correct condition is used to determine if the IOLoop is already current when `make_current` is `True`.
3. Validate the behavior of the `current` and `make_current` methods to ensure they are used correctly.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:  # Changed the condition here
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:  # Fixed the condition to check if IOLoop is not None
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the function now correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and accurately checks if the IOLoop is already current before making it so. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
