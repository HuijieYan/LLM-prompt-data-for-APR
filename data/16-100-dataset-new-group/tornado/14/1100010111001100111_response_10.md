### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` in `ioloop.py` is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance, and it includes a condition to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists. However, based on the failing test `test_force_current` in `ioloop_test.py`, it seems that the condition is not working correctly, as it is raising a `RuntimeError` when the current IOLoop instance exists.

The issue posted on GitHub also highlights the same problem, questioning why the RuntimeError is being raised if the IOLoop.current instance is None.

### Bug Location
The potential error location in the buggy function could be in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, as it seems to be incorrectly checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect evaluation of the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists or not, but it is not working as intended based on the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance needs to be revised. It seems that the condition is not correctly evaluating the existing IOLoop instance, which is leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised. The condition should be modified to accurately determine if the IOLoop instance exists or not.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
