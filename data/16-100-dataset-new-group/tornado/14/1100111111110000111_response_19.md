The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a bug where it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when the `IOLoop.current` instance is `None`. This is causing the failing test `test_force_current` to not pass and leads to the RuntimeError message "current IOLoop already exists".

The cause of the bug is that the conditional check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is always evaluated as `False`, leading to the incorrect raising of the `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` needs to be revised so that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if the `IOLoop.current` instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the buggy function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
