The issue in the `initialize` function is that it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance, but the logic to handle this check is incorrect. The issue on GitHub points out that the function is raising an error for an IOLoop instance being None, even though it should not be. 

The potential error locations are:
1. The conditional check for `make_current` being None or not.
2. The conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks are not correctly handling the case when the current IOLoop instance is None, resulting in the incorrect error being raised.

To fix the bug, we can:
- Modify the conditional checks to properly handle the case when the current IOLoop instance is None.
- Update the logic to ensure that the error is only raised when the IOLoop instance is already present and `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if not current_instance:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case when the current IOLoop instance is None and only raise the error when it already exists and `make_current` is True.
