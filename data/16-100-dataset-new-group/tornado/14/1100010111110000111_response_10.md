The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is responsible for initializing the IOLoop object and setting it as the current IOLoop. However, the bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the `make_current` parameter, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised when it shouldn't.

The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` attempts to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then checks if the current IOLoop is indeed the one that was created. It also verifies that attempting to create a second IOLoop with `make_current=True` should fail with a `RuntimeError`.

The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised even though the current IOLoop is `None`, which is causing confusion.

The GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" highlights the confusion about why the `RuntimeError` is being raised when the current IOLoop is `None` at line 252.

To fix the bug, the function `initialize` needs to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop is `None`. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already an existing current IOLoop.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already an existing current IOLoop when `make_current=True`.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
