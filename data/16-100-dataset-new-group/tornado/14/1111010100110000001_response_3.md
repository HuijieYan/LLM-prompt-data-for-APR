### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is causing a `RuntimeError` when it tries to set the current `IOLoop`. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` already exists and it should not be overridden.

### Identified Error Locations
The potential error locations in the `initialize` function are:
1. The conditional statement allowing `make_current` to override the current `IOLoop`.
2. The `self.make_current()` call when `make_current` is not `None` and no new `IOLoop` should be set as the current one.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the function allowing an override of the current `IOLoop` even when it's not expected. This results in a `RuntimeError` being raised when it tries to set an existing `IOLoop` as the current one, which is not desired.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to only set the current `IOLoop` if it is not already set, and to raise an error when trying to override the current `IOLoop` when it should not be allowed.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is `True`, and if so, we raise an error if the current `IOLoop` already exists. Then, if `make_current` is `None` and there is no current `IOLoop`, we set the current instance. This ensures that the current `IOLoop` is only set if it is not already set, and it prevents overriding when not desired.
