The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is causing a bug. The `initialize` function contains conditional logic to check if an IOLoop instance is already current and should become current.

The buggy function seems to be incorrectly handling the case when `make_current=True`. It incorrectly detects that an IOLoop instance already exists even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, leading to the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error. This issue has been identified and reported in the GitHub issue titled `ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None`.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic of the `initialize` function should be corrected to properly handle the case when `make_current=True`. The logic should ensure that a new IOLoop can only become current if no IOLoop instance currently exists, and it should raise an error otherwise.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the corrected `initialize` function, the conditional logic for handling `make_current=True` is adjusted to properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to make the new instance as the current one. This change should resolve the reported bug and make the failing test pass.
