The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. The function checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`, and if not, it makes the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if there is currently no instance of `IOLoop`. The use of `instance=False` could be causing an issue.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter may not be fully addressing all cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function may not be correctly handling the `make_current` parameter, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to initialize the `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to:
1. Modify the condition for checking the current instance of `IOLoop` to ensure it accurately determines if there is no current instance.
2. Adjust the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter to correctly set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the parameter value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current()
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
