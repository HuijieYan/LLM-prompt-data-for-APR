The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. It should check if an IOLoop already exists before creating a new one.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. It should first check if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if so, raise a `RuntimeError` to indicate that a current IOLoop already exists. If no IOLoop instance exists, then it should create a new one.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test should now pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
