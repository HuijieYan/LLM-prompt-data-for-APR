### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if there is a current IOLoop and make it the current one if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the current implementation is raising a `RuntimeError` even when the current IOLoop is not already existing.

The error message and the GitHub issue indicate that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the condition when `make_current` is `True`. The function should only raise a `RuntimeError` when a current IOLoop already exists, but the current implementation is not handling this condition properly.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check when `make_current` is `True` to properly handle the case when a current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make it the current one.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the function will only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop already exists. Otherwise, it will proceed to make the IOLoop the current one. This fix should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
