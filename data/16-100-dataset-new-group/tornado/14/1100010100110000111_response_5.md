## Analysis:
The bug is located in the `initialize` function of the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when the `make_current` flag is set to `True`, even though the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the conditional statement for `make_current`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional check for the `make_current` flag. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement for `make_current` to correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this corrected version, the function checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance before deciding whether to make the current instance or raise a `RuntimeError`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and the failing test.
