## Explanation

The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The purpose of this method is to initialize the IOLoop, and if `make_current` is True, it should make the IOLoop the current IOLoop instance. However, due to the bug, even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, it raises a `RuntimeError` saying "current IOLoop already exists".

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not is incorrect. The logic should be reversed: if the current IOLoop is None and we are trying to make it the current IOLoop, it should do so, not raise an error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True and there is no current IOLoop instance. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, it should make the IOLoop the current instance.

## The corrected version of the code

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance has been corrected. If `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop is None, it will make the IOLoop the current instance. If `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop is not None, it will raise a `RuntimeError` as before.
