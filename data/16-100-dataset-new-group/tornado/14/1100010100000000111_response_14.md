Analysis:
The buggy function "initialize" checks if "make_current" is None, and if so, checks if "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" is None. If it is, then it calls "self.make_current()". If "make_current" is not None, it checks if "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" is None, and if it is, it raises a RuntimeError. 

Potential Error Locations:
The potential error in the buggy function is the conditional check for "IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None", and the subsequent logic based on this condition.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect use of conditional logic. The function incorrectly raises a RuntimeError when "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" is None, which is contradictory to the condition.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional logic and the subsequent actions based on the condition.

Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the value of "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" in a variable "current_instance" to avoid calling the function multiple times. Then we use this variable in the conditional checks and subsequent actions. This ensures that the actions are based on the correct condition and should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
