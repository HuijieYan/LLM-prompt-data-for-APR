The bug in the function `initialize` of the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py` is causing the test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` to fail. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, causing the subsequent `if` statement to fail and raise a `RuntimeError`.

The probable cause of the bug is that the `if` statement in the `initialize` function is incorrectly checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. This leads to the function incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when it should not.

To fix this bug, the conditional statements in the `initialize` function should be revised to handle the `make_current` argument appropriately and prevent the incorrect RuntimeError from being raised.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        # Check if the current IOLoop instance is already present
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            # If not present, make the current IOLoop instance
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            # If current IOLoop already exists, raise RuntimeError
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        # If current IOLoop does not yet exist, make the current IOLoop instance
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the `initialize` function will handle the `make_current` argument correctly, preventing the incorrect `RuntimeError` from being raised.

Once updated, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
