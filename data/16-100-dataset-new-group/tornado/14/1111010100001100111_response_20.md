The buggy function `initialize` is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop class, making it the current IOLoop instance if `make_current` is True. However, the bug occurs when the function incorrectly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance, leading to a RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

The cause of the bug is that the condition checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance is incorrect. The code checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError. However, the intention is to check if the current instance already exists and only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True.

To fix the bug, the condition should be inverted and the check for the existence of the current instance should be done differently.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None in the case where `make_current` is None, and only makes the current instance if it does not exist. In the case where `make_current` is True, it checks if the current instance exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does. This correction ensures that the behavior aligns with the intended logic and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
