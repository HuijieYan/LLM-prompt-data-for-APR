The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is causing the failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` to raise a `RuntimeError`. The failing test is attempting to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but it incorrectly raises the `RuntimeError` even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

The issue arises from the conditional checks in the `initialize` function, specifically in the `elif make_current` block, where it is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional checks in the `initialize` function, where it's not handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` properly.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks in the `initialize` function are not handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` properly. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks in the `initialize` function need to be adjusted to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, the `make_current` function should be called in this case.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, fixing the issue reported in GitHub and allowing the failing test to pass.
