## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance by setting it as the current `IOLoop` if it doesn't already exist. However, there are issues with the conditional checks and the logic to handle the `make_current` parameter.

The GitHub issue mentions that on line 252, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` evaluates to `None`, but the function still raises a "current IOLoop already exists" error. This indicates that the logic within the function is not properly handling the case where the `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should only set the current `IOLoop` if it doesn't already exist. However, the current logic doesn't properly handle this condition.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by updating the conditional checks to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the `IOLoop` already exists.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
1. We first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the `current_instance` variable to avoid calling the method multiple times.
2. We then update the conditional checks to properly handle the cases when `make_current` is `None` or `True`.
3. If `make_current` is `None`, we check if the `current_instance` is `None` and then call `self.make_current()` if it is.
4. If `make_current` is `True`, we check if the `current_instance` is not `None` and raise a `RuntimeError` if it is, otherwise we call `self.make_current()`.

This corrected version addresses the bug by properly handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and the `IOLoop` already exists.
