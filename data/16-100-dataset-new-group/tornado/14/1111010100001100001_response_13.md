The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance, unless there is already a current instance, in which case it raises a `RuntimeError`. 

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. The `if make_current is None` condition does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True`.
2. The `elif make_current` condition does not handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
3. There is a missing definition for `self.make_current()`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True`, and does not properly call `self.make_current()`. This results in the function not setting the current `IOLoop` instance when it should.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case where `make_current` is `True`, and properly call `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # added "is" comparison
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # inverted the condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()  # called make_current method
```
In the corrected version, the function now properly handles the case where `make_current` is `True` and calls `self.make_current()` to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
