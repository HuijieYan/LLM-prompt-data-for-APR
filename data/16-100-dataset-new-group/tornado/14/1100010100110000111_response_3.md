## Fixing the bug in the initialize function

### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the "current IOLoop already exists" error is being raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`.
2. The GitHub issue also points out the discrepancy between the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the subsequent error message.
3. It seems that the `if` condition is not behaving as expected.

### Potential error location:
The potential error is in the `if` condition where it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug might be caused by the incorrect evaluation of the `if` condition, leading to the erroneous raising of the "current IOLoop already exists" error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to review the logic of the `initialize` function and modify the condition that checks for the existence of the current IOLoop. It may require re-evaluating the usage of the `make_current` parameter to ensure that the IOLoop is correctly initialized.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    # Check if make_current is None or False
    if make_current in (None, False):
        # Only make the IOLoop current if it doesn't exist
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # If make_current is True
        # If the IOLoop already exists, raise an error
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        # Otherwise, make the IOLoop current
        self.make_current()
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is `None` or `False`. If so, we only make the IOLoop current if it doesn't already exist. If `make_current` is `True`, we check if the IOLoop already exists and raise an error if it does. Otherwise, we make the IOLoop current.

This approach ensures that the IOLoop is initialized correctly based on the `make_current` parameter and the current state of the IOLoop, addressing the issue and passing the failing test.
