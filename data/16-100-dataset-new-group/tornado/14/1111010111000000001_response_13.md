The buggy function "initialize" in the class "IOLoop" is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance, including the logic for making it the current IOLoop. The bug seems to be related to the logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop instance based on the value of the "make_current" parameter.

The bug in the initialize function is causing the failing test "test_force_current" to fail. The failing test is trying to create a new IOLoop instance with "make_current" set to True, and then it checks if the current IOLoop is the same as the newly created one. It then tries to create another IOLoop instance with "make_current" set to True, and it expects this to fail with a `RuntimeError`. However, this does not happen because of the bug in the initialize function.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic within the initialize function to correctly handle the setting of the current IOLoop instance based on the value of the "make_current" parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the "initialize" function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the failing test "test_force_current" should pass as expected.
