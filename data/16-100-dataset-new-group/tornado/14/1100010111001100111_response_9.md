The bug in the `initialize` function is that the condition `if make_current is None:` is not being handled correctly. This is causing the test case `test_force_current` to fail. The condition `if make_current is None:` should be checked first, and then the subsequent conditions should be nested within it.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the first `if` condition fails, and it directly goes to the `elif` condition, causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly, which contradicts the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to properly handle the `make_current` parameter by adding a nested `if` condition to check if `make_current` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By adding the nested `if` condition to properly check the `make_current` parameter, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
