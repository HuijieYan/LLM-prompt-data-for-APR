## Corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

## Analysis of the buggy function

The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current IOLoop instance. However, it has several potential error locations:
1. The `if make_current is None:` condition seems to be unnecessary as it does not properly check for the None value of `make_current`.
2. The `elif make_current:` condition does not handle the case when `make_current` is False.

## Cause of the bug
The buggy function does not correctly handle the cases when `make_current` is None or when `make_current` is False.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we can simplify the code by removing the unnecessary conditions and properly handle the cases when `make_current` is True or False.

The corrected version of the function above addresses the potential error locations and properly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance based on the value of `make_current`.
