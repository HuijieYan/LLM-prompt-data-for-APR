The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class of `tornado/ioloop.py`. This method is meant to initialize the IOLoop, and if `make_current` is True, it should make the IOLoop the current IOLoop.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the conditionals for checking the value of `make_current` and the subsequent logic to handle the current state of the IOLoop.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic in the `initialize` method does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError` in this case, it should be checking if the current IOLoop instance is None, and then proceed to make the IOLoop the current one.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the conditional logic inside the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Given the analysis, a corrected version of the `initialize` method is provided below:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` method checks the value of `make_current` and the current instance of the IOLoop, and then proceeds to either make the IOLoop the current one or raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is True.
