The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop, but it has a bug where it incorrectly checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and raises a RuntimeError when `make_current` is set to True. This bug is causing the failing test `test_force_current` to fail with the error message "RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists".

The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are in the conditional statements where it checks the current IOLoop instance and decides whether to make it current or raise an error.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements within the `initialize` function are incorrectly checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and raising an error when it shouldn't. This is causing the RuntimeError to be raised when `make_current` is set to True, even if the current IOLoop instance is None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to True and there is no current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other methods and functions ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current or (make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None):
            self.make_current()
```

Using the corrected version of the `initialize` function should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass without raising a RuntimeError. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue related to this bug.
