## Correction

The issue is in the `initialize` method where the condition `if make_current is None` is not properly handling the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current is None` and the subsequent check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` are not properly handling the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None` even though it should not be None.

To fix this bug, we need to refactor the logic in the `initialize` method to properly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By using `if IOLoop.current(instance=False):` instead of `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` we are properly checking whether the current IOLoop exists and making the instance accordingly.

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the failing test passes.
