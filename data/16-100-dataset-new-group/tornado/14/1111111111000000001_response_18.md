The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current IOLoop instance if it's not already set, based on the `make_current` argument. However, the bug occurs because the logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop is incorrect.

The bug occurs in the `initialize` function where the logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop instance is incorrect. The issue is with the `if` conditions. When `make_current` is `None`, the function checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` and then attempts to make the current instance. However, if `make_current` is `True`, it also checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, which is incorrect. Additionally, it does not handle the case where `make_current` is `False`.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and set the current IOLoop instance accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current == True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current == False:
        pass  # Do nothing
```

The correction involves checking for `make_current` value explicitly and handling each case accordingly. If `make_current` is `False`, it does nothing and leaves the current IOLoop instance as is. If `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is `None` and the current instance does not exist, it makes the current instance.
