The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" to be raised incorrectly. The issue is related to the `make_current` parameter handling.

The problem is that the logic in the `initialize` function is not correctly considering the case when `make_current` is `True`. It should only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

In the provided failing test, the input parameter `make_current` is `True` and it triggers the incorrect RuntimeError.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function should be updated to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Fixed version of the buggy function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # removed the elif condition and simplified the logic here
            if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the fixed version, the condition `elif make_current:` is removed, and the logic inside the `else` block is updated to check if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, so that it correctly raises a RuntimeError in that case.

With this fix, the provided failing test should now pass without raising a RuntimeError.
