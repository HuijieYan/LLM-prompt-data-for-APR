The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance by calling the `current` method of the `IOLoop` class. However, the `current` method being called is the class method, not the instance method. This is likely leading to incorrect checks for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `current` method being called is the instance method, not the class method. We can do this by referencing the `self` parameter within the `initialize` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # Call the instance method using self
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # Call the instance method using self
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By calling the `current` method using `self` within the `initialize` method, we ensure that the correct method is being called to check for the existence of the `IOLoop` instance. This should fix the bug and improve the functionality of the `initialize` method.
