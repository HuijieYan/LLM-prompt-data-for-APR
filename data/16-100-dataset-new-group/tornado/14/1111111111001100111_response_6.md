The bug in the `initialize` function is caused by the incorrect checking logic for the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise an error if it does. However, the current implementation is raising the error even if no instance exists. 

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the conditions inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the existing `IOLoop` instances.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter, and it should pass the failing test case provided.
