Potential error locations:
1. The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` may not be evaluated correctly.
2. The condition `if make_current is None` may not be handling the logic as expected.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect evaluation of the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition is being checked within the `if` statement, which is conflicting with the logic for handling `make_current`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should review the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop and the `make_current` parameter. We also need to ensure that the conditions are properly nested and evaluated to handle all cases correctly.

Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
