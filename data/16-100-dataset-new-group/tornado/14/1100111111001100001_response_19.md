The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop by setting it as the current IOLoop. However, the bug causes the function to fail the test `test_force_current` because it does not handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

The buggy function first checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`. If it is, then it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to see if there is already a current IOLoop. If there isn't, it calls `self.make_current()` to set the IOLoop as the current one.

The bug occurs in the `elif` condition. If `make_current` is not `None` and evaluates to `True`, it checks again if there is already a current IOLoop. If there isn't, it raises a `RuntimeError` and then calls `self.make_current()`.

The bug here is that it should not call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop. Instead, it should only call `self.make_current()` if there is no current IOLoop.

To fix this bug, we should remove the unnecessary check in the `elif` condition and ensure that `self.make_current()` is only called when there is no current IOLoop.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In this corrected version, we handle the `make_current` parameter appropriately by only calling `self.make_current()` if there is no current IOLoop or if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`. If there is already a current IOLoop and `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` as expected.
