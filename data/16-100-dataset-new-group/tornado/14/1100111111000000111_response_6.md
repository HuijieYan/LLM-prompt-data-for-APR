The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is True. The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, but it is not checking for the existence of a current IOLoop before attempting to make the current IOLoop, resulting in the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True, and check if a current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make it the current one.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function now correctly checks for the existence of a current IOLoop before attempting to make it the current one, resolving the issue and allowing the failing test to pass.
