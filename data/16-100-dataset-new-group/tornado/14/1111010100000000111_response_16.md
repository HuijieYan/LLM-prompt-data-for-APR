The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is related to the handling of the `make_current` argument. The bug occurs when the `make_current` is set to `None` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is also `None`, but then the code still tries to make the IOLoop current and raises an error if it already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for handling the `make_current` argument is incorrect. When `make_current` is `None`, the code should only make the IOLoop current if there is no current instance. However, the current logic checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then still tries to make it current.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument needs to be adjusted. It should only make the IOLoop current if `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance, or if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
This corrected version of the `initialize` function checks the `make_current` argument and the current instance separately to ensure that the IOLoop is only made current when the conditions are appropriate.
