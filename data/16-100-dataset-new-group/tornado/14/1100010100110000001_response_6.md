### Analysis
The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is triggered because the "current IOLoop already exists." This suggests that there is a condition where the IOLoop instance is already created and the function is attempting to create it again.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely in the conditional statements within the `initialize` function. It is not handling the case where the IOLoop is already initialized properly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case where the IOLoop instance is already created. It only checks for the absence of the current instance before attempting to create a new one, but it does not handle the case where the instance already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the conditionals to properly handle the case where the IOLoop instance already exists. This can be done by checking if the IOLoop instance exists and then taking appropriate action based on that.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# this is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            pass  # IOLoop instance already exists, do nothing
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
