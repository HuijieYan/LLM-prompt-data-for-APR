The bug in the `initialize` function is that the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists is not properly handled. The logic is supposed to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, then either create a new one or raise an error if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling these conditions, leading to the test failure.

The key issue here is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is being checked twice, and the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is not correct.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be reworked based on the input parameter `make_current` and the current state of the `IOLoop` instance. The correct logic should ensure that if `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if it's `None`, it should check for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance and create one if needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should properly handle the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance based on the input parameter `make_current` and the current state of the `IOLoop`.
