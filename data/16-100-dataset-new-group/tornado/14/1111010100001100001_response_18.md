The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance, making it the current instance if `make_current` is `True`. However, the function has a bug that prevents it from correctly handling the `make_current` parameter.

The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. The function tries to check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`, but the logic is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and handle the case when a current instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first obtain the current instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then, we correctly handle the `make_current` parameter by checking if it is `None`, and if not, we check the condition for making the current instance.

This fixes the bug and ensures that the `initialize` function correctly initializes the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
