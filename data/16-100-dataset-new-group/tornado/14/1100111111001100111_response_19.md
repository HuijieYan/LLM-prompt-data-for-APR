## Correction

### Analysis
The issue in the `initialize` function seems to be with the conditional checks when `make_current` is provided as an input. It should only check for the existence of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` when `make_current` is `True`, and not raise an error if it is `None`. Additionally, the `make_current()` function should be called when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.

### Correction Strategy
1. Update the conditional checks to only raise an error when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`.
2. Call the `self.make_current()` function when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.

### Corrected Code
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other functions remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated the conditional check
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()  # Call make_current() if make_current is True and IOLoop.current() is None
```

By updating the conditional checks and calling `self.make_current()` appropriately, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
