The `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class has a bug that causes it to incorrectly handle the `make_current` argument. The purpose of the `initialize` function is to set the current IOLoop instance if one does not already exist, based on the value of the `make_current` argument. It should also raise an error if `make_current` is set to `True` but a current IOLoop instance already exists.

The bug is identified in the following lines of code:
```python
if make_current is None:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```
The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `None`, as it incorrectly checks for the absence of the current IOLoop instance and sets it using `self.make_current()` method.

The correct approach is to use the `make_current` argument to control whether the new `IOLoop` instance becomes the current one, as described in the class documentation.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
