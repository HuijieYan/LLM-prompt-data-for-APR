## Analysis
The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file has a bug that causes the `test_force_current` to fail. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, but it fails when `make_current` is set to `True`.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location is the conditional check for `make_current` and the subsequent logic inside each branch.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists. However, the current implementation incorrectly allows the second `make_current=True` construction, which should not be allowed. This leads to a failure in the `test_force_current` test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by properly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop when `make_current=True` and raising a `RuntimeError` if it already exists.

## Bug-fixed Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the bug-fixed version, the conditional check within the `initialize` function is modified to correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop when `make_current=True` and raise a `RuntimeError` if it already exists. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and cause the `test_force_current` to pass.
