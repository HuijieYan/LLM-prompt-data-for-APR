#### Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if it is not already set. However, there is a bug in the logic of the function. 

The `initialize` function takes an input parameter `make_current` which is supposed to control whether the new `IOLoop` should become the current instance. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and if not, then it sets the new `IOLoop` as the current one. If `make_current` is `True`, it is supposed to set the new `IOLoop` as the current instance if there is none already, and if there is an existing current instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function due to incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current=True`, the function does not correctly handle the case where there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance. It should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case, but the current logic does not do so.

### Fix:
We need to add a condition to check if there is already a current instance of the `IOLoop` when `make_current=True` and raise a `RuntimeError` in this case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
