The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is supposed to initialize an instance of the class with the option to make it the current IOLoop. It checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and makes the current IOLoop if not. If `make_current` is True, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if so, otherwise, it makes the current `IOLoop`.

The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised when `make_current` is True, even though this should not be the case.

### Bug
The bug in the code seems to be in the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. In the `initialize` function, the logic is incorrect when `make_current` is True. Instead of checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, the code incorrectly checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then raises an error.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter should be corrected. When `make_current` is True, the code should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if so, raise an error. If there is no current `IOLoop` instance, then it should make the current `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
