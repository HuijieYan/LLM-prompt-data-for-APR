The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing the RuntimeError to be raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning None. This is due to the incorrect checking of conditions in the `initialize` function.

The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter and the subsequent checks for the current instance of `IOLoop`.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the current instance of `IOLoop`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions as before

    def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `make_current` parameter is defaulting to `True`. Then, if `make_current` is True, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` exists, and if it does, it raises a RuntimeError. Otherwise, it proceeds to call `self.make_current()`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
