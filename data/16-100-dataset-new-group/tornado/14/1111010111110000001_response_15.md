## Analysis
The buggy function is the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The problem arises when `make_current` is set to `True` and it is trying to raise a `RuntimeError` because the current `IOLoop` already exists.

## Error Location
The error is located in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class when `make_current` is set to `True`.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method is not handling the case where `make_current` is set to `True` correctly. It incorrectly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, leading to the erroneous `RuntimeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by removing the check for a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. Instead, it should directly set the current `IOLoop` instance.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `make_current` argument is checked for `None` and `True`. If it is `None`, it defaults to `True` and tries to make the `IOLoop` instance current if it does not exist. If `make_current` is `True`, it directly sets the current `IOLoop` instance. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
