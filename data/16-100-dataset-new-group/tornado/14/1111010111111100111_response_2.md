### Corrections to the buggy function

The cause of the bug is that if make_current is None, it checks if the IOLoop.current() is None, and then calls self.make_current(), which results in the RuntimeError being raised in the failing test since the IOLoop is indeed not None, causing the conditional block to proceed even when make_current is None.

To fix the bug, we need to update the initialize function to handle the case when make_current is None separately from when it is True. If make_current is None, it should simply return without doing anything. The correct implementation would be as follows:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code)

    # Fixing the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            return  # Do nothing if make_current is None
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected implementation, the failing test test_force_current should pass as intended, and the issue reported on GitHub would be resolved.
