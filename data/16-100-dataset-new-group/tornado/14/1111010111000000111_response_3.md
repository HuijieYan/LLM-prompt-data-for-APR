The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the current `IOLoop` instance, but it has a bug that causes it to incorrectly check whether a current instance already exists. This bug is identified through the failing test `test_force_current` and is related to GitHub issue `ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None`, which questions the logic in line 252 of the `IOLoop` file.

The buggy function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, it only checks if the current instance is `None` and then tries to make the current instance, leading to an incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should first check for the existence of a current instance, and if it exists, then raise a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is `False`, it should skip trying to make the current instance. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, thus resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
