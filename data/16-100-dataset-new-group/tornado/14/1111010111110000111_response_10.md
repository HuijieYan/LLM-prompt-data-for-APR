The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance, and if `make_current` is specified, it should ensure that the current IOLoop does not already exist before making this instance the current IOLoop. However, when the `test_force_current` test is run, it fails with the error message "RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists".

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the `initialize` function can be attributed to the logic for checking whether the current `IOLoop` exists or not when `make_current` is specified.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case where `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` when `make_current=True` and handle this condition appropriately. We also need to potentially update the logic for setting the current `IOLoop`.

### Corrected version of the `initialize` function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is modified to explicitly check if `make_current` is not None first. Then, it checks if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` already exists to raise a `RuntimeError`. Lastly, it handles the case where the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should address the bug and allow the `test_force_current` test to pass successfully.

Once the corrected version is implemented, the test should run and pass without any `RuntimeError`.
