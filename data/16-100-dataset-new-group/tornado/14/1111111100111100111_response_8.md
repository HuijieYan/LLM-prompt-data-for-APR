The issue in the buggy function is caused by a logical error in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is `True`, the function is checking if the IOLoop is None, and if not, it raises a RuntimeError. This logic is inverted and causing the issue.

To fix this bug, the logical condition inside the `initialize` method needs to be reversed. Additionally, the `make_current` argument should be explicitly set to `False` when it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With these changes, the logical condition for checking the current IOLoop and raising a RuntimeError has been corrected, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue.
