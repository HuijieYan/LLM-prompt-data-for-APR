The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None using `instance=False`, but then raises an error "current IOLoop already exists". This is contradictory and causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `initialize` function to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None before proceeding with the logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
