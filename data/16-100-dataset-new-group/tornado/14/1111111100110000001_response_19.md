### Analysis
The buggy function is the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. This method is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance. The method takes an optional argument `make_current`, which is used to determine whether the new `IOLoop` should attempt to become the current instance and raises an error if there is already a current `IOLoop`.

The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised, stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, suggesting that the code incorrectly believes that a current `IOLoop` is already present.

### Bug Identification
The bug is caused by a logic issue in the way the `make_current` argument is handled. It incorrectly raises an error if the `make_current` argument is `True`, even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument should be adjusted to only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Code
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other methods and documentation)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:  # otherwise, make it current
            self.make_current()
```
