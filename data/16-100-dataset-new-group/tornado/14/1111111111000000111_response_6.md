There are several potential errors in the buggy function `initialize`:
1. The logic for checking whether the current `IOLoop` instance already exists or not seems flawed.
2. The handling of the `make_current` argument also seems to be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when an `IOLoop` instance is already current and the `make_current` argument is set to `True`.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly check for the current instance of `IOLoop` and handle the `make_current` argument appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first retrieve the current instance of `IOLoop` and then handle the `make_current` argument accordingly. If `make_current` is set to `True` and a current instance already exists, we raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we make the current instance.

With this correction, the test `test_force_current` should now pass as the bug has been fixed.
