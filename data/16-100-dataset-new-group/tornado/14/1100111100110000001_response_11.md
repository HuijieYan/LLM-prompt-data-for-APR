The `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class checks whether the current IOLoop instance exists, and if it does not exist, it calls the `make_current` method. However, there are some issues in the implementation of this logic, resulting in a RuntimeError when the test case is executed.

The potential error locations are:
1. The `IOLoop.current` method is called from both the `initialize` method and the `make_current` method, but the actual implementation of the `current` method is missing from the provided code. This might lead to discrepancies in the expected behavior.
2. In the `initialize` method, the condition `if make_current is None` should check if the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, not `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.

To fix the bug:
1. Create a proper implementation for the `IOLoop.current` method.
2. Update the `initialize` method's conditional statement from `if make_current is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Proper implementation for the current method
        # ...

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        # Use the IOLoop.current method with correct arguments
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            if make_current is None:
                self.make_current()
            elif make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```
