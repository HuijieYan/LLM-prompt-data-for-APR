The cause of the bug is that the "initialize" method of the class "IOLoop" is not handling the "make_current" argument correctly. The code logic checks if the current IOLoop already exists, but it is not handling the case where the IOLoop is already current. When make_current is True, but there is already a current IOLoop instance, the code should not raise an error.

In order to fix the bug, the "initialize" method needs to be modified to handle the "make_current" argument properly. It should first check if there is a current IOLoop instance, and if there is, it should not raise an error and simply ignore the "make_current" argument.

Here's the corrected version of the "initialize" method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

This fix checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and simply makes the IOLoop current if it doesn't. If there is already a current instance, it does not raise an error and ignores the "make_current" argument.

With this fix, the failing test should pass without raising a RuntimeError.
