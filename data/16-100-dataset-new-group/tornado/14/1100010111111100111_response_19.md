The bug in the `initialize` function is that it's not checking for the existing instance of the IOLoop before trying to create a new one with `make_current=True`. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to make it the current one. If it doesn't exist, then make it the current one. If it does exist and `make_current=True`, then raise the RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will first check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and then proceed accordingly with making it the current one or raising a RuntimeError if it already exists.

This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
