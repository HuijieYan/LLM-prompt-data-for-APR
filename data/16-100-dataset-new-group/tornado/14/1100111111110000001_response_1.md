The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, but it has a bug where it is not checking whether the IOLoop is already initialized when `make_current` argument is set to `True`. This results in the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

The bug is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The function should check if the IOLoop is already initialized before making it the current IOLoop.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class to properly handle the case when a new IOLoop is being created and `make_current` is set to `True`. If the IOLoop is already initialized, then a RuntimeError should be raised.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:  # If make_current is not specified
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:  # If make_current is True
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise an error if IOLoop is already initialized
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` method will properly check if the IOLoop is already initialized when `make_current` is set to `True`, and will raise a RuntimeError if that is the case.
