The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it incorrectly checks for the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. The function should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

The cause of the bug:
- In the `initialize` function, when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, it should make the current instance. But if it is not `None`, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".
- Based on the GitHub issue, there seems to be confusion about why the error is raised even when the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`.

To fix the bug:
- We need to modify the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Only raise error if current instance exists
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
