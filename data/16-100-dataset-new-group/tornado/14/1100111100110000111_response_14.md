Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be related to the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is being evaluated as `False` when it should be `True`.

The cause of the bug is related to the use of the `current` function in the `initialize` function. The `current` function is defined both as a standalone function and as a method within the `IOLoop` class. When the `initialize` function calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check for an existing current IOLoop, it mistakenly evaluates to `False` when it should be `True`, leading to the incorrect behavior and the `RuntimeError` being raised.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to ensure that the correct `current` function is called within the `initialize` function. This can be achieved by explicitly using the class method `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` instead of the standalone function `current(instance=False)`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions remain the same...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # Use the class method
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Use the class method and check for not None
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `initialize` function calls `self.current(instance=False)` to correctly check for an existing current IOLoop within the class, ensuring that the condition is evaluated as expected and the bug is fixed.
