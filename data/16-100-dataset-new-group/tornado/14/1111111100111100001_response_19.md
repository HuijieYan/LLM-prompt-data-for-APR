The bug seems to be occurring in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The purpose of this function is to initialize the IOLoop, with an optional parameter `make_current` which defaults to `None`.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists. However, the bug causes the function to incorrectly raise the `RuntimeError` even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where `make_current` is set to `True` and check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is, then raise the `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`, and only raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.

This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
