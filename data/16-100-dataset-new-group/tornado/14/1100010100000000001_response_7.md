## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition `make_current is None` is not being checked correctly.
2. The condition `elif make_current` does not have a corresponding else condition which can potentially lead to unexpected behavior.


## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function occurs due to incorrect conditional checks leading to unexpected behavior. The condition `make_current is None` is not being checked correctly, and there is no corresponding else condition for the condition `elif make_current`.


## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the condition `make_current is None` to handle the scenario properly.
2. Add an else condition for the `elif make_current` to handle the other case.


## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
