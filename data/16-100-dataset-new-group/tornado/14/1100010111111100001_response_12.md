The buggy function `initialize` is expected to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists, by raising a `RuntimeError`. However, the current implementation does not handle this case properly, resulting in a failure in the test function `test_force_current`.

The error message indicates that the `initialize` function is not properly handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists. We can achieve this by first checking if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`, and if so, raising a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected implementation, the `initialize` function should properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists, and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
