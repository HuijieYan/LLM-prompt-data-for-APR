Based on the GitHub issue and the provided code, the potential error locations within the buggy function are the condition checks and the way the `make_current` argument is handled.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is None, it should only call `self.make_current()` if there is no current `IOLoop`. However, the current implementation checks for the absence of a current `IOLoop` after calling `self.make_current()`, which can lead to the "already exists" error being raised even though `make_current` is None.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be updated to first check if there is no current `IOLoop` before making it the current `IOLoop`. The condition checks for `make_current` should also be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    # Adjusted condition check to avoid the unnecessary `RuntimeError`
    elif make_current is False:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    # Adjusted condition check to avoid the unnecessary `RuntimeError`
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the condition checks ensure that `make_current` is handled properly and that the `IOLoop` is made current only when necessary. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
