The buggy function has a conditional statement that checks for the existence of the current IOLoop and raises a RuntimeError if it already exists. However, the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop is incorrectly implemented, leading to the incorrect behavior and the reported GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug lies in the conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop. The function is erroneously using the class method `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` instead of the instance method `self.current(instance=False)`. This results in the incorrect evaluation of whether the current IOLoop already exists, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop should use `self.current(instance=False)` instead of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `self.current(instance=False)` method is used for checking the existence of the current IOLoop, and the condition for raising a RuntimeError is also corrected. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
