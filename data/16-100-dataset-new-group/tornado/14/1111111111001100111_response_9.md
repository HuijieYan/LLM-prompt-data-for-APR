## The Bug
The `initialize` function is intended to initialize the IOLoop, but it contains a bug that causes it to raise a `RuntimeError` even when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the conditional checks for the `make_current` argument are incorrect. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current IOLoop instance exists and then make it the current instance. However, the current implementation always tries to make the IOLoop current, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when the IOLoop instance already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is not specified, it should only make the IOLoop current if no current instance exists. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. If it exists, it should raise an error; otherwise, it should make the IOLoop current.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for the existence of the current IOLoop
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should properly handle the `make_current` argument and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
