Analysis:
The function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance with an option to make it the current IOLoop. The bug seems to be related to the logic of checking for the current IOLoop instance. The issue on GitHub suggests that there is a problem with the condition where `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and then raising "already exists".

Identified Error Location:
The potential error seems to be in the conditional checks for making the current IOLoop instance.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect conditional logic in the `initialize` function. The logic is meant to check if the current IOLoop is None and then either make it the current one or raise an error if it already exists. However, the current logic does not handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` but it still raises an error.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The conditional checks in the `initialize` function need to be modified to handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None appropriately, and also to handle the case where the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current IOLoop instance in a variable `current_instance` and then use it in the conditional checks. This ensures that the `initialize` function handles the cases where the current IOLoop instance is None or not None correctly.
