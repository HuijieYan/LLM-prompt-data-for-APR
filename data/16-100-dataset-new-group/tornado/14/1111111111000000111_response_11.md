The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the `test_force_current` test to fail. The `initialize` function sets the current IOLoop instance, but it has a bug causing it to raise a RuntimeError even when the current IOLoop instance is None.

The cause of the bug is in the `initialize` function. The logic for checking if the current IOLoop instance is None is incorrect, leading to the RuntimeError being raised when it shouldn't be.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raise the RuntimeError only when necessary.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version of the `initialize` function, the logic now correctly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and handles the make_current parameter accordingly.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `test_force_current` test pass.
