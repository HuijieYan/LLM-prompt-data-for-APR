### Analysis
The buggy function seems to be designed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if necessary. However, the conditional checks and logic seem to be incorrect, causing the failing test to fail.

### Identifying the Bug
The bug seems to be in the conditional checks for make_current and the handling of the current IOLoop instance. The logic for checking if the current IOLoop instance exists and making it current is flawed.

### Explanation of the Bug
In the failing test, when make_current is set to True, the buggy function is not handling the case where the current IOLoop already exists correctly. Instead of raising a RuntimeError when a second make_current=True construction is attempted, the function is not performing the necessary check and allowing the second instance to be created.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to re-evaluate the conditional checks and the logic for handling the current IOLoop instance. Specifically, we need to ensure that when make_current is True, we check if the current IOLoop instance already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. Additionally, we need to ensure that the self.make_current() method is being called correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
