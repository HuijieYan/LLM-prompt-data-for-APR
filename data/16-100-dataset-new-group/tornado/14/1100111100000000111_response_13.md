The issue seems to be related to the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The problem arises when `make_current` is None, and the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked to see if it's None. If it is None, then `self.make_current()` is called. However, if `make_current` is not None, then again the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked, and if it's None, a `RuntimeError` is raised.

The issue seems to be with the logic of the conditions and the usage of the `make_current` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for existing `IOLoop`.

The corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  #Removed the elif condition
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we removed the `elif` condition and changed the logic of the `if` condition for `make_current`. Now, if `make_current` is not None, it will directly check if the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None and raise a `RuntimeError` if it already exists. Otherwise, it will call `self.make_current()`.

This change should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
