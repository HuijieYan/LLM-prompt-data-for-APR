### Potential Error
The potential error in the buggy function is that the condition `if make_current is None` is not being evaluated correctly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the condition `if make_current is None` is not properly checking for the value of `make_current`. This causes the function to incorrectly execute the `elif make_current` block when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to explicitly check if `make_current` is `None` using `if make_current is None`, and then handle the `True` case separately.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# this is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # If make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
