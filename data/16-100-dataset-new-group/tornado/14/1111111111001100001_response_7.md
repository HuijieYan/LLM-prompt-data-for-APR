The cause of the bug in the `initialize` function seems to be that it is not properly handling the `make_current` parameter. In the failing test `test_force_current`, the `IOLoop` is being initialized with `make_current=True`, and then an attempt is made to initialize another `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the test is not behaving as expected.

The issue seems to be with the logic in the `initialize` function, where it checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, but it doesn't properly handle the case where `make_current` is `False`. Additionally, the logic around checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists is not correct.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and the logic around checking the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
- We store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the `current_instance` variable to avoid calling it multiple times.
- We properly handle the case where `make_current` is `False` by not attempting to make the current `IOLoop`.
- We check if `make_current` is `True` and if a current instance exists, and raise a `RuntimeError` if both conditions are met.
- We then check if `make_current` is `True` and make the current `IOLoop` if that's the case.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
