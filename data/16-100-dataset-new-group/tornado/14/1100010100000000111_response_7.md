Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not handled correctly for the `make_current` option when it is None.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not properly handled. The function initializes the IOLoop without checking if it already exists, leading to the RuntimeError being raised even when the IOLoop is None.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to handle the condition when `make_current` is None differently and only call `self.make_current()` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before raising a RuntimeError, we ensure that the function handles the case when the IOLoop already exists properly. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
