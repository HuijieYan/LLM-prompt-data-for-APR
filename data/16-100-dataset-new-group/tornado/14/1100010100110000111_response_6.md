The issue seems to be related to the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, a `RuntimeError` is being raised, indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional statement for checking if the current IOLoop already exists. This conditional statement seems to be causing the bug.

The cause of the bug seems to be that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function checks if the current IOLoop exists and immediately raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. This behavior is contradictory because if `make_current=True`, it should try to make the IOLoop current, not raise an error if it already exists.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement responsible for checking if the current IOLoop exists needs to be revised. Instead of immediately raising a `RuntimeError`, it should attempt to make the IOLoop current if it does not exist.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            # IOLoop already exists, no need to do anything
            pass
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current=True`, the function checks if the current IOLoop exists and, if it does, does nothing. If it does not exist, it makes the IOLoop current. This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the function behave as expected.
