The issue is with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class, where it checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is set to `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

The bug occurs because when `make_current` is set to `True`, the code should check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raise an error if it does, but instead, it incorrectly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance does not exist and then raises the error.

To fix the bug, the condition in the `initialize` function should be reversed so that it checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` and only raises an error if one exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, preventing the `RuntimeError` from being raised in this scenario.
