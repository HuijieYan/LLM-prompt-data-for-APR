The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the conditional logic for the `make_current` parameter. The logic inside the `if` and `elif` statements is contradictory and results in unexpected behavior.

When `make_current` is `None`, the function checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it is `None`, then it calls `self.make_current()`.

However, when `make_current` is not `None`, the function first checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`, and if it is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")`. If it is `None`, it then calls `self.make_current()`.

This logic results in conflicting behavior, where it tries to make the current instance of `IOLoop` if it does not exist, and at the same time raises an error if the current instance does exist.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function should be simplified to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is simplified. When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` and makes it the current instance if it is. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is not `None`, and if it is not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. Then it makes the current instance.
