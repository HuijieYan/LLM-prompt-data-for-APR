# Analyze the buggy function
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop, but it contains conditional logic that could lead to potential errors.

# Potential error locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function include:
- Incorrect usage of `self.make_current()` without checking if it exists
- Inconsistent logic for checking if the IOLoop is already current

# Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where `make_current` is True, but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` already exists. This can lead to a RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

# Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic to accurately check for the existence of the current IOLoop before attempting to make it current.

# Corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
