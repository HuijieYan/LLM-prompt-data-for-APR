The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class seems to be designed to initialize the IOLoop instance and optionally make it the current instance. However, the bug seems to be in the logic of checking and setting the current IOLoop instance.

The bug is likely caused by the `initialize` function not handling the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. This results in the RuntimeError not being raised as expected in the test case `test_force_current`.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should first check if `make_current` is True and if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If so, it should immediately raise the RuntimeError. If `make_current` is not specified and there is no current instance, it should then make the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance:
            if make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` argument and raise the RuntimeError when necessary. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
