The buggy function is a method called `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class. It takes an optional parameter `make_current`, which is set to `None` by default.

The failing test is trying to create an instance of the `IOLoop` class with `make_current` set to `True`.

The error message indicates that the bug occurs in the `initialize` method when `make_current` is `True`. It fails with a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".

Looking at the code, the bug seems to be in the conditional statement:
```python
if make_current is None:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
elif make_current:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```

The bug seems to be in the logic of the conditional statements. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and then raises a `RuntimeError` if it is, but the intention of setting `make_current` to `True` is to create a new `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement needs to be updated in such a way that when `make_current` is `True`, it should directly call `self.make_current()` without checking for the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other methods

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # Removed the elif and condition for make_current
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will create a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.
