### 1. Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` takes an input parameter `make_current` and initializes the current IOLoop.

### 2. Potential Error Locations
The issue could be with the conditional statements that check the current IOLoop instance and make the current IOLoop.

### 3. Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the conditional statements in the `initialize` function are not handling the `make_current` parameter properly. It does not account for the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, resulting in the RuntimeError not being raised when it should.

### 4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`. This will ensure that the RuntimeError is raised as expected when a second `make_current=True` construction is attempted.

### 5. Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
