### Analysis
The error message indicates that the function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current` is not `None`. The GitHub issue also points out this inconsistency.

### Identified Error Location
The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current IOLoop and the logic for raising the `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop is inconsistent. When `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance is not `None`, the function should not raise a `RuntimeError` since the IOLoop already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop should be adjusted. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should simply return without raising an error if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current or (make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None):
        self.make_current()
```
