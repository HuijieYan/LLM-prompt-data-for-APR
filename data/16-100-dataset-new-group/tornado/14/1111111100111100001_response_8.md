The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current IOLoop when `make_current` is `True`. However, the error message indicates that the current IOLoop already exists, causing the RuntimeError.

The bug occurs because the logic for checking the current IOLoop's existence is incorrect. The condition `if make_current is None` should only check if the current IOLoop exists if `make_current` is not provided, but it incorrectly tries to set the current IOLoop in this case. This leads to the RuntimeError when `make_current` is set to `True`.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function should be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is provided as `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Handle the make_current parameter explicitly
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and avoid setting the current IOLoop inappropriately, addressing the RuntimeError that occurred in the failing test.
