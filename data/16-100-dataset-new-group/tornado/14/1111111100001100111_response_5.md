### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before making it the current instance. However, the logic is flawed, as it should only raise an error if `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current instance. The current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check if a current instance already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
