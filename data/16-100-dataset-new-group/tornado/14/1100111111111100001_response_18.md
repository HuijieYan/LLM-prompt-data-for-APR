The buggy function `initialize` is failing because it is not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` properly. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should first check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if it does, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The corrected strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`, ensuring that it checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make it current.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This modification ensures that when `make_current` is `True`, the method checks if the current `IOLoop` already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does.

With this correction, the failing test case should pass as the `initialize` function now properly handles the case when `make_current` is `True`.
