The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error when the `make_current` parameter is set to True. The issue on GitHub points to line 252 in the `ioloop.py` file where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for None, and questions why the "already exists" error is raised.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is True, the function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if not, it raises a RuntimeError, even though it should create a new IOLoop instance. This suggests that the conditional logic within the if statement is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic within the if statement needs to be updated. The if statement `if make_current:` should be changed to `elif make_current is None:` and the conditional logic inside that block should be modified to create a new IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.current().close(all_fds=True)
            self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the bug should be fixed and the function should pass the failing test, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
