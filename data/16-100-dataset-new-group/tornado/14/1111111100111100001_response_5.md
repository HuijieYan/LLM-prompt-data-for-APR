The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current IOLoop instance, but it is failing when `make_current` is set to `True`. 

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if a current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, then it should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the current implementation is not checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance before setting a new one.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the variable `current_instance`. Then, we use this variable to check if a current IOLoop instance exists based on the value of `make_current`, and we raise a `RuntimeError` if necessary.
