The buggy function `initialize` is failing the test because it is not correctly checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. The bug occurs when the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even though the current IOLoop instance does not exist.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and then create a new one only if one does not exist.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and raise a `RuntimeError` only if an instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
