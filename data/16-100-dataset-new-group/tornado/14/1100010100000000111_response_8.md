## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is being checked, and then the code is attempting to raise an error "current IOLoop already exists" without checking if the IOLoop is not None. This leads to the wrong error message being raised when the IOLoop is already existing.

To fix the bug, the corrected version checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before raising the RuntimeError.

The corrected version includes this fix and will resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
