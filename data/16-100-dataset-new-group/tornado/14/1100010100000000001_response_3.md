## Analysis and Bug Identification
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, but there are some potential issues in the code.

1. The `make_current` parameter is not being used properly.
2. There is potential for a logic error when checking if the current IOLoop already exists.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the code seems to be related to the handling of the `make_current` parameter. The code is not properly checking whether a current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to make it the current instance.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic of the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check if a current IOLoop instance already exists. Additionally, we should ensure that the function follows best practices for error handling and exception raising.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False) # Get the current IOLoop instance
    
    if make_current:  # Check if make_current is True
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise an error if current IOLoop already exists
        self.make_current()  # Make the current IOLoop
    elif make_current is not None:  # If make_current is explicitly set to False
        if not current_instance:  # Check if no current instance exists
            self.make_current()  # Make the IOLoop current

# rest of the code...
```

In the corrected version, we have properly handled the `make_current` parameter. We also check for the presence of a current IOLoop instance before attempting to make it the current instance. Additionally, we follow good practice by raising a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists.
