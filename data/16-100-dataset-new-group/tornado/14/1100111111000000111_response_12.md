## An analysis of the buggy function

The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. This function takes a `make_current` parameter and is responsible for initializing the IOLoop.

The issue on GitHub references `line 252`, which corresponds to the check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. The problem seems to be that even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, the code still goes to the `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` line.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The `if` condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might not be working as expected.
2. The logic in the `initialize` function might not be handling the `make_current` parameter correctly.

## Cause of the bug

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter and the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `make_current` parameter is handled correctly, and the check for an existing IOLoop is done accurately. This might involve modifying the condition in the `initialize` function and ensuring that the `make_current` logic works as expected.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for checking the existing IOLoop and handling the `make_current` parameter has been adjusted. The condition for raising a `RuntimeError` has been modified to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, and the `make_current` call has been updated accordingly.

This corrected version should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the test function `test_force_current` passes successfully.
