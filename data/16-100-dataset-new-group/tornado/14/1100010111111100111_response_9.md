The buggy function `initialize` in the file `tornado/ioloop.py` is causing the test `test_force_current` in the file `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` to fail with the error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the `if make_current is None:` condition and the subsequent `self.make_current()` call.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the condition `if make_current is None:` evaluates to `False`, so the code directly goes to the `elif make_current:` block and checks if the current IOLoop already exists. Since the current IOLoop is found to exist, it raises the `RuntimeError` even though the intention is to create a new IOLoop.

To fix the bug, the `if make_current is None:` condition should be updated so that when `make_current` is `True`, it goes to the `elif` block to create a new IOLoop. Additionally, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should be removed from the `elif` block.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # Changed this condition to directly create a new IOLoop
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the test case `test_force_current` should pass, and the GitHub issue related to this bug should be resolved.
