The cause of the bug is that the `make_current` parameter is not being used correctly in the `initialize` function. It is expected that when `make_current` is `True`, the `self.make_current()` should be called. However, the code is also checking whether `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` in both the `if` and `elif` conditions, which is redundant and may not be necessary.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the code by checking if `make_current` is `True` and calling `self.make_current()` directly. We can remove the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` as it seems unnecessary.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("Invalid value for make_current")
```
