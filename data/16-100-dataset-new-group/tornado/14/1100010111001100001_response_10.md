The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the current IOLoop. However, the bug is causing it to fail the test `test_force_current` when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The potential error in the buggy function is with the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:`. This condition is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists, but it is not working as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not properly checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance, leading to the incorrect behavior when `make_current` is set to `True`.

To fix the bug, we can update the condition to properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. We can also refactor the logic to ensure that the IOLoop is properly initialized regardless of the value of `make_current`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
