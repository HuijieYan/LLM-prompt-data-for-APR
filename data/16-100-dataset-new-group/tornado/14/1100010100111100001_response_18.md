The buggy function is the `initialize` method in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The error message is indicating that the `RuntimeError` is being raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

Potential error location:
The issue seems to be occurring when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`.

Cause of the bug:
When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function is not checking if the current IOLoop already exists. Instead, it directly attempts to make the current IOLoop which leads to the RuntimeError being raised when it already exists.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to first check if the current IOLoop exists before attempting to make it the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this correction, the function will first check if the current IOLoop exists before attempting to make it the current IOLoop, which should resolve the RuntimeError being raised.
