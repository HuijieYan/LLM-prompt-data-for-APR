The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and optionally make it the current IOLoop. However, the bug in the function causes it to not handle the `make_current` parameter correctly, leading to a RuntimeError in the failing test `test_force_current`.

The bug is primarily in the conditional logic of the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if a current IOLoop already exists, and if not, make the current IOLoop. However, the current implementation is not handling this case properly, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that it only makes the IOLoop the current one if no other current IOLoop exists.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this fixed version, the function correctly checks for the existence of a current IOLoop before attempting to make the IOLoop the current one. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
