The bug in the `initialize` function of `tornado/ioloop.py` is causing the `test_force_current` test in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` to fail. The failing test is trying to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True`, but the bug causes the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" to be raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. This should only happen when there is no current IOLoop and hence there should be no `RuntimeError` raised in this case.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and raise the `RuntimeError` only if there is already a current IOLoop when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will now correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop and raise a `RuntimeError` only when necessary. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `test_force_current` pass.
