The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class. The function is using the `make_current` parameter and the `current` method from the same class and related functions `current` and `make_current` from the same file.

Potential error locations: 
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` seems to be incorrect as it is calling the `current` method from the class instead of the function. 
2. The use of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function may cause unintended behavior.

Cause of the bug: 
The bug seems to be caused by the confusion between the `current` method and the `current` function and the incorrect use of the `make_current` parameter.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct syntax to call the `current` function from the related function.
2. Remove the unnecessary use of the `make_current` parameter and simplify the logic within the `initialize` function.

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self):
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `initialize` function no longer takes the `make_current` parameter and the logic is simplified to check if the current instance is None and then make it the current instance. This should fix the bug and simplify the function.
