### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `initialize` method is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which is contradictory.

### Potential error locations:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditionals for `make_current` and the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

### Bug cause:
The `initialize` method is not handling the conditions for `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` properly. When `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it should not raise the `RuntimeError` as indicated by the error message.

### Bug fix strategy:
The conditionals for `make_current` and the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` need to be re-evaluated and modified to handle the conditions correctly.

### Corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the `initialize` method modifies the condition for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` when `make_current` is True. Now, if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, it will raise the `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" as expected.

After making this correction, the failing test should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
