The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` correctly. It should always check if the current IOLoop exists and, if not, make the current IOLoop. However, the current implementation only checks if the current IOLoop exists when `make_current` is `None`. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop exists and then raises an error if it does. This is incorrect behavior and causes the failing test `test_force_current` to fail.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should check if the IOLoop is the current instance and, if not, make it the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass.
