The buggy initialize function in the IOLoop class is intended to initialize the IOLoop object and optionally set it as the current loop. The buggy function is causing an error when attempting to initialize a new IOLoop with make_current=True, where it checks if a current IOLoop already exists and raises a RuntimeError if so. The issue seems to be with the conditional logic in the initialize function.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect logic in the conditional statements. When make_current is set to True, the bug function should only raise a RuntimeError if a current IOLoop already exists. However, the buggy code also checks if a current IOLoop does not exist. This is conflicting logic and causing the error when trying to initialize a new IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the initialize function need to be updated. Specifically, the elif condition should be removed as it is causing the conflicting logic. The updated code should check if make_current is True and only raise a RuntimeError if a current IOLoop exists.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this corrected initialize function, the test_force_current test should pass without raising a RuntimeError.
