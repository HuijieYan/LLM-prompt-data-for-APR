### Analysis
The `initialize` function is a part of the `IOLoop` class defined in the `tornado.ioloop` module. The function is responsible for initializing the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument.

### Identified Errors
1. The `initialize` function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` but it doesn't handle the case when it actually returns an instance.

### Cause of the Bug
The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function is raising an error even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None. This is inconsistent and indicates a bug in the function's logic. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns an instance, and when it returns None. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected in both scenarios.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            # Handle the case when IOLoop.current returns an instance
            pass
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we added an `else` block to handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns an instance. We also updated the condition for checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is True. These changes should address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
