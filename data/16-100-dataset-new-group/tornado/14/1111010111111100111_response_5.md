The buggy function `initialize()` in the IOLoop class is intended to initialize a new IOLoop instance and make it the current IOLoop, but there is a bug that causes the function to incorrectly raise a RuntimeError when the `make_current=True` argument is provided.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `if make_current is None` condition is possibly incorrectly falling through to the `self.make_current()` call when it should not.
2. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` may not be properly evaluating the current IOLoop instance.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to stem from the conditional logic around the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current=True` is passed, the function incorrectly checks if an IOLoop already exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does. This is contrary to the expected behavior, causing the failing test to occur.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, remove the check for the existence of the current IOLoop when `make_current=True`. Instead, always call `self.make_current()` without any prior checks when `make_current` is either `None` or `True`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current in [None, True]:
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will always attempt to make the newly initialized IOLoop the current IOLoop if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, as indicated in the failing test. This should address the bug and ensure that the failing test passes.
