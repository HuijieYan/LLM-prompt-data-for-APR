The bug in the `initialize` function is that it raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` is passed, even when the current IOLoop does not exist.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to handle the case when `make_current=True` by checking if there is already a current IOLoop instance, and only raise a `RuntimeError` if one already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test.
