The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop by setting the current instance if it does not already exist. However, the current implementation has a bug where the `make_current` parameter is not being properly handled.

The bug occurs because the `make_current` parameter is not being properly checked. The logic is only checking if `make_current` is None or True, but it should also be checking if it is False.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that the IOLoop is initialized correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif not make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
