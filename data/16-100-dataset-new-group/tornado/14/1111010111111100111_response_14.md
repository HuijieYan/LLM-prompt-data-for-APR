To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we need to address the logic for checking if a current IOLoop exists and whether to make the current IOLoop.

The problem with the current implementation is that it always tries to make the IOLoop current if `make_current` is not specified (or is None), which can cause conflicts if there is already a current IOLoop. Additionally, when `make_current=True`, it should raise an error if a current IOLoop already exists, but the current implementation doesn't check for this condition properly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle cases where a current IOLoop already exists, and to correctly set the IOLoop as the current one under the right conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is `True`. If it is, we verify that a current IOLoop instance doesn't exist, and if it does, we raise an error. Then, in the case where `make_current` is not specified (or is `None`), we only make the IOLoop current if there is no current instance already.

With these corrections, the `initialize` function should now handle the cases of making the IOLoop current correctly without conflicting with existing instances.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and should also pass the failing test `test_force_current` mentioned earlier.
