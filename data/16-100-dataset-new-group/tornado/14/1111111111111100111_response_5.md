To fix this bug, we need to address the issue where the `initialize` function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True` even if a current `IOLoop` instance does not already exist.

The problem is caused by the logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If it is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, it should only raise the `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

To fix this, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check the condition correctly and only raise the `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
