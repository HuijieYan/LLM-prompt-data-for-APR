The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a few issues. First, it is not correctly checking if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. Second, it is not properly handling the `make_current` parameter. 

The main cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not checking if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make it current.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and also check if the current instance already exists before making it current.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With these changes, the function will correctly check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make it current. This should resolve the bug and make the test `test_force_current` pass.
