## Explaination
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop, but there is a problem in the logic for checking if the current IOLoop already exists. The code is checking if the IOLoop current instance is None in both the conditions, which is causing the RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance to ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when the IOLoop already exists.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance` and then use it to check if the IOLoop already exists or not, ensuring that the RuntimeError is only raised when necessary.

With this corrected version, the bug should be fixed, and the corresponding GitHub issue should be resolved.
