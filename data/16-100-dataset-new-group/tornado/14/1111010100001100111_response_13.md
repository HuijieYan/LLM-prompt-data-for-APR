## Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if make_current is None` may not be capturing the intended logic correctly.
2. The logic inside the `if make_current is None` block may not be setting the current IOLoop properly.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the conditional logic inside the `initialize` function is not checking whether the current IOLoop instance exists properly. The condition `if make_current is None` might be incorrect, and the logic to handle the current IOLoop is not functioning as intended.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Use a different approach to check whether the current IOLoop instance exists.
2. Implement a clear logic to handle the current IOLoop based on the value of `make_current`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods)

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_ioloop is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
