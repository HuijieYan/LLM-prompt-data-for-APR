### Issues with the buggy function

1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance, and it takes an optional argument `make_current` to control whether the new `IOLoop` instance should become the current instance.
2. Based on the issue in GitHub, there seems to be a problem with the logic at line 252, where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and then raises a RuntimeError.

### Potential Errors

The potential cause of the bug seems to be in the logic of the `initialize` function where it checks the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Cause of the Bug

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is not handling the `make_current` argument properly, and the condition to check for the presence of an existing `IOLoop` instance is leading to the incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

The `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` argument. It should create a new `IOLoop` instance if one does not exist, and if `make_current` is set to `True`, it should make the new instance the current instance.

### Corrected Version

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Fix: Correct the condition to check if make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: Correct the condition to check if current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditions in the `initialize` function have been modified to properly check for the presence of the current `IOLoop` instance and handle the `make_current` argument. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the failing test pass.
