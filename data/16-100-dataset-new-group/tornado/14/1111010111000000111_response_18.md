The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional statements that check for the current IOLoop. There seems to be an issue in handling the `make_current` argument.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument. It is intended to make the current IOLoop instance, but the conditional logic is not functioning as expected.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional statements to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that the current IOLoop is properly managed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function now correctly handles the `make_current` argument and ensures that the current IOLoop is managed without any conflicting instances.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
