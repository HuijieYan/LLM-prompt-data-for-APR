The buggy function `initialize` is a part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The function is meant to initialize the IOLoop instance and set it as the current IOLoop if needed.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is checking if the current instance of IOLoop is None, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The `self.make_current()` function is being called without proper handling or error checking.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when the current IOLoop instance already exists, leading to the RuntimeError being raised inappropriately.

To fix the bug, a proper strategy would be to modify the `initialize` function to handle the case when the current IOLoop instance already exists, and to set the IOLoop instance as current if needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check the current instance of IOLoop and then handle the `make_current` argument accordingly. This ensures that the function behaves as intended and doesn't raise a RuntimeError unnecessarily.
