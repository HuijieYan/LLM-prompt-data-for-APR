To fix this bug, let's first analyze the code and the related functions. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists using the `current` function and then calls the `make_current` function if necessary. The issue on GitHub points out that the `initialize` function is raising an error even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which seems incorrect.

The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and the calls to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement `if make_current is None` is not properly handling the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. It is incorrectly calling `self.make_current()`.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional statements to correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` using `if not` and `if is not None` respectively, and then perform the required actions accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
