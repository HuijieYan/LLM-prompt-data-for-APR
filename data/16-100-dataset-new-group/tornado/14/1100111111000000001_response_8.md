# Fixed version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The cause of the bug is that the `IOLoop.` prefix is missing in the buggy function, causing it to reference the wrong `current` and `make_current` functions. 

The strategy for fixing the bug is to make sure that the correct class reference `self` is used for calling the `current` and `make_current` functions within the `initialize` method.

The corrected version of the buggy function will now correctly reference the `current` and `make_current` functions within the `IOLoop` class, using `self.current` and `self.make_current`.
