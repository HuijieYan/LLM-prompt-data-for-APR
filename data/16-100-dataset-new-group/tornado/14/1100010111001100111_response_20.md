### Error Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `if make_current is None` condition might not be handling the scenario as expected.
2. The logic for checking and handling the current IOLoop instance might not be correct.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly. It is failing the test because it does not properly check if the current IOLoop already exists. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised when it should not be, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance. It should only raise a RuntimeError if a current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the function checks for the current IOLoop instance before making any decisions based on the `make_current` parameter. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
