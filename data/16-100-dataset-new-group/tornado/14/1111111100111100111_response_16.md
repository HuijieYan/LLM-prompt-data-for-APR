## Corrected version of the buggy function

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The bug in the original function was due to a logical error in the condition for checking whether the current IOLoop already exists. The `if` condition was checking for `None` when it should have been checking for `not None`, and vice versa. Additionally, the original function was calling `IOLoop.current` instead of `self.current`, resulting in a wrong method being called.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues by using the correct method for checking the current IOLoop and adjusting the conditional checks to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
