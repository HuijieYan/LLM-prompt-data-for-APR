### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. The function should create a new `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current instance only if there is no current instance already. However, the current implementation fails to handle this case correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly check if an instance of IOLoop already exists and then conditionally make it the current instance based on the value of `make_current`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
