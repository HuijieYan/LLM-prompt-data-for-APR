The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object and set it as the current object if `make_current` is `True`. However, the function is not working as expected and is failing the test.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking the condition for `make_current`. It checks if `make_current` is `None` and then tries to make the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist. However, if `make_current` is `True`, it should also check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. We need to check if `make_current` is `True` and if the current IOLoop already exists, and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. Otherwise, we should proceed with making the IOLoop the current object.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test.
