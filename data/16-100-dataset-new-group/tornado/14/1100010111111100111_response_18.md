The potential error location in the buggy function is the conditional statement that checks if the IOLoop.current() is None before making it the current IOLoop.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic inside the initialize function is incorrect. It checks if IOLoop.current() is None before making it the current IOLoop, but then it also checks if IOLoop.current() is None before raising an error if make_current is True. This contradictory logic causes the RuntimeError to be raised even when make_current is True and IOLoop.current() is None.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic needs to be adjusted. The function should only raise an error if make_current is True and IOLoop.current() is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: Changed the condition to check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
