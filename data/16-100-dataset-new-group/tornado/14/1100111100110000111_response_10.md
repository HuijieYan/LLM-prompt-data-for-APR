### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop. It checks if the current IOLoop exists and then either creates a new one or raises an error if one already exists. The error message suggests that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop exists is not working as expected.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is within the conditional statements that check if the current IOLoop exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not correctly evaluating whether the current IOLoop exists or not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the conditional statements need to be reviewed to ensure that the check for the existence of the current IOLoop is accurate. This may involve modifying the condition or adjusting the logic to properly detect if the IOLoop already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the conditions have been modified to check if the current IOLoop is not None before performing the actions in the `initialize` function. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the `initialize` function behaves as expected.
