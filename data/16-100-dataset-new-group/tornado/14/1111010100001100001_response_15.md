The cause of the bug in the initialize function is that it checks for the current instance of IOLoop with the instance=False parameter, which is incorrect. It should be checking for the current instance with instance=True.

To fix the bug, the initialize function should be modified to correctly check for the current instance of IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now properly check for the current instance of IOLoop and raise an error if it already exists when make_current is True.
