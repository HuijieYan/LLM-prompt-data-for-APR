## Analysis:
The `initialize` function is a method of the `IOLoop` class and it is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. The function takes an argument `make_current` which is used to control whether the new `IOLoop` instance should become the current one.

## Identified Errors:
1. The `make_current` function is called without being defined within the `IOLoop` class.

2. The `IOLoop.current()` function is called with the argument `instance` which is not a valid argument for this function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `make_current` function is not defined within the `IOLoop` class and the `IOLoop.current()` function is not being called correctly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `make_current` function within the `IOLoop` class.

2. Modify the call to `IOLoop.current()` to remove the invalid argument `instance=False`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class definitions)

    def make_current(self):
        # code to set the current IOLoop instance
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
