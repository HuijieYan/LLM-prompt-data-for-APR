The buggy function "initialize" in the "IOLoop" class is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object. The issue reported on GitHub revolves around the discrepancy between the condition check and the subsequent error message in the buggy function. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional checks for the value of "make_current" and the subsequent error handling logic.

The cause of the bug is that in the "initialize" function, when the "make_current" argument is set to True and the "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" is None, it raises a RuntimeError with the message "current IOLoop already exists". However, this behavior is contradictory because "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" being None should indicate that the IOLoop doesn't exist, leading to confusion for users encountering this issue.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks in the "initialize" function should be modified to reflect the actual state of the IOLoop instance. The logic for handling the "make_current" argument needs to be adjusted to align with the expected behavior based on the "IOLoop.current" status.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the "initialize" function checks the current status of the IOLoop instance and behaves accordingly based on the value of the "make_current" argument. This updated logic ensures that the function operates as intended and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
