The error is occurring because the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function is not working correctly, as indicated by the error message "RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists". This is causing the function to raise an error when the current IOLoop already exists, even though it should attempt to make the IOLoop current if it does not already exist.

To fix the bug, the logic for the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to handle the case where the IOLoop already exists and to attempt to make it current if it does not exist.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `if` condition for `make_current` has been adjusted to check for the existence of the current IOLoop and raise an error if it already exists. If `make_current` is None, it will attempt to make the IOLoop current if it does not already exist.
