The problem lies in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class where the `make_current` parameter is not working as expected. This is causing the RuntimeError to be raised even when the IOLoop.current() is None. The issue is reported on GitHub with the title "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None."

The cause of the bug is that the conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. This is leading to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is true, the initialization process correctly determines if an IOLoop already exists before trying to make the current IOLoop.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version, we check if `make_current` is true and if an IOLoop instance already exists. If both conditions are met, a RuntimeError will be raised as expected.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
