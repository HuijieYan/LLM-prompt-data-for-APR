The bug is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The issue stems from the conditional check for the `make_current` parameter, where if `make_current` is `None`, it should check if there's a current `IOLoop` and make it the current one. While if `make_current` is `True`, it should verify if there's a current `IOLoop` and raise an error if there is.

The root cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current is None:` should check if a current `IOLoop` exists, and if not, make it the current one using `self.make_current()`. 

To resolve this bug, the conditional checks in the `initialize` method need to be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly check for a current `IOLoop` based on the `make_current` parameter and make necessary adjustments.

This correction should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and also pass the failing test case.
