The problem with the buggy function `initialize` is that it is not properly handling the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should check if a current `IOLoop` already exists and raise an error if it does, but it is not doing that correctly.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to check if a current `IOLoop` exists and raise an error if `make_current` is True and a current instance is already present.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the `make_current` argument properly and pass the failing test.
