The bug in the initialize function within the IOLoop class is that when make_current is None, it checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if so, it calls self.make_current(). However, if make_current is not None, it still checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None before deciding to raise an error or call self.make_current(). This seems redundant and contradictory.

It seems that the intention of the code is to check if a current IOLoop instance exists and to make the current IOLoop instance or raise an error based on the value of the make_current argument.

To fix this bug, the conditional statements inside the initialize function need to be restructured so that it makes a decision based solely on the value of the make_current argument.

Here's a corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first retrieve the current_instance using IOLoop.current(instance=False) and then make a decision based on the value of make_current. If make_current is None, it checks if a current_instance exists and makes it the current instance. If make_current is not None, it checks whether to raise an error or make the current instance based solely on the value of make_current. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and fix the bug.
