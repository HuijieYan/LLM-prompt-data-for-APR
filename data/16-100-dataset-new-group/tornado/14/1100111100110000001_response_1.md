The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set up the IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current instance. The error message indicates that the bug is related to the logic for checking if a current IOLoop instance already exists.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional statement that checks whether a current IOLoop instance exists or not.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is set to True, the function checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and erroneously raises a RuntimeError when it finds one. This is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement that checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance should be modified to only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and there is no existing instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and there is an existing IOLoop instance.
