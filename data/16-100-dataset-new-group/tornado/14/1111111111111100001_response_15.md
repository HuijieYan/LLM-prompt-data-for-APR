The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it incorrectly checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` is passed. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised when it shouldn't be.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the fixed version, the check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is changed to `if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None` to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`.

This should resolve the issue and the failing test should now pass.
