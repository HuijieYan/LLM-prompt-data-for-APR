## Analysis
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to check if an instance of `IOLoop` is already the current instance and make it the current instance if it is not. However, there seems to be a logic error in the `initialize` function that is causing it to raise a `RuntimeError` when it should not.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are the conditional statements that check for the value of `make_current`.

## Cause of the Bug
The `initialize` function has a logic issue where it checks whether `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True`. This logic is contradictory, as checking if the current instance is `None` should not raise an error if `make_current` is `True`. This is causing the failing test case to raise a `RuntimeError` when it should not.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic in the `initialize` function correctly handles the cases where `make_current` is `True` or `False`. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    ... (existing class documentation)

    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the conditional statement in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `True` or `False`. Now, it should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test case pass.
