The buggy function `initialize` is meant to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` class, making it the current instance if `make_current` is specified. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that need to be addressed.

Firstly, the function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, and then tries to call `self.make_current()`. This logic is flawed because it should be checking if `make_current` is `True` or not, rather than `None`.

Secondly, the `if` condition for `make_current` is not structured properly. It checks if `make_current` is `True` and if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, and then raises an error if there is already a current instance. This logic is also flawed and can be simplified.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic needs to be restructured to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and when it is not specified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:  # If make_current is not specified
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # If make_current is specified
        if make_current and current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first retrieve the current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then, based on the value of `make_current`, we proceed to handle the initialization. If `make_current` is `None`, we check if there is no current instance and make it the current instance if necessary. If `make_current` is specified, we check if a current instance already exists and raise an error if so, or make it the current instance if not.
