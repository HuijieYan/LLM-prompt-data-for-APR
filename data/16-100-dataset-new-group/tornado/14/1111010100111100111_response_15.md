The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. This behavior is incorrect because the error message suggests that a current IOLoop exists when it actually does not.

The bug is likely due to a logic error in the `initialize` function where it should actually check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`. However, the current implementation is raising the error when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, leading to confusion and incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function should be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the implementation of the `IOLoop.current` method to ensure it properly tracks the current instance of `IOLoop`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should behave as expected and pass the failing test. It correctly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current` and raises the `RuntimeError` with the appropriate message when necessary.
