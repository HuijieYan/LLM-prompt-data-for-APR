Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The condition `if make_current is None` statement does not seem to be appropriately handled.
- There seems to be a contradiction between the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the subsequent `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` statement.


Explanation of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the logic in the `initialize` function of `ioloop.py`. The issue indicates a contradiction in the logic where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, but then it raises an error stating that "current IOLoop already exists". This suggests that there is a potential issue in how the current IOLoop instance is being checked and handled in the function.


Strategy for fixing the bug:
A possible strategy for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the logic of the `initialize` function and ensuring that the conditions and error handling are correctly implemented. There may be a need to re-evaluate the `make_current` parameter and its impact on the function's behavior. Additionally, thorough testing is required to ensure that the function behaves as expected in different scenarios.


Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is assigned to a variable `current_instance` before being used in the conditional statements. This ensures consistent behavior and eliminates the potential for the function to behave erratically. Additionally, the conditions and error handling have been revised to align with the expected logic. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
