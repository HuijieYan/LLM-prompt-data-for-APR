## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` object and managing the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug seems to be related to the logic for checking and setting the current `IOLoop` instance.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The assignment of the `make_current` attribute.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. The function is trying to raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is None, but the condition check is not correctly implemented.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to update the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and setting the `make_current` attribute.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods and attributes
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We have updated the logic to first check if `make_current` is True.
- If `make_current` is True, we check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None, and if it is not None, we raise a RuntimeError.
- If `make_current` is False, we check if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if it is None, we set the current `IOLoop` instance.
