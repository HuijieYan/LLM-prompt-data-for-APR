The buggy function `initialize` is designed to make the current IOLoop instance. The bug in this function is that it does not correctly handle the logic for making the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. 

The cause of the bug can be identified from the failing test `test_force_current` which is attempting to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. The buggy function is not handling this case correctly, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function needs to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and ensure that it doesn't raise an error or create a new instance if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the buggy function should pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
