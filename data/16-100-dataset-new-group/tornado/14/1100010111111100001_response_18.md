The buggy function `initialize` is failing the test `test_force_current` because it is incorrectly checking if the current IOLoop already exists. The test first creates an IOLoop with `make_current=True`, which should set it as the current IOLoop. Then, it attempts to create another IOLoop with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` since the current IOLoop already exists.

The buggy function is failing to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop already exists. It should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case, but it is not doing so correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should check if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, then it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test.
