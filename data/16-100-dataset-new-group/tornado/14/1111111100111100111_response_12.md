### Potential error locations:
1. The logic inside the `initialize` function, where the condition for checking the existence of a current `IOLoop` might be incorrect.
2. The `IOLoop.current` function might not be returning the expected value, leading to the incorrect condition evaluation.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect evaluation of the condition for the existence of a current `IOLoop`. This condition is leading to the `RuntimeError` being incorrectly raised when it should not be.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition for checking the existence of a current `IOLoop` in the `initialize` function.
2. Verify the correctness of the return value from the `IOLoop.current` function to ensure it is being properly checked.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions and declarations

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed condition here
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition for checking the existence of a current `IOLoop` is fixed. It now correctly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before deciding whether to raise the `RuntimeError`.
