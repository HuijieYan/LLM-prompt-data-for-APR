The buggy function `initialize` is meant to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and optionally make it the current instance. The bug seems to be related to the conditional logic for `make_current`.

The potential error location is within the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic in the `initialize` function does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` properly. It should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, and raise an error if there is.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional logic to properly handle the `make_current` argument.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we removed the redundant conditional statement and modified the logic to properly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.
