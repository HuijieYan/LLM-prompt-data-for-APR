To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to ensure that the correct logic is applied when checking for the current IOLoop instance and handling the `make_current` argument.

The main issue with the current implementation is that the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance and handling the `make_current` argument is incorrect.

Here's a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this correction, we first obtain the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and then we appropriately check the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current IOLoop instance to determine the correct course of action.

This correction ensures that the `make_current` argument is handled correctly and that the appropriate error is raised if the current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`.
