The bug in the function `initialize` is causing the test to fail with a `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`. 

The buggy code first checks if the `make_current` parameter is None, and if so, it checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then makes the current `IOLoop` using the `make_current` method of the class.

If the `make_current` parameter is not None and is True, it checks again if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then tries to make the current `IOLoop`. If there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

The issue is that the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` is not necessary if `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary check and directly make the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is True.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # Removed the unnecessary condition check
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly make the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is True, without unnecessarily checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.
