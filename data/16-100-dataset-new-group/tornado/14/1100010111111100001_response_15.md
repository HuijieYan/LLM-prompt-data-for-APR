#### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` function occurs because the logic to check if an IOLoop is already current is incorrect. 

When `make_current` is `True`, the buggy function checks if an IOLoop is already current. If it is, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, the buggy logic incorrectly checks for the current IOLoop instance without considering the `make_current` parameter. This leads to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised, causing the test to fail.

#### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. We need to check if `make_current` is `True` and if an IOLoop is already current, then raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, set the IOLoop as current.

#### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
