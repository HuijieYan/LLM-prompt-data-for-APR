The bug in the initialize function from the IOLoop class is causing the test_force_current to fail. The failing test attempts to create a new IOLoop instance with make_current=True, and then asserts that make_current is working as expected. However, the IOLoop.initialize initializes with a hardcoded local make_current variable, which is then checked for None, leading to the RuntimeError being raised because the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix this bug, we should modify the initialize function to accept the make_current argument and use it appropriately when setting the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass.
