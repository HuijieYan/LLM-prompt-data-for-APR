The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue with the logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. The problem lies in the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function. The function is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance, if specified. However, the logic for checking the existence of the current instance is flawed, which causes the failing test and the reported GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` correctly. This leads to the incorrect raising of the `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, a proper check for the current instance needs to be added in the `initialize` function, and the logic for setting the current instance needs to be adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None and current_instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the key fix is the addition of the condition `current_instance is not self` to accurately check if the existing current `IOLoop` instance is the same as the one being initialized.

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test. The fix also addresses the GitHub issue by ensuring the correct handling of the existing `IOLoop` instances.
