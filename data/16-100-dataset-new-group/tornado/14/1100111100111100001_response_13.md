The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize an IOLoop object and set it as the current IOLoop, but it fails to do so in certain scenarios. 

Looking at the error message, we can see that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function throws a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists. This suggests that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not working as intended.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is always evaluating to `False` because the `current` function is a method of the `IOLoop` class, and when called with `instance=False`, it will return the current IOLoop instance. Therefore, the code always thinks that the current IOLoop exists, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, we can change the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is `None` instead of checking if it's not `None`. This will correctly determine if the current IOLoop exists or not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
