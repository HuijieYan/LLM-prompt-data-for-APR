### Analysis:
1. The function `initialize` is within the `IOLoop` class and is intended to initialize the IOLoop.
2. The `initialize` function takes an optional argument `make_current`, which if not provided, checks if there is a current IOLoop and makes the current IOLoop if there isn't one. If `make_current` is provided and is `True`, it checks if there is a current IOLoop and raises an error if one already exists.
3. The issue raised on GitHub questions why the error is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
4. The cause of the bug is that the conditional check for None doesn't align with the intended logic of the function.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the conditional checks for the presence of an existing IOLoop are accurate.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` in the `initialize` function doesn't align with the intended logic. It should be checking if a current IOLoop exists and then perform the necessary action based on the value of `make_current`.

### Bug Fix:
We need to modify the condition to accurately check whether a current IOLoop exists and then make the necessary changes based on the `make_current` argument.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
