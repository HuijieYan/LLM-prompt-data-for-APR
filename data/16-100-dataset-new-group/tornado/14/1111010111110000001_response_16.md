The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class causes the failing test to produce a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". The logs point to the specific location of the bug within the `initialize` function where the `RuntimeError` is raised.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function, it attempts to make the IOLoop instance the current one. If the current IOLoop instance is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` saying the current IOLoop already exists. However, the bug is that it is not properly checking for the existing IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, the code should check if the current IOLoop instance exists and only attempt to make it the current one if it doesn't already exist.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
