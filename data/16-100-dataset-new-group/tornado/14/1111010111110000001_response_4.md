The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class seems to be related to the `make_current` argument. The failing test function `test_force_current` specifies `make_current=True` to create a new instance of `IOLoop` and then attempts to create a second instance with the same argument, which should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the current implementation is not handling the `make_current` argument correctly.

The issue is that the `initialize` method sets a default value for `make_current` as `None` but does not check if `make_current` is `None` during the condition checks. This results in the check for an already existing current IOLoop to fail and allows `make_current` to be set even if a current IOLoop exists.

To fix this bug, the condition checks for `make_current` should explicitly check if it is `None` and handle it accordingly. Additionally, the behavior when `make_current` is not specified should be similar to the behavior when `make_current` is specified as `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    # check if make_current is None
    if make_current is None:
        # explicitly check if a current IOLoop exists
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        # handle both cases when make_current is True or False
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the conditional checks for `make_current` handle the case when it is `None` correctly and ensure that an existing IOLoop is not overridden when `make_current` is specified as `True`.
