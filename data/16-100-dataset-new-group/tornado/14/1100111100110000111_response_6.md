### Cause of the bug and potential error locations

The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop. The problem arises from the condition `if make_current is None:`. When the condition is met and `make_current` is `None`, it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if the current IOLoop instance is `None`. However, there is confusion in the code regarding the intended behavior, as it is not clear whether `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` should return `None` or not. This inconsistency causes the error and the RuntimeError being raised when it is not expected.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix this bug, we need to clarify the logic and expected behavior of the `IOLoop.current` function in relation to the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. Then, based on the expected behavior, we can modify the conditions in the `initialize` function to avoid the RuntimeError and ensure that the IOLoop is initialized properly.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # existing functions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                # If current IOLoop already exists, do nothing
                return
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                # If current IOLoop already exists, raise an error
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the `initialize` function, the conditions have been adjusted to properly handle the case where the current IOLoop instance exists or not. The logic now ensures that when `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current IOLoop exists and if so, does nothing. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop already exists and raises an error, otherwise it initializes the IOLoop. This modification should resolve the issue and ensure the function behaves as expected.
