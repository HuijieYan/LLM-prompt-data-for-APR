The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing an issue where it raises a RuntimeError even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning None.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is incorrectly checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if `make_current` is None and then calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If the result is None, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, in the case where `make_current` is None, it should not raise an error even if the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to only check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:  # Changed condition to check if make_current is not None
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # Check if current IOLoop is None
            self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function should now work as expected and only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and a current `IOLoop` instance exists.
