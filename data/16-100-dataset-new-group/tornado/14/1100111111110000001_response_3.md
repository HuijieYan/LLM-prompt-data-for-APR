The buggy function has a logical error when checking for the current IOLoop instance. It incorrectly tries to check if an IOLoop instance already exists by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, which leads to the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" when it's not expected.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where an IOLoop instance already exists. We can use a class-level variable to keep track of the current IOLoop instance and update it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    current_instance = None  # Class-level variable to store the current IOLoop instance

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current_instance is None:  # Check the class-level variable instead
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current_instance is not None:  # Check if the IOLoop instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
            IOLoop.current_instance = self  # Update the class-level variable with the new instance
```

Now, the `initialize` function should properly handle the case where an IOLoop instance already exists, and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
