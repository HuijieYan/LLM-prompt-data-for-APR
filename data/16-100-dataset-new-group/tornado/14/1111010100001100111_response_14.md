Bug fix suggestion:

The issue appears to be with the logic in the `initialize` function, specifically with the handling of the `make_current` argument. The bug seems to be related to the conditional checks for `make_current` and the existing current `IOLoop`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` argument and the existing current `IOLoop` instance. Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first retrieve the current instance of `IOLoop` and then perform the conditional checks for `make_current` and `current_instance` based on the retrieved value. This should address the issue of raising "already exists" incorrectly.

Please note that the specific line numbers and context might vary based on the actual file structure and imports, so it's important to verify the line numbers and surrounding code in the actual codebase.
