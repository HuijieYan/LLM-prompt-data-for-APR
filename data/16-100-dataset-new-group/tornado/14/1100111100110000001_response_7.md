The buggy function in the provided code is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, and if `make_current` is `True`, it should also make the IOLoop the current instance, but it has a bug where it raises a RuntimeError even though it should not.

The bug occurs because the `initialize` function raises a RuntimeError when `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop. This behavior is inconsistent with the intended purpose of the function.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and there is no current IOLoop. If a current IOLoop already exists, it should just exit without raising an error.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other methods remain unchanged
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                return  # Return without raising an error if a current IOLoop already exists
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` method should pass the failing test as it addresses the bug by only raising a RuntimeError when `make_current` is True and there is no current IOLoop.
