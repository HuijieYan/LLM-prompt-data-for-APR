To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `IOLoop.initialize` function correctly initializes the IOLoop with the `make_current` parameter. The failing test `test_force_current` checks whether the `make_current=True` construction is successful and whether the `IOLoop.current()` is working as expected. The GitHub issue points out that the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None` in the buggy function, which then raises a "current IOLoop already exists" error.

To resolve this issue, we can update the `initialize` function to always set the current IOLoop if `make_current` is `True`, and raise an error if it is already set. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the `initialize` function correctly sets the current IOLoop based on the `make_current` parameter and handles any existing instances appropriately.

This should address the issue reported on GitHub and also make the `test_force_current` pass.
