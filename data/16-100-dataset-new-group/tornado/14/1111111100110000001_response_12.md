The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado/ioloop.py` file seems to be trying to set the current `IOLoop` instance. 

The bug in the function is caused by incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. Based on the error message, the problem occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to True and there is already a current instance. In this case, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists. However, in the logic before the raise statement, it is trying to check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is None. 

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `make_current is True`, and a current instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                # Do nothing if a current IOLoop instance already exists
                pass
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, if `make_current` is set to True and a current instance already exists, we simply do nothing. This should fix the bug and make the test case `test_force_current` to pass.
