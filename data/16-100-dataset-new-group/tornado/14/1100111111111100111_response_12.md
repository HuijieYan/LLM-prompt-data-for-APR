To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we need to address the condition where it checks if the current IOLoop already exists, and make sure that it behaves as expected.

The current bug occurs at the following block of code:

```python
if make_current is None:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
elif make_current:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```

The issue arises because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checked twice, and it should likely be checked only once. Additionally, the condition for `make_current` being `True` seems redundant.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic by checking for both `make_current` being `True` and the presence of a current IOLoop only once.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # previous functions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # make_current is True or False
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we remove the redundant condition for `make_current` being `True` and directly check if the current IOLoop exists. This change ensures that the logic behaves as intended and should pass the failing test case.

With this fix, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case where the current IOLoop already exists.
