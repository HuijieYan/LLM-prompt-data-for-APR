The bug in the `initialize` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The function is not properly checking if an IOLoop instance already exists before trying to make the current instance. This results in the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to correctly check if an IOLoop instance already exists before trying to make it the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if existing_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if existing_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test.
