The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, and the optional parameter `make_current` is used to determine whether to make the newly initialized IOLoop the current IOLoop. However, the bug causes a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when attempting to set the IOLoop as current.

The cause of this bug is that the logic in the `initialize` method is incorrect. When `make_current` is `True`, it should only raise an error if there is already a current IOLoop. However, the current logic raises an error regardless, leading to the failure in the test case.

One strategy to fix the bug is to change the logic in the `initialize` method to only raise an error when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop. For this, we can remove the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and directly check if `make_current` is `True`, and then check for the existence of a current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected logic, the `initialize` method will only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current IOLoop. This should resolve the bug and the specified test case should pass.
