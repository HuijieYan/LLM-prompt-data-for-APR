## Potential Error Location
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic for checking whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the logic in the initialize function is incorrect. When make_current is True, it checks if the current IOLoop doesn't exist, and then raises a RuntimeError if it does not. However, in the failing test, the IOLoop is explicitly initialized with make_current=True, resulting in the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the initialize function to correctly handle the case where make_current is True and the current IOLoop does not exist.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 
In the corrected version, when make_current is True, we first check if the current IOLoop instance exists. If it does, then we raise a RuntimeError. Otherwise, we proceed with setting the current IOLoop.
