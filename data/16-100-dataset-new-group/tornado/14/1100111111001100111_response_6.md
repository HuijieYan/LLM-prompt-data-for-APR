The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logical bug. The bug causes the `test_force_current` to fail because the `make_current` parameter is not being properly handled.

The bug is located in the `initialize` function, particularly in the `make_current` parameter check. When `make_current` is None, the function checks if the current IOLoop instance is None and then calls `self.make_current()`. However, when `make_current` is True, the function should also check whether the current IOLoop instance is already existing before calling `self.make_current()`. This check is missing, which causes the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not handle the `make_current` parameter correctly. When `make_current` is True, it should check if an IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one, but this check is missing.

To fix the bug, we should update the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is True, it should check if an IOLoop instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. If `make_current` is None, it should still check if the current IOLoop instance is None and then call `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if an IOLoop instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will properly handle the `make_current` parameter, ensuring that it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is True.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
