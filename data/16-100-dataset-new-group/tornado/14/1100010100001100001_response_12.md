### Analysis
The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance, and if the `make_current` flag is True, it should ensure that the current IOLoop instance exists. However, the logic in the function seems to be flawed, as it is not handling the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the `make_current` flag is True, and the current IOLoop instance already exists. In this case, the function should raise a RuntimeError, but it is not doing so.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is True, and raise a RuntimeError if it does.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
