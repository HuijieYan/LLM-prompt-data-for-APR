## Correction

The buggy function `initialize` is not correctly checking the status of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one. The issue reported on GitHub notes that the function raises an error when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, even though the code is written to handle this situation.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to properly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions in the class...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `if` condition for `make_current` is changed to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, and then raise a `RuntimeError` if it is not `None`.

With this fix, the function should now properly handle the situation when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and avoid raising an error incorrectly. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
