The potential error in the buggy function `initialize` is in the condition `elif make_current:`. The condition is checking the truthiness of `make_current` but it should be checking if `make_current` is True instead.

The buggy function `initialize` is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter, and the test function `test_force_current` exposes the bug by failing to raise a `RuntimeError` as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition `elif make_current:` to `elif make_current is True:` in the `initialize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
