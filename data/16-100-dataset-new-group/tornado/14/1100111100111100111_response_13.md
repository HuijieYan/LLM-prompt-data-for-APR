Based on the error message and the provided code, the issue seems to be caused by the buggy function not handling the case where `make_current` is set to `True` correctly. It is raising a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. Additionally, the condition `make_current is None` seems unnecessary and can be simplified.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check for `make_current` being `True` and handle that case accordingly. We also handle the case where `make_current` is not provided or `False` by checking for the current IOLoop instance and calling `make_current` if necessary. This should address the issue and resolve the failing test.
