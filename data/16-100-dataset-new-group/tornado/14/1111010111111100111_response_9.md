The potential error location in the buggy function is the conditional statement inside the `initialize` function, where it checks whether the current IOLoop exists or not.

The cause of the bug is that, when `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, it should raise a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists. However, in the buggy function, the check for the existing IOLoop instance is evaluated incorrectly, leading to the wrong behavior and the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should properly check if the IOLoop instance exists when `make_current` is `True`, and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. Also, when `make_current` is `None`, it should not invoke `self.make_current()` if the IOLoop instance does not exist.

Given these considerations, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
