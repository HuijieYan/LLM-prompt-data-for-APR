The bug in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class seems to be related to the `make_current` argument not being properly handled. 

Currently, the code checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and makes the `IOLoop` current using `self.make_current()` if the result is `None`. If `make_current` is not `None`, it should also check if the current `IOLoop` exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the code incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` instead of checking if it already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to have proper handling for the `make_current` argument and the checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version properly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` and raises a `RuntimeError` if it already exists. This fix should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
