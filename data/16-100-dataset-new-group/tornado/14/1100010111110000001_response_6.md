The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is not handling the `make_current` parameter properly, leading to a RuntimeError when attempting to force the current IOLoop.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional statements for `make_current`.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly checking whether a current IOLoop already exists. This results in the `make_current` parameter not functioning as intended and throwing a RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should first check if a current IOLoop exists before attempting to make a new one. If a current IOLoop already exists and `make_current` is True, it should raise a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will first check if a current IOLoop exists and raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop is already present.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
