The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. This causes the test `test_force_current` to fail because the function should raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists, but it does not.

To fix this bug, we need to change the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # No need to check if make_current is True, just handle the case where it's True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will check if the current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is `True` and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.
