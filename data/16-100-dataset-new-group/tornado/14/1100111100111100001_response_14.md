The buggy function is `initialize` within the class `IOLoop`. The purpose of this function is to initialize the IOLoop object, and it takes an optional parameter `make_current`.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and the `IOLoop.current` is not `None`. In this case, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists", but it is not doing so.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement `if make_current` is only checking if `make_current` is truthy, but it should also check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statement to also check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions in the class...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and pass the failing test.
