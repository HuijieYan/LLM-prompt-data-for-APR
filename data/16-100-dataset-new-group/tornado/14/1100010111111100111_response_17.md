The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` fails the test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` with the error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the condition where it checks if the current IOLoop already exists. If the check for the existing IOLoop is successful, it should not raise an error and proceed with the existing IOLoop instead.

The cause of the bug is that the condition to check for the existing IOLoop is incorrect. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should only raise an error if an IOLoop instance already exists. However, the current condition is checking for the opposite case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if an IOLoop instance exists and only raise an error if it does. Additionally, if the condition is not met, the function should proceed with the existing IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    if make_current or make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will correctly check for the existing IOLoop instance and handle the `make_current` parameter as intended. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
