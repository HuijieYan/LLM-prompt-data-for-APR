## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the function passes the failing test and resolves the issue posted in GitHub. The bug in the original function was that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` was missing a negation for the `make_current=True` case. This caused the RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly.

In the corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` is added for the `make_current=True` case to properly raise the RuntimeError if the current IOLoop already exists. This change fixes the bug and ensures that the function behaves as expected in the failing test case.
