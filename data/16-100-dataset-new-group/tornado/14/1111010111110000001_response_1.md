The cause of the bug is within the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The if-condition for `make_current` is incorrect, leading to the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error in the failing test.

The bug is caused by a logical error in the conditional statements of the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists. However, the current implementation is checking if the current `IOLoop` does not exist, leading to the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the logical conditions within the `initialize` function need to be updated to check whether the current `IOLoop` exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. If it does, then raise a `RuntimeError`; otherwise, set the current `IOLoop`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With these changes, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` argument correctly and avoid the `RuntimeError` in the failing test.
