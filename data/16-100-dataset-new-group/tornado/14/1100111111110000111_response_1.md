The bug in the `initialize` function inside the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is that the condition to check if the IOLoop is already current is incorrect. The `initialize` function should check if the current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to make it the current instance. However, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not correct, as it should actually be checking if the current IOLoop instance is not None.

The failing test named `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` attempts to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if `IOLoop.current()` correctly raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

The GitHub issue highlights the problem with the condition on line 252 of `tornado/ioloop.py`, which incorrectly checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` before raising "current IOLoop already exists".

To fix this bug, the condition that checks if the current IOLoop already exists should be updated to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`. This will correctly check if the IOLoop instance already exists and prevent a new instance from being created if one is already current.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function in `tornado/ioloop.py`:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
