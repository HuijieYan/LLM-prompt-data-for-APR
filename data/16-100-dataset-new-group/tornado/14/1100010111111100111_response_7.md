The bug in the `initialize` function of `tornado/ioloop.py` is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if the current IOLoop does not exist.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop is flawed. The function should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly check the existence of the current IOLoop before raising a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected logic, the function will properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop before raising a `RuntimeError`. This fix will address the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
