The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is failing to handle the `make_current` argument properly. 

The root cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` before making a new instance current. This leads to the failing test `test_force_current` where the RuntimeError is not being raised as expected.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` before making a new instance current. If `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the test function `test_force_current` should now pass as expected.
