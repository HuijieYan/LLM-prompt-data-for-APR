The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the class `IOLoop` in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`. This method is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance and handling the `make_current` argument.

The issue is in the logic of the `initialize` method, specifically in the conditions for checking the current IOLoop instance. The `initialize` method starts with the check `if make_current is None:` which is followed by `if make_current:`. The bug occurs when `make_current=None`. In this case, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, and if it is, it calls the `make_current` method. However, if the `make_current` argument is not provided, the code should not result in an error even if the IOLoop instance already exists.

The problem arises from the fact that the original logic does not handle the case when `make_current` is `None` properly. This causes the method to incorrectly throw the `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when the current IOLoop instance is `None`, leading to the failed test and the corresponding GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling `make current=None` should be modified to only call the `make_current` method if there is no existing instance of IOLoop. If `make_current` is `None`, the method should simply exit without raising an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will first check if `make_current` is `None` and only call `self.make_current()` if there is no existing instance of IOLoop. Additionally, it will correctly raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and an instance of IOLoop already exists. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
