## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current IOLoop instance, but it currently has a conditional statement that is causing the issue.

## Error location
The potential error is in the conditional statement that checks if the current IOLoop instance is None.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is the conditional logic that does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is None and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is also None.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to fix the conditional logic to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is None and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is also None. We also need to ensure that the error message is raised at the appropriate condition.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```
