The bug in the `initialize` function is that it's not properly handling the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists, and if not, it should make the current instance. If `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The buggy function fails the test `test_force_current` because it does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. The test expects that when `make_current` is `True`, it should make the current instance of `IOLoop` and throw a `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and behave according to the expectations of the test.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The corrected version properly checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists and handles the `make_current` parameter accordingly. This version should pass the failing test.
