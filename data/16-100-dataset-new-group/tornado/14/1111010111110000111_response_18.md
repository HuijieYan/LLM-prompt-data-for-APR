After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it's clear that the issue lies with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class. The failing test is trying to force a current `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.

The cause of the bug is that within the `initialize` function, when `make_current=True`, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists." This contradicts the logic, as it should raise the error only when an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

To fix this bug, the condition where the `RuntimeError` is raised should be inverted. It should raise the error only when `IOLoop.current()` is not `None` and `make_current` is `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists") 
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will correctly raise a `RuntimeError` only when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This will resolve the failing test and the GitHub issue.
