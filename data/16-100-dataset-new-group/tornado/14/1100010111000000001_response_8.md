## Corrected Version of the Function

# corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function lies in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which is incorrect. This condition would allow `make_current` to be called even if an IOLoop already exists. The correct condition should be `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to True.

By fixing this condition, the function will correctly check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test provided.
