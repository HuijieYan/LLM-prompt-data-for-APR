#### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
- The bug in the original function is at the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:`. This condition is checking if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it proceeds to call `self.make_current()`. However, the subsequent check in the `elif` condition is also checking for the same condition, leading to a logical error.
- The failing test is attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, and then it verifies that the current IOLoop instance has been set correctly. It then tries to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` again, and expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
- The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised prematurely, indicating that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not working as intended.
- The GitHub issue also points out the confusion about the condition at `line 252` and whether it should raise an error.

Fix:
- In the corrected version, the `elif` condition is changed to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`. This ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if the current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True` is specified. 

The corrected version addresses the logical error in the original function and should now pass the failing test.
