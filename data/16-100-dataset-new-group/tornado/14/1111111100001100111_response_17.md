The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the `IOLoop` class and is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance. The issue appears to be related to the handling of the `make_current` argument and the validation of the current `IOLoop` instance.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The handling of the `make_current` argument.
2. The validation of the current `IOLoop` instance.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If this condition is met, then `self.make_current()` is called to make the current `IOLoop`. However, if `make_current` is `True`, it checks the same condition and raises a `RuntimeError` if it is also `None`, even though the condition should not be met at this point.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic around the `make_current` argument and the validation of the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if not IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist. Additionally, we have updated the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists using `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, and only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
