## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is responsible for setting the current IOLoop instance. The test function `test_force_current` checks if the IOLoop instance is correctly created and if it raises a `RuntimeError` when attempting to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.
2. The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional statement inside the `elif make_current` block.
3. The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` instead of checking if it already exists, leading to the `RuntimeError` not being raised when it should be.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional statement to correctly check if the current IOLoop instance exists when `make_current=True`.
5. The corrected version of the buggy function is provided above. The conditional statement inside the `elif make_current` block has been modified to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` before raising a `RuntimeError`. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is raised when attempting to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True.
