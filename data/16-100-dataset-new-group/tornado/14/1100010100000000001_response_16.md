## Analyze the buggy function:
The initialize function is meant to set the current IOLoop instance, but it has some errors that need to be fixed.

## Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` is not checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance properly.
2. The use of `self.make_current()` without proper validation.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance and the improper use of `self.make_current()`.

## Strategy to fix the bug:
The bug can be fixed by checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance using a different condition and handling the calling of `self.make_current()` properly.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected function, `self.current()` is used to set the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is None, and the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance is also corrected in the `elif` block. Additionally, the use of `self.make_current()` is updated as well.
