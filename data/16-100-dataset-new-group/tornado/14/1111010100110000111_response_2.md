## The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The issue on GitHub highlights that at line 252, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. This contradicts the logic in the `initialize` function, which leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised improperly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. It should not raise a `RuntimeError` in that case.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ...
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic in the `initialize` function has been modified to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. It now raises a `RuntimeError` only if the current `IOLoop` already exists and `make_current` is `True`.
