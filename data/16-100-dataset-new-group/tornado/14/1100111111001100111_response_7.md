## Correction

**Analysis:**
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance and set it as the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist. However, there are issues with the logic of checking for the current IOLoop and making it current. This is causing the test `test_force_current` to fail, as it expects a specific behavior that is not being achieved due to the buggy function's logic.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should first check if the current IOLoop instance exists. If it doesn't, then it should make the current instance. The current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the failing test.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
- Check if `make_current` is `True`. If it is, then check if the current IOLoop instance exists. If it doesn't, make the current instance. If it does, raise the RuntimeError.
- If `make_current` is not provided, then make the current IOLoop instance only if it does not already exist.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With the above correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the scenarios related to making the current IOLoop instance.

This correction addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post and ensures that the failing test `test_force_current` will pass.
