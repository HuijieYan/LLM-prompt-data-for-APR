One potential issue is that the `make_current` attribute in the `initialize` function is being handled incorrectly, leading to a RuntimeError. It seems that the `make_current` attribute should be used to control the behavior of the IOLoop initialization, but the logic in the `initialize` function is not handling it properly.

The bug appears to be in the conditional check when `make_current` is set. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should be changed to `if IOLoop.current() is not None:` to properly check whether a current IOLoop instance exists.

Additionally, it seems that the logic for making the IOLoop current is not handled correctly using `self.make_current()`. This should be modified to `IOLoop.current(instance=True)` for the first condition and removed from the second condition.

Based on this analysis, the buggy function can be updated as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    ... (other parts remain unchanged) ...
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                IOLoop.current(instance=True)
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should properly handle the `make_current` attribute and resolve the RuntimeError issue when executing the failing test function.
