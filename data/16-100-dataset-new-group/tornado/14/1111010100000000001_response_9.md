The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a potential error in its logic. The purpose of the `initialize` function is to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and check if it needs to become the current `IOLoop`.

The potential error in the function is in the `if make_current is None` block. It tries to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not checking for the absence of a current `IOLoop` instance as expected.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect logic in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. The `instance=False` argument passed to `IOLoop.current()` is not valid and the condition will not work as intended.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the absence of a current `IOLoop` instance should be changed.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(make_current=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(make_current=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the call to `IOLoop.current(make_current=False)` correctly checks for the absence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is None. Similarly, it checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is True.
