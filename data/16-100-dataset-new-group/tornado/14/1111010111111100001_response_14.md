The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current IOLoop instance if `make_current` is `True` and verify if a current IOLoop instance already exists. However, there is a bug in the logic when setting the current instance that causes the failing test to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True`.

The bug occurs because the `initialize` function doesn't correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists. Instead of simply raising an error when a current instance already exists, the function first checks if a current instance exists and then attempts to set it as the current instance again, resulting in the `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists. Specifically, if `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, the function should immediately raise a `RuntimeError` without attempting to set the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, preventing the `RuntimeError` from occurring.
