The buggy function `initialize` has the potential error in the logic of the `if` condition where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. This logic can lead to unexpected behavior during initialization.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not handling the `make_current` argument properly. When `make_current` is not provided, it checks if the current instance exists by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. However, the logic inside the `if` condition is not clear and can lead to unexpected behavior. When `make_current` is provided and is True, it also checks if the current instance exists, and then tries to make the current `IOLoop` in both cases, leading to redundant checks and potential errors.

To fix the bug, I suggest refactoring the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` argument more clearly and efficiently. The logic for checking the current instance and making it current should be simplified and made more explicit so that it's easier to understand and maintain.

Here's a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if not current_instance:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `make_current` argument is handled more explicitly. When `make_current` is True, it checks if the current instance exists and raises an error if it does. If not, it makes the current instance. When `make_current` is False, it checks if the current instance does not exist and then makes the current instance if that's the case. This refactoring makes the logic clearer and reduces redundancy.
