After analyzing the buggy function, failing test, error message, and the GitHub issue, it is evident that the issue is with the `initialize` function in the `ioloop.py` file. The problem occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the `IOLoop` already exists. The `initialize` function is not handling this scenario correctly, leading to the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the `IOLoop` already exists. The corrected version of the function should first check if the `IOLoop` already exists before deciding whether to make it current.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function now first checks if the `IOLoop` already exists before making it current. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test `test_force_current` passes successfully without raising the `RuntimeError`.
