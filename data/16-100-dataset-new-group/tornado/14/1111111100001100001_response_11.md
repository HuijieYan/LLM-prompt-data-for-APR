The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. This method takes a parameter `make_current` which determines whether the IOLoop instance should become the current instance.

The potential error in the function lies in the conditional statements. In the first conditional block, when `make_current` is not provided, the function checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance, and if not, it calls the `make_current` method. In the second conditional block, if `make_current` is provided as `True`, it checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the first conditional block has a check for `make_current` being `None` but there is no check for `make_current` being `False`.

To fix the bug, we should add a condition in the first block to handle the case when `make_current` is `False` and also add a condition to handle the case when a current IOLoop instance already exists in the second block.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:
        # Do nothing if make_current is False
        pass
    else:
        raise ValueError("make_current should be a boolean value")
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case when `make_current` is `False` by adding an `elif` block, and we also add a catch-all `else` block to raise a `ValueError` if `make_current` is neither `None` nor `True` nor `False`.
