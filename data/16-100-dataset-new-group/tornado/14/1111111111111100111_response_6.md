To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. In this case, the code should not raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance and current_instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This fix checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a valid instance and if it's not the same instance as the current `IOLoop`. If both conditions are true, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when an actual existing instance is found.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
