The buggy function is the 'initialize' function within the 'tornado/ioloop.py' file. The failing test is the 'test_force_current' within the 'tornado/test/ioloop_test.py' file, and the corresponding error message is a RuntimeError that is raised due to the 'current IOLoop already exists'.

The potential error location within the buggy function is that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop exists is not correctly handled when 'make_current=True'.

The cause of the bug is that when the 'make_current' parameter is set to True, the code should check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. However, the current implementation of the 'initialize' function does not handle this case correctly, leading to the RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when 'make_current=True', the code correctly checks if the current IOLoop already exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the 'initialize' function will correctly handle the case where 'make_current=True', and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
