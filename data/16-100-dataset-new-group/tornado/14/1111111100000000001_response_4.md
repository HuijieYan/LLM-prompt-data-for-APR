The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class and is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance. The function takes an argument `make_current` which, if not provided, checks if there is a current instance of `IOLoop` and makes the current instance if it's not. If `make_current` is provided and is `True`, it checks if a current instance exists and raises an error if it does, otherwise it makes the current instance.

The potential error in the function is in the `initialize` method's conditional statements. The `if make_current is None` statement does not correctly check for the existence of a current instance, and the `elif make_current` statement should check if the current instance exists and not just the value of `make_current`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are not properly checking for the existence of a current instance based on the value of `make_current`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements to explicitly check for the existence of a current instance and ensure that the logic for making the current instance is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance in the variable `current_instance`. Then, we modify the conditional statements to properly check for the existence of the current instance and make the current instance based on the value of `make_current`.
