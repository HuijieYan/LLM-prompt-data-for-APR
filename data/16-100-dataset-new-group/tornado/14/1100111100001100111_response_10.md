The bug in the provided function is related to the conditional logic in the `initialize` method, specifically with the `make_current` parameter. The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly, which does not match the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

The issue indicates that there is confusion about the behavior of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returning `None` and the subsequent handling of the `make_current` parameter. This suggests that the bug may be related to the conditional checks and the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

The strategy for fixing the bug should involve revisiting the conditional logic in the `initialize` method, clarifying the behavior of the `make_current` parameter, and ensuring that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.

To resolve the bug, the `initialize` function should be updated as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the conditional logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is adjusted to properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
