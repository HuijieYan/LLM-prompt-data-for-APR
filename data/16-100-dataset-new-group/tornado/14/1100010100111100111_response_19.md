## Analysis
The `initialize` function is called with the parameter `make_current` set to `True`. Inside the function, it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and if it does, it raises a RuntimeError. However, in this case, the code is raising the RuntimeError even when the IOLoop instance does not exist.

The GitHub issue also points out the discrepancy in the behavior of the code, indicating that the check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance is not functioning as expected.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The code should only raise a RuntimeError when `make_current` is True and there is already an existing IOLoop instance. However, it is currently raising the RuntimeError regardless of whether the IOLoop instance exists or not.

## Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True. Specifically, it should raise a RuntimeError only if `make_current` is True and there is already an existing IOLoop instance.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
1. We store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the variable `current_instance` to avoid redundant calls.
2. We modify the conditional checks to correctly determine whether to make the current instance or raise a RuntimeError based on the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
