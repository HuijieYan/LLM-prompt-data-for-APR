The buggy function `initialize` checks the value of the `make_current` parameter and calls `IOLoop.current` and `self.make_current` accordingly. The bug is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current` is not `None`.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` inside the `initialize` function is incorrectly checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop`, and it's not handling the case where a current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check for the opposite case: `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` when `make_current` is `True`, and remove the redundant check for `None` when `make_current` is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the condition checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True`, and removes the unnecessary check when `make_current` is not provided. This should resolve the `RuntimeError` and pass the failing test.
