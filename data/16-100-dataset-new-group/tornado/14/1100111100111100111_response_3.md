## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The if statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might not be evaluating as expected.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter could be incorrect.

## Cause of the bug
The buggy function `initialize` checks if an IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one. However, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not functioning as expected, leading to the incorrect raising of a RuntimeError.

The related function `IOLoop.current` and the parameter `make_current` are not being utilized properly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Use the `make_current` parameter to check if a new IOLoop instance needs to be created.
2. Ensure the `IOLoop.current` function is used correctly to determine if an instance already exists.
3. Modify the condition based on the behavior expected from the `IOLoop.current` function.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By adjusting the condition and the logic inside the `initialize` function, we can address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, and ensure that the `make_current` parameter and the `IOLoop.current` function are used correctly. This corrected version should resolve the failing test and the GitHub issue.
