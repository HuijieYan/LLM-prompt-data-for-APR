### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The function is intended to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and, if not, create one. However, the bug causes an incorrect behavior when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The error message indicates that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when it should not be doing so.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the conditional check for `make_current` within the `initialize` function. It seems that the code is incorrectly raising the `RuntimeError` even when an `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug appears to be a logic error in the conditional checks within the `initialize` function. This error leads to the premature raising of the `RuntimeError`, even when it is not necessary.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional checks for `make_current` need to be revised to accurately determine whether an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This will involve correcting the logic that leads to raising the `RuntimeError` when it's not appropriate.

### Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the provided corrected version, the function should now accurately determine the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and handle the `make_current` flag appropriately. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
