The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class in `tornado/ioloop.py` is intended to set up the IOLoop instance. The problem arises because when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, the function checks if an IOLoop instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If an instance does not exist, it then calls `self.make_current()`, but if an instance does exist, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

The issue is that the code erroneously checks for whether an IOLoop instance does not exist, but the error message claims that an IOLoop instance already exists. This is a contradiction.

To resolve this issue, we should directly check if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if it does, then raise an error. The correct condition should be reversed from the current logic.

The corrected version of the `initialize` function is as follows:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this change, the `initialize` function correctly checks for the presence of an IOLoop instance and raises an error if one already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. This updated logic should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as intended.
