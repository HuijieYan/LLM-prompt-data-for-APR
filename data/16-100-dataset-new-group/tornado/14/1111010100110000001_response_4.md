The buggy function within the `IOLoop` class is `initialize`. The code as it stands is attempting to determine whether a current instance of `IOLoop` exists and whether to make the current instance based on the `make_current` argument.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements that check whether `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and the conditional that raises a `RuntimeError` if the current instance already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the condition to check if the current instance already exists is inverted, leading to the incorrect behavior. The error message provides clear insight into the issue, stating that a `RuntimeError` is raised because the current `IOLoop` already exists.

To fix the bug, reverse the logic in the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the current instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (remainder of the class remains unchanged)

    # Corrected initialize function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version checks whether the current instance exists, and if it does, makes it the current instance only when `make_current` is `None`. If `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.
