Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is causing confusion because it is checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and then raising an error if it doesn't exist.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the if-else conditions. The function should only raise the "current IOLoop already exists" error if `make_current=True` and there is already an existing IOLoop instance. However, the current implementation is not properly handling this logic.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the logic within the if-else conditions to properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already an existing IOLoop instance. It should only raise an error in that specific case.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
