The bug in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised, even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditions to check for an existing `IOLoop` instance are incorrect. The `if make_current is None` block incorrectly checks if the non-instance current IOLoop is `None` and calls `self.make_current()` if it is, which is not the intended behavior. The `elif make_current` block then also incorrectly checks if the non-instance current IOLoop is `None`, causing the `RuntimeError` to always be raised even when no current `IOLoop` exists.

To fix this bug, the conditions in the `initialize` method need to be adjusted so that `make_current` is correctly checked to determine whether a new IOLoop should be made current. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version first checks if `make_current` is `None` and then captures the current non-instance IOLoop in a variable. If it's `None`, then `self.make_current()` is called. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the non-instance current IOLoop is not `None` before raising the `RuntimeError` and making the current IOLoop. This corrected version appropriately addresses the conditions required for setting the current IOLoop.
