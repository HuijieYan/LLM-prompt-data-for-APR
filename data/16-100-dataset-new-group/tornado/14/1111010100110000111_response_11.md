### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `initialize` function checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` but raises an error if it's already existing, without handling the case where it's `None`.

### Explanation of the bug and its cause:
The buggy function's `initialize` method is designed to check if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` based on the `make_current` argument. However, it does not properly handle the case where the current instance is `None`. Instead, it directly raises an error if the current instance is `None`.

The error message from the failing test demonstrates this issue by trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current` set to `True`, leading to the erroneous behavior where the check for existing instance fails and directly raises a `RuntimeError`.


### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the `initialize` method to properly handle the case when the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`. This can be achieved through a conditional check and appropriate error handling.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                # Handle case where current instance exists
                pass
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the `initialize` function checks if the current instance is `None` and takes appropriate action based on the `make_current` argument. If the current instance exists, it is handled without raising an error. If `make_current` is `True`, then the function will correctly check for the existence of the current instance before attempting to make a new `IOLoop` instance the current one.
