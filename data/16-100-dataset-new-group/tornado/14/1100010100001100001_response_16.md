### Potential error locations
1. The condition `if make_current is None` might not be evaluating as expected
2. The condition `if make_current` might not be evaluating as expected
3. The function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` might be returning unexpected values

### Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the conditions not evaluating as expected, leading to the incorrect logic being executed.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
It seems that the conditions for checking the value of `make_current` are not working as intended. It's also possible that the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not returning the expected value. To fix this, we need to ensure that the conditions are evaluated correctly and the function call returns the expected value.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
