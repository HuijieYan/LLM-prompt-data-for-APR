The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class. It takes an optional argument `make_current` which, if set to `True`, makes the new `IOLoop` instance the current `IOLoop`, and if set to `None`, it becomes the current `IOLoop` only if no `IOLoop` is currently set as the current one.

The bug in the current implementation is that it does not correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `None`.

The bug occurs because in the `initialize` function, if `make_current` is None, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If there is no current `IOLoop`, it is supposed to call `self.make_current()` to make the new instance the current `IOLoop`. However, if there is a current `IOLoop`, it does not do anything, which is incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to change the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `None`. In this case, it should make the new instance the current `IOLoop` regardless of whether there is already a current `IOLoop` or not.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()  # Always make the new instance the current IOLoop
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, when `make_current` is `None`, the new instance will always be made the current `IOLoop`, regardless of the current state.
