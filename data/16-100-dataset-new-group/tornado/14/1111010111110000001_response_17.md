The buggy function in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization process for the IOLoop instance, including making it the current IOLoop if specified. However, the bug arises when trying to make a current IOLoop instance, leading to the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists". 

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect logic used in the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is set to `True`, instead of checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance, it directly raises an error if it does not exist. This is contrary to the intended behavior, as the purpose should be to only raise an error when the IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` method should be updated to correctly handle the scenario when `make_current` is set to `True`. It should first check if a current IOLoop instance already exists. If it exists, then it should raise the RuntimeError. Otherwise, it should make the IOLoop instance the current one.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method now correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and ensures that the current IOLoop instance is appropriately managed. The corrected version should pass the failing test.
