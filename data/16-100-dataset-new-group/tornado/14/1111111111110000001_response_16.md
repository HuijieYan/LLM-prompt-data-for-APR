The buggy function `initialize` from the class `IOLoop` in the file `tornado/ioloop.py` has a bug that leads to the failing test `test_force_current` in the test file `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`.

The function `initialize` is supposed to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class, and if `make_current` is true, it should set this instance as the current `IOLoop` instance. The failing test `test_force_current` initializes an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then checks whether this instance is the current instance, and further checks if a second initialization with `make_current=True` throws a `RuntimeError`.

The error message suggests that the second initialization raised a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This indicates that the failed construction due to a pre-existing current instance was unsuccessful.

The buggy part of the function is the logic inside the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The `if-elif` condition to handle the `make_current` argument is not working as intended. When `make_current` is true, it should check if a current instance already exists and raise an error if one does. However, the current implementation results in this condition not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and check for the existence of current instances.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method with the bug fixed:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In the fixed version, we modified the `if-elif` condition to correctly check for the existence of a current instance and raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is true and a current instance already exists. We also call `self.make_current()` based on the corrected logic.

With these changes, the fixed function should pass the failing test and handle the `make_current` argument according to the intended behavior.
