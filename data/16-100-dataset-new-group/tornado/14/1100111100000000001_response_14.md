## Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class and is responsible for initializing the IOLoop. It takes an argument `make_current` which defaults to `None`.

## Error location
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` might not be working as intended.
2. The condition `elif make_current:` might not be handling the cases properly.

## Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the conditions in the `initialize` function are not properly handling the cases where `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or `False`. This can lead to incorrect initialization of the IOLoop.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to rewrite the conditions in the `initialize` function to handle the cases when `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or `False` properly. By doing so, we can ensure that the IOLoop is initialized correctly based on the value of `make_current`.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current:
                if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
                self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version:
- We removed the `elif` and used `else` instead to handle the cases where `make_current` is not `None`.
- We also moved the check for `make_current` inside the `else` block to properly handle the different cases.
