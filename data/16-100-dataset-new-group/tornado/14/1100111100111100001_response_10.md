The issue in the buggy function is that it is not properly checking whether the current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make it the current one. This results in a RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for checking the current IOLoop is correct and that the RuntimeError is only raised when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other functions from the same class

    # The corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                if current_instance is not self:
                    self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None and current_instance is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first retrieve the current IOLoop instance and then perform the necessary checks to determine whether to make the current instance or raise a RuntimeError. This ensures that the function behaves as intended and that the failing test will now pass.
