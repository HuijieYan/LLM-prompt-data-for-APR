The bug in the `initialize` function is that it checks for the existence of a current IOLoop using the `current` method of the class `IOLoop`. However, there is also a global `current` function defined outside the `IOLoop` class, and it seems to be incorrectly called within the `initialize` method. This global `current` function is not intended to be used in this context.

To fix this bug, we should explicitly call the `current` method of the `IOLoop` instance within the `initialize` method instead of using the global function.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # Call the current method of the IOLoop instance
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Call the current method of the IOLoop instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass.
