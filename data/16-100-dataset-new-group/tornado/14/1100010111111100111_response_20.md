## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        return
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that the logic for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists is incorrect. When `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists, the function should raise a RuntimeError. But the original implementation was not performing this check correctly, resulting in the failing test.

The corrected version of the function checks correctly for the existence of an IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one. If `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists, it raises a RuntimeError as expected. If `make_current` is None, and an IOLoop instance does not exist, it creates a new one.

By modifying the logical conditions and checks in the function, the corrected version ensures that the behavior aligns with the expectations of the tests and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

After applying the corrections, re-run the failing test to ensure that the corrected function passes the test successfully.
