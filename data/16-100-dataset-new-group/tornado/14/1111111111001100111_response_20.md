The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is failing the test because it doesn't initialize the `make_current` parameter correctly. The problem arises from the conditional checks within the `initialize` function, where the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance appears to be incorrect. The failing test `test_force_current` specifies the expected behavior for handling the `make_current` parameter while initializing the `IOLoop` instance.

The main issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. The conditional checks in the `initialize` function are not setting the current `IOLoop` instance appropriately. This leads to the failure in the test because the logic in the `initialize` function is not properly enforcing the behavior described in the test case.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to update the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. The conditional checks should be modified to ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is being set or checked based on the value of `make_current`.


Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks have been updated to handle the `make_current` parameter appropriately. The `make_current` parameter is now correctly used to determine whether to set the current `IOLoop` instance. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
