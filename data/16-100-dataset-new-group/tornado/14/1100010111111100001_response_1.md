### Potential Error Locations
The potential error in the code lies within the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. Specifically, the conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` combined with the `make_current` parameter seems to be causing the issue.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is set to True, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop already exists. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case, leading to the RuntimeError not being raised when it should be.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The buggy code should be modified so that if `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop already exists, the function should raise a `RuntimeError`. Additionally, the code should be structured to handle this case correctly.

### The Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

The corrected version of the `initialize` function has the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to correctly check if a current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is True. If a current IOLoop does exist, it raises a `RuntimeError`, else it proceeds with making the current IOLoop. This should resolve the issue and the test should pass.
