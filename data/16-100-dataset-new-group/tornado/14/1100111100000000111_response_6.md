To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class. The issue on GitHub suggests that there is a problem with the logic at line 252 of the `initialize` function, where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and then either raises an error or calls `self.make_current()`.

The cause of the bug is that the logic is incorrect. If `make_current` is None, it should call `self.make_current()` only if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. If `make_current` is not None, it should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None and raise an error if it is, or call `self.make_current()` if it is None.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we removed the second `elif` statement and merged it with the `else` block. This change ensures that the function correctly handles both cases and follows the logic as per the GitHub issue.

By making these changes, the buggy function should now handle the initialization of `IOLoop` instances correctly and address the issue raised on GitHub.
