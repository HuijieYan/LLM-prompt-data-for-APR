The buggy function `initialize` is checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance incorrectly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised when it shouldn't be.

The issue seems to be related to the `initialize` function incorrectly checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. This is causing the function to raise a RuntimeError even when the IOLoop instance is not already present.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional check in the `initialize` function to correctly determine whether the current IOLoop instance exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks have been adjusted to correctly handle the scenarios where the current IOLoop instance exists or not. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
