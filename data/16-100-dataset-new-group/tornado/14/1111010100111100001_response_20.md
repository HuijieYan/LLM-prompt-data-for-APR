The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` object with a flag `make_current` that defaults to `None`. If it is `None`, it will check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and make the current instance if it doesn't exist. If `make_current` is `True`, it will raise an error if there is already a current instance of the `IOLoop`.

The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` because it thinks that there is already a current `IOLoop` existing.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements within the `initialize` function to accurately check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This should fix the bug and the function should now pass the failing test.
