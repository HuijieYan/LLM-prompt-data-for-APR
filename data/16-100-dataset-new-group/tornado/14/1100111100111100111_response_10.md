The buggy function 'initialize' in the 'IOLoop' class from the file 'tornado/ioloop.py' is causing a RuntimeError when 'make_current' is set to True. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the IOLoop instance.

The problem seems to be with the conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` not correctly evaluating whether an IOLoop instance already exists. This leads to the RuntimeError being erroneously raised.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to directly check if the IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):  # Check if an IOLoop instance already exists
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):  # Check if an IOLoop instance already exists
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise an error if it does
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the creation of a new IOLoop instance and avoid raising the RuntimeError improperly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub repository.
