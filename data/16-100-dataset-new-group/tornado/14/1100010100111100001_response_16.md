The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if the `make_current` parameter is set to True. However, the bug is causing a RuntimeError to be raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists" even when the `make_current` parameter is True.

The cause of the bug is that the logic inside the `initialize` function is incorrectly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checking if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if it is, it is supposed to make the IOLoop current. However, the bug is causing it to incorrectly check if the current IOLoop instance is already None, leading to the RuntimeError being raised when it's not expected.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None when `make_current` is True and then make the IOLoop current if it's not. If `make_current` is None or False, the function should continue without making the IOLoop current.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
``` 

With this correction, the function should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and avoid raising the RuntimeError when it's not expected.
