The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class arises from the logic used to check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The issue is that even if `make_current` is True, the code is still checking if an `IOLoop` instance exists, and if it does, it raises a `RuntimeError` instead of just making the current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be re-evaluated to ensure that `make_current` is the only condition checked when determining whether to raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # existing class methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `make_current` parameter is directly checked, and if true, it verifies if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises a `RuntimeError` only if it does. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
