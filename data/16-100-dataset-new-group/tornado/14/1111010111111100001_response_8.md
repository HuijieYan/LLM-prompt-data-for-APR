The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the condition `if make_current is None:`. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should not check if it is `None` and automatically run the code within the `elif make_current` block. However, the current implementation still checks the `if make_current is None` condition, resulting in an incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we should remove the `if make_current is None` condition entirely and directly execute the code within the `elif make_current` block if `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and will pass the failing test.
