The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it checks for the current instance of the `IOLoop` even when `make_current` is set to `True`, which is not necessary. The purpose of the `make_current` argument is to explicitly specify whether the new `IOLoop` should become the current one. Therefore, the bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True` even if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` function should only check for the current instance if `make_current` is `None` or `False`, and should skip the check when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or not make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` has been removed from the `initialize` function. Now, the `make_current` argument is checked to determine if the new `IOLoop` should become the current instance, and no unnecessary checks are performed when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.
