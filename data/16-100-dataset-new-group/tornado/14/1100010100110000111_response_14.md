### Analysis:

The error message indicates that the code is trying to force the creation of a current IOLoop when it already exists, leading to a `RuntimeError`. The GitHub issue also points out that the current IOLoop is being checked for its existence, but then a "already exists" error is being raised.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if the current IOLoop is None or not.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the code should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists. However, the current implementation is not respecting this logic and is raising the error even when `make_current` is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition to check the existence of the current IOLoop only when `make_current` is `None`.
2. If `make_current` is set to `True`, then directly raise the `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop exists.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop is only evaluated when `make_current` is `None`. If `make_current` is `True`, the code directly raises a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop exists, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
