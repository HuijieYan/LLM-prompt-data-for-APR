Based on the provided information and the GitHub issue, it seems that the issue is with the logic of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class. The problem arises when `make_current` is `True`, but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, leading to the incorrect raising of a RuntimeError.

The buggy function `initialize` should handle the `make_current` argument properly and ensure that it correctly determines whether an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be employed:
1. If `make_current` is `None`, check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if so, make the current instance.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, and if not, raise a RuntimeError. Otherwise, make the current instance.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version addresses the issue reported on GitHub by fixing the logic for determining whether an `IOLoop` instance already exists and handling the `make_current` argument accordingly.
