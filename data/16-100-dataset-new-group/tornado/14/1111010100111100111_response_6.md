The issue in the buggy function is related to the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but it's raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". The problem seems to be caused by the logic in the `initialize` method.

The cause of the bug:
1. The `initialize` method first checks if the `make_current` parameter is None, and if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, it calls `self.make_current()`.
2. If `make_current` is not None, it then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is also None before calling `self.make_current()`. If it's not None, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".
3. The issue in the failing test occurs when `make_current=True`. The logic should not be checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None before making it the current one, as the intention is to forcefully make the current instance without checking for its existence.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Remove the check for the current instance being None when `make_current=True` and proceed with making the current instance regardless of its existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
By removing the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is None before making it the current one, the corrected version ensures that when `make_current=True`, the current instance will be forcefully made without checking for its existence.
