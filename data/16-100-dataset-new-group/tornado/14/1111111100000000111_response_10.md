The buggy function is the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The function checks whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, it either creates a new current instance or raises a RuntimeError if one already exists.

The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are:

1. Line 8: The check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might be incorrect based on the reported issue in the GitHub post. The issue suggests that the current instance is being checked as None, but then the function raises "current IOLoop already exists".

The cause of the bug is that the function uses `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check for an existing current instance, but it doesn't handle the case when the current instance exists properly. This does not align with the expectations based on the GitHub issue.

A strategy for fixing this bug would be to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case when the current instance exists properly and not raise an error in that case. Additionally, the condition for checking whether `make_current` argument is None should be handled appropriately.

One possible correction for the bug could be to update the `initialize` function as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance in the `current_instance` variable, and then we use this variable to check if the current instance exists or not. Also, we handle the condition for the `make_current` argument appropriately and raise an error only if a current instance exists and `make_current` is True.
