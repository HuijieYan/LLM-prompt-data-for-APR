The buggy function is the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The purpose of this function is to initialize the `IOLoop` object, and if `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current `IOLoop` instance.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, which leads to a `RuntimeError` being raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

The potential error location is within the `if make_current` block of the `initialize` method.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the code should be checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before setting the current instance, but the current logic checks if it is not `None`, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to change the condition in the `if make_current` block to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before setting the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other methods and functions remain the same

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
