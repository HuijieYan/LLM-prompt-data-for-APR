The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the bug in this function causes the test `test_force_current` to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. It should make the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist, but it is not doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected version of initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass.
