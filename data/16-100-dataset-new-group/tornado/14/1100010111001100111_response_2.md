## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` and set it as the current instance if `make_current` is True. If `make_current` is not specified, it should only make the current instance if no current instance already exists. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and then assert that it raises a `RuntimeError` since a current instance already exists.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error in the buggy function lies within the condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the improper handling of conditions to check the existence of the current `IOLoop`. The function does not correctly determine whether a current instance exists, leading to the incorrect flow of control within the conditional statements.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should explicitly check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to make it the current instance. If `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, it should raise the `RuntimeError` as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the current instance is explicitly checked before making it the current instance or raising the `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True`. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test `test_force_current` passes.
