Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is related to the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly even when the `make_current` parameter is `True`.

### Analysis
The bug seems to be in the condition where it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should only raise the `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance needs to be modified. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `initialize` function to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, the corrected version ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

This should address the bug and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
