The problem with the buggy function is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. In this method, when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does.

The issue is that when `make_current` is `True`, it should not be checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists but should always make the current instance.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to always make the current instance when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will always make the current instance when `make_current` is `True`, ensuring that the current instance is created regardless of its existence.

This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
