The buggy function is the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class. This function is designed to initialize the IOLoop and set it as the current IOLoop if necessary. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditionals that determine whether to make the IOLoop current and the logic for checking if there is already a current IOLoop.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic does not handle the case where `make_current` is `False`, but there is already a current IOLoop. Additionally, the `make_current()` method is being called without being defined in the provided code.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks and add the `make_current()` method to the class.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In this corrected version, we have added an `else` statement to handle the case where `make_current` is `False`. We also assume that the `make_current()` method is defined elsewhere in the `IOLoop` class. If it is not defined, it needs to be implemented accordingly.
