### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is set to `True`. The function checks if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if it doesn't, it attempts to make the current IOLoop. However, if the current IOLoop instance already exists, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that "current IOLoop already exists". This behavior contradicts the condition and leads to the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should only attempt to make the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist. If it does exist, it should not raise an error but continue executing the rest of the function. The logic needs to be corrected to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Removed redundant elif condition
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

### Explanation:
The corrected function includes a simplified logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. It first checks if the current IOLoop does not exist, and if so, it creates the current IOLoop. If the IOLoop does exist, it simply continues execution without raising an error.

This corrected function aligns with the expected behavior and should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
