In the buggy function, the issue seems to be related to the logic of checking the current instance of IOLoop. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance and check whether it already exists before making it the current instance.

It appears that the bug lies in the conditional checks within the initialize function. Specifically, the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance is flawed.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks do not accurately determine whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not. This results in the incorrect behavior of either raising a "current IOLoop already exists" error when it should not or failing to initialize the IOLoop instance when it should.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic of the conditional checks to accurately determine whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the second conditional check has been modified to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None before raising the "already exists" error. This should fix the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
