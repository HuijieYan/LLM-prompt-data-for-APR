### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado` library is failing the test `test_force_current` in the file `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised even when the `IOLoop.current()` is None.

The GitHub issue also points to the same problem, questioning the logic at line 252 of `ioloop.py` where `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` results in the `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is within the `if` condition for `make_current` at line 252 of `ioloop.py`.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not behaving as expected. It is raising a `RuntimeError` even when the `IOLoop.current()` is None, which does not align with the intended behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `initialize` function only raises a `RuntimeError` when the `IOLoop.current()` is not None and `make_current` is True.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` has been updated to properly check if the current IOLoop already exists before raising a `RuntimeError`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the `test_force_current` pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
