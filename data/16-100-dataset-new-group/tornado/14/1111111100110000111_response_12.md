### Analysis
The `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop, and it takes an argument `make_current`. The bug causes a RuntimeError to be raised when `make_current` is set to `True`, even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This is the root cause of the bug.

The class `IOLoop` as also contains the `current` and `make_current` methods which are used within the `initialize` method.

The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when `make_current` is set to `True`, even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The GitHub issue titled "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" points out the inconsistency in the logic and questions why the RuntimeError is raised in that scenario.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the conditional logic of the `initialize` method, particularly in the `elif` block where `make_current` is `True`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect checking of `make_current` in the `initialize` method. It incorrectly raises a RuntimeError when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This goes against the expected behavior, leading to the bug.

### Suggested Fix
The bug can be fixed by adjusting the conditional logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. We need to modify the conditional flow to match the intended behavior.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # fixed condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By fixing the condition in the `elif` block to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, we ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when a current IOLoop already exists, as intended.
