To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we need to modify the conditional checks for the `make_current` parameter. The issue seems to be that when `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if so, raise an error. However, the original implementation is not handling this case correctly, as it raises the error even when the current instance is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if the current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The correction involves modifying the `elif make_current` block to check if the current instance is not `None` before raising the `RuntimeError`. This change will ensure that the error is only raised when there is an existing current instance of `IOLoop` and `make_current` is `True`.

By making this change, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should fix the bug and pass the failing test. This will also resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the unexpected behavior on line 252 of the `ioloop.py` file.
