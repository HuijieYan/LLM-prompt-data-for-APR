## Strategy for fixing the bug

The bug in the initialize function seems to be related to the condition checks for `make_current`. The function should check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to make it current. The bug could be fixed by adjusting the conditional statements to properly handle the different cases for `make_current`.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version above, the function properly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to make it current. It addresses the issue raised on GitHub and ensures that the function behaves as intended.
