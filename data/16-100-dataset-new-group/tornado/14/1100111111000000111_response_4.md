## Fixed Version

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the fixed function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
    
```

After analyzing the buggy function and its related functions, test code, and the GitHub issue, it was identified that the bug was in the condition for raising the RuntimeError. The bug was caused by the incorrect condition checking in the `initialize` function, specifically in the `elif make_current:` block. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should be changed to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` to properly handle the case where the current IOLoop already exists.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug was to modify the condition checking to properly handle the case where the IOLoop already exists.

The corrected version of the function is provided above. This version addresses the bug by adjusting the condition checking in the `initialize` function to correctly raise the RuntimeError when the current IOLoop already exists.
