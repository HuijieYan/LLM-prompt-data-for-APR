The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` has a logic error that is causing it to fail the test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`.

The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the logic is flawed, and it fails the test because it does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists. We can achieve this by adding a condition to check if the current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make it the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, it should pass the failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`.
