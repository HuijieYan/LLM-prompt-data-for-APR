Based on the buggy function and the related code, it seems that the issue arises from the way the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class handles the `make_current` argument. The function is intended to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if necessary. However, the bug causes a RuntimeError to be raised even when the current IOLoop already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the scenario when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists. The logic checks for the existence of the current IOLoop and tries to make the IOLoop current without checking the value of `make_current` when it is True.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic within the `initialize` function to only attempt to make the IOLoop current if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop does not already exist. Additionally, the check for the existence of the current IOLoop when `make_current` is True should be removed.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass. It ensures that making the IOLoop current is only attempted when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop does not already exist.
