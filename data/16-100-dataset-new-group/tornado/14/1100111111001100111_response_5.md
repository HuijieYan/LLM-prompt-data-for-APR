The buggy function "initialize" is intended to initialize an IOLoop instance, but it has a bug when checking for the presence of an existing IOLoop. The bug occurs in the conditional statements where it checks if "IOLoop.current" is None.

The issue on GitHub points out that the condition "IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None" is being used to check for the absence of an existing IOLoop, but the code then raises a "current IOLoop already exists" error, which is contradictory.

The problem lies in the logic of the conditional statements. When "make_current" is not provided and "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" is None, the function is supposed to call "self.make_current()" to create a new IOLoop. However, when "make_current" is provided as True and "IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None", the function should not raise an error but proceed to call "self.make_current()".

To fix this bug, we should update the conditional statements in the "initialize" function to correctly handle the cases where "make_current" is provided and where it is not.
Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions here...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the condition "if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None" is used to check for the presence of an existing IOLoop when "make_current" is True, and the error is only raised in that case. This correction aligns with the intended logic of the function and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

By making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test "test_force_current" and resolve the GitHub issue.
