### Bug Analysis
The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is failing to handle the logic for creating a new IOLoop instance when `make_current=True` is passed. This is causing the test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file to fail with a `RuntimeError`.

The failing test is trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, but the current logic in the `initialize` function is not correctly checking whether an IOLoop instance already exists.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `initialize` function is raising a `RuntimeError` because it detects that a current IOLoop already exists, even though the intention of the test was to create a new IOLoop instance and make it the current one.

Based on the GitHub issue, it seems like there is a discrepancy in the behavior of the `initialize` function when checking for the existence of the current IOLoop.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The `initialize` function should be updated to accurately check whether a current IOLoop instance already exists, and based on that information, either create a new instance or raise a `RuntimeError`. 

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:  # make_current is None or False
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

The corrected `initialize` function now properly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before deciding whether to create a new instance or raise a `RuntimeError`. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
