The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop and set it as the current IOLoop instance. However, it has a bug where it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't. 

The problematic part of the code is:
```python
if make_current is None:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
elif make_current:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```

The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, the current IOLoop is checked, and if it is `None`, a `RuntimeError` is raised. However, in the failing test, the `make_current` is being set to `True`, causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised.

To fix the bug, we should modify the code to first set the current IOLoop and then check if it already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        self.make_current()

        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this fix, the `make_current` flag is always setting the current IOLoop, and then, if it is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop already exists and raises the `RuntimeError` if necessary.

This corrected function should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
