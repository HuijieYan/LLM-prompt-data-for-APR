### Potential Error Locations
1. In the `initialize` function, the condition for checking if `make_current` is `None` or `True` can be a potential error location.
2. The `make_current` function itself might not be handling the current IOLoop instance correctly, leading to the "already exists" error.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the `initialize` function not correctly handling the existing IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. This results in the RuntimeError being raised when a new IOLoop instance is created with `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should first check if the IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. If an existing IOLoop instance is found, it should not raise the RuntimeError and should handle the situation appropriately.

### The Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and current_instance:
            # Do not raise an error if make_current is True and an instance already exists
            return
        elif make_current and not current_instance:
            self.make_current()
```
