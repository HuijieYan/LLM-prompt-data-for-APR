## Analyze the buggy function:
The initialize function is taking an argument make_current and if it is None, it checks if there is no current IOLoop and then calls self.make_current(). If make_current is True, it checks if there is no current IOLoop and then raises an exception. 

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error could occur when make_current is True and there is already a current IOLoop, as it should not raise an exception in this case.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The bug occurs when make_current is True and there is already a current IOLoop, the function incorrectly raises a RuntimeError.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by updating the logic to only raise an exception if make_current is True and there is no current IOLoop.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
