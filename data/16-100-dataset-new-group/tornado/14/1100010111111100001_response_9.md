The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists. The function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when `make_current=True` even though the IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` inside the `initialize` function needs to be modified. It should check if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists, then raise the RuntimeError.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the IOLoop already exists, and the failing test should pass.
