The potential error in the buggy function is the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. The bug causes the failing test to raise a RuntimeError when `make_current` is set to True, even though the current IOLoop does not exist.

The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect. It should actually be checking if the current IOLoop exists, and if not, then it should raise a RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if not, then proceed with making the current IOLoop instance. Also, we should check if `make_current` is set to True, and if so, raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test should now pass and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
