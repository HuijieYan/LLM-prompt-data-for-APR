The buggy function `initialize` is failing to set the current `IOLoop` instance correctly when `make_current` is set to `True`. 

The cause of the bug is that in the `initialize` function, the condition `if make_current is None:` always evaluates to `False` when `make_current` is `True`, which leads to the `elif` block being executed, resulting in the wrong behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and set the current `IOLoop` instance accordingly.
