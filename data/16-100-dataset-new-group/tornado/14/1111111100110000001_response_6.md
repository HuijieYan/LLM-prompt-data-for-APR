The cause of the error is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The `make_current` parameter is supposed to be used to control whether the new `IOLoop` instance becomes the current instance, and the `initialize` method is supposed to make the new instance the current one if `make_current` is `True`. However, the logic in the `initialize` method is incorrect and results in the RuntimeError: "current IOLoop already exists".

The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the make_current flag changes the current instance only when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=True):  # Default make_current to True
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code:
- The `initialize` method now defaults `make_current` to `True`, so it will try to replace the existing current instance by default.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if an IOLoop instance is already the current one. If yes, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If no, it sets the current instance as the new instance.
