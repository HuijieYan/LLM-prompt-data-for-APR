## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance and make it the current instance if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the function is not correctly checking the current instance and raising a `RuntimeError` when it should.

## Identified Potential Error:
The potential error in the `initialize` function is in the conditional checks and the use of `make_current`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter and not raising a `RuntimeError` when a second `make_current=True` construction is attempted.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `make_current` is set to `True`, and if the current IOLoop instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. If `make_current` is not provided, then make the current instance only if it does not already exist.
3. Also, update the logic to ensure that the IOLoop instance is made current only when necessary.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# Corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the corrected `initialize` function, it should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and pass the failing test.
