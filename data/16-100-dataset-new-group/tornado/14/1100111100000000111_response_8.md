## A corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the initialize function occurs when checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The issue arises from the incorrect logic used to determine whether the current IOLoop already exists or not. The bug causes the RuntimeError to be raised even when the current IOLoop instance is None.

To fix the bug, the logic in the if statement needs to be updated. The condition for checking if the current IOLoop exists or not needs to be reversed. Additionally, the elif statement can be replaced with else since make_current is a boolean value.

By correcting the logic in the if statement and using else instead of elif, we can avoid the incorrect RuntimeError being raised when the current IOLoop is None.

The corrected version of the function above resolves these issues and provides the expected behavior according to the GitHub issue.
