## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, the GitHub issue

The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance and making it the current instance if `make_current` is set to `True`. The issue on GitHub points out that there is a discrepancy in the logic of the function and questions the behavior when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` but still raises "current IOLoop already exists".

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error in the function lies in the logic used to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and whether to make the current instance.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the GitHub Issue information

The cause of the bug is the inconsistent logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `None`, the function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and if it is, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is set to `True`, it again checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and if it is not, it raises a RuntimeError without attempting to make it the current instance.

The GitHub issue points out this inconsistency and questions why the RuntimeError is raised in this scenario.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be revised. If `make_current` is `None`, it should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and if it is not, it should call `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it should simply call `self.make_current()` without checking for the existence of the current instance.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class members)

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the corrected version, the logic is modified to first check if `make_current` is `None` or `True`. If it is, then it checks if the current instance is `None` and makes it the current instance if it is. If `make_current` is `False`, it doesn't attempt to make it the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it raises a RuntimeError only if the current instance already exists.
