The buggy function is the `initialize` method in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The error occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and there is already an existing IOLoop instance.

The cause of the bug is that the condition for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists is incorrect. The aim is to prevent creating a new IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to `True`, and there is already an existing IOLoop instance. However, the current condition does not achieve this goal.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True` should be modified to prevent creating a new IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the condition for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True` is properly updated to prevent creating a new IOLoop instance when one already exists.
