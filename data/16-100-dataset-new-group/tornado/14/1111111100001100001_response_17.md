The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` object with the `make_current` parameter. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, as it should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` already exists, but it does not do so.

The cause of the bug is that the `if` statement checks if `make_current` is `None`, but it should also check if `make_current` is `True`. If it is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `if` statement to include a check for `make_current == True` and raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current == True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
