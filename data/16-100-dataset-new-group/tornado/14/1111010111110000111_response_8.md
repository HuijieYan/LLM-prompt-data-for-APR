The potential error location within the `initialize` function is at the `elif make_current` block where it raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

The cause of the bug is that line 252 in `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` doesn't return `None` as expected, which causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised in the `initialize` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `IOLoop.current` method is returning the correct value and then conditionally handle it in the `initialize` function to avoid the `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if existing_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self = existing_instance
    elif make_current:
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if existing_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the `make_current` parameter is `None` and then retrieve the existing instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If the existing instance is not `None`, we assign it to `self`. Otherwise, we proceed to make the current instance using `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True`, we again check for the existing instance, and if it exists, we raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we make the current instance.

This corrected version should avoid the `RuntimeError` being raised and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
