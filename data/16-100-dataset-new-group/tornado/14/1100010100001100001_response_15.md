The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter when it is set to `True`. 

The function is supposed to either make the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't exist, or raise a RuntimeError if it already exists. However, the current implementation only checks if an IOLoop instance exists when `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and does not handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first store the current IOLoop instance in a variable `current_instance`. Then we check for the condition when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists. If that's the case, we raise a RuntimeError. Otherwise, we proceed to make the current IOLoop instance.
