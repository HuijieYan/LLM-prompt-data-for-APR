The bug in the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is causing the failing test in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`. The error message is indicating that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when it shouldn't be.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if it is, it raises a `RuntimeError` even though it is expected to create a new `IOLoop` instance. This behavior is causing the failing test and is also reported in the GitHub issue titled "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" where the user is questioning why a `RuntimeError` is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to always create a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will create a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and the failing test should pass. This change addresses the reported GitHub issue and resolves the bug.
