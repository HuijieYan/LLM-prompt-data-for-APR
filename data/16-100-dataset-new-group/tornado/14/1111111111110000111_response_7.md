The issue in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it is not correctly checking the current instance when trying to make it the current one. The bug causes the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error during the test.

To fix this bug, a correction can be made to ensure that if the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If it does exist, it should not attempt to make the current instance and raise an error immediately. The corrected version should handle this condition properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

In this corrected version, when `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If it does exist, it raises the `RuntimeError` immediately. Otherwise, it makes the current instance. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
