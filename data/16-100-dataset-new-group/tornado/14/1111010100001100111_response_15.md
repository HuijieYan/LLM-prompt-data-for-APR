## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`. It is designed to initialize the IOLoop and potentially make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to True. The bug seems to be related to the logic around checking the current IOLoop instance and making it the current one.

The GitHub issue indicates that there is a problem on line 252, where `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` but still raises "already exists". This suggests that the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance is incorrect.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and the current IOLoop instance.
2. The call to `self.make_current()`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by a logical error in the conditional statements that check the current IOLoop instance. It is likely that the logic is not correctly handling the cases where `make_current` is True or None and how it interacts with the current IOLoop instance.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the conditional statements need to be modified to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is True, False, or None, and interact with the current IOLoop instance appropriately. Additionally, the logic around making the IOLoop current may need to be adjusted.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance of IOLoop and then use that variable to make decisions about making the IOLoop current or raising an error. We also handle the case where `make_current` is None and the current instance is not None appropriately.
