The buggy function `initialize` in the IOLoop class is causing the test `test_force_current` to fail. 

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` might not be handling the case where `make_current` is True as intended.
2. The condition `elif make_current:` might not be correctly handling the case where `make_current` is True.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function `initialize` does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. The failing test is trying to initialize an IOLoop with `make_current=True`, but the current implementation of the `initialize` function does not properly handle this case.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to ensure that the `initialize` function correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and makes the IOLoop object current when `make_current` is True.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the corrected version, we handle both the cases of `make_current is None` and `make_current is True` within the same `if` condition and ensure that the IOLoop is made current when necessary. This should resolve the failing test and the GitHub issue.
