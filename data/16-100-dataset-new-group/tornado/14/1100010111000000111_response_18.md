## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The cause of the bug is that the original `initialize` function did not correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the check for the current IOLoop instance. This resulted in the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly. The bug was reported in the GitHub issue as well.

To fix the bug, I added a line to store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance`. Then, I modified the if conditions to correctly check the value of `current_instance` and handle the `make_current` argument accordingly.

With the corrected version of the function, the check for `current_instance` is performed correctly and the RuntimeError is only raised when a current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is True, which aligns with the expected behavior.

The corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
