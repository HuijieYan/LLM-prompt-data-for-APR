The bug in the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop exists is incorrect. The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly, leading to the failing test.

The issue in the `initialize` function is with the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is `None` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, then `make_current` should be called to set the current IOLoop. If `make_current` is `True`, then it should also check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is already set before making the current IOLoop.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The key changes in the corrected version are:
- In the second condition, check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` before raising `RuntimeError`.
  
With these changes, the `initialize` function should work correctly and pass the failing test.
