## Improper initialization condition

The `initialize` function is designed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` class with the option to make it the current `IOLoop`. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument to the `initialize` function. This should result in a check to determine if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. However, the implementation is incorrect because it raises a `RuntimeError` regardless of the current `IOLoop` instance's existence.

The source of the bug can be traced to the `initialize` function's conditional statement. When `make_current=True`, the function should check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it does, it should raise a `RuntimeError` to indicate that the current `IOLoop` already exists. However, the current implementation raises the `RuntimeError` unconditionally, leading to the failure of the provided test function.

To resolve the bug, the conditional statement in the `initialize` function needs to be corrected to check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance, and raise a `RuntimeError` only when it already exists.

## Corrected Buggy Function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the conditional check in the `initialize` function, the bug related to raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance exists is resolved. This version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
