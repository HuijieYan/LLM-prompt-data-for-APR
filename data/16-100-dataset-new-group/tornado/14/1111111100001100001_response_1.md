### Bug Explanation
The `initialize` function is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` class, and it takes an optional parameter `make_current`. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True` and the `IOLoop.current` function returns `None`, resulting in a `RuntimeError` being raised. This is not the expected behavior and does not align with the intended functionality of the function.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the conditional statement for the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current is True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, a `RuntimeError` is raised. This is not the expected behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional statement for `make_current` needs to be adjusted. When `make_current` is `True`, it should not check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, as this is not the expected behavior. Instead, it should directly call `self.make_current()` without any additional checks.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the bug is fixed and the expected behavior is achieved.
