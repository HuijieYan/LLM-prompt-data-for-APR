The bug in the code is that the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The condition for checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists is not properly executed.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    # ... other methods ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=False):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the `initialize` method to the corrected version above, it should now properly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` already exists.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass without causing a `RuntimeError` due to the incorrect check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.
