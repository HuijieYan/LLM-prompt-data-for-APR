### Analysis
The `initialize` function is intended to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is `True`. However, the error message indicates that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` because the current IOLoop already exists, even though `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is checking if the current IOLoop does not exist, but this condition should not be checked if `make_current` is `True`. Instead, the function should directly make the current IOLoop without checking.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop should be removed when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
