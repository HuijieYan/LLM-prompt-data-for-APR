# The corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

## Explanation:
The bug in the original `initialize` function is that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is incorrect. This causes the `with self.assertRaises(RuntimeError)` test to fail.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug in the code needs to be fixed by updating the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly determine if the current IOLoop already exists before calling `self.make_current()` and raising a `RuntimeError` if it does.

## Updated Corrected Version:
The corrected version of the `initialize` function above has been updated to fix the bug. Now, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists has been corrected, and the function should now pass the failing test.
