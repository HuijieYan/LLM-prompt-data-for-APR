The bug in the function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is that it checks if the current IOLoop is `None` or not before trying to make the current IOLoop. This check results in an incorrect error being raised when `make_current` is set to `True`, causing the failing test `test_force_current` to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True`, even if the current IOLoop is `None`.

To fix the bug, the function should simply try to make the current IOLoop without any conditional checks, as setting the current IOLoop should handle the case when it is `None` or already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the function will always try to make the current IOLoop when `make_current` is set to `True`, which will handle the case whether the current IOLoop is `None` or already exists.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
