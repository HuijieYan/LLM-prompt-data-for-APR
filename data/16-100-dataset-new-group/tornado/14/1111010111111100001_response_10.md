### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is not provided, or if it is set to `True`. The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current` to `True`, creates a `IOLoop` instance, and then attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current` set to `True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` because the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Bug
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The `initialize` function should only set the current `IOLoop` instance if there is no current instance, but it incorrectly tries to set the current instance in all cases.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should only attempt to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance. If `make_current` is not provided, it should also set the current instance if there is no current instance. Otherwise, it should do nothing.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
