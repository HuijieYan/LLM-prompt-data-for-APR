The bug in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists" even though the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should pass. This indicates that there is a logical error in the code that checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`, we ensure that if the current `IOLoop` exists and `make_current` is set to `True`, it will raise the `RuntimeError` as intended.

With this correction, the `initialize` method should now handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` correctly and pass the failing test.
