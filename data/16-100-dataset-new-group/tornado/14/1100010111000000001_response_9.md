## Analysis
The `initialize` function is supposed to set the current IOLoop if it is not already set. The test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then assert that the current IOLoop instance is the one just created. It then tries to create another IOLoop with `make_current=True` and expects it to raise a `RuntimeError`, which it should.

## Identified Bug
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter when it is `True`. The logic for checking and handling the current IOLoop is incorrect, which causes the failing test to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. Specifically, when `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current IOLoop instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. If it doesn't exist, then it should set the current IOLoop.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test.
