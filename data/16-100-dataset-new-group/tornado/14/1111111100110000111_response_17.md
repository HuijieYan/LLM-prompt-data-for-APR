## Fix for the bug

### Analysis:
- The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` object and tries to make the new `IOLoop` the current one when `make_current` argument is not provided. If `make_current` is provided as `True`, it checks again for the presence of a current `IOLoop` object and raises an error if it already exists.
- The failing test indicates that when `make_current=True`, the function is mistakenly assuming that no current `IOLoop` instance exists, leading to the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error.

### Potential error location:
The issue is likely with the condition where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before attempting to make it the current one.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `IOLoop` class's `initialize` method. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it incorrectly assumes that no current `IOLoop` instance exists, leading to the error message being raised.

### Bug-fix Strategy:
The logic in the `initialize` method should be modified to correctly identify the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance and proceed accordingly. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should check if a current instance already exists and raise an error if it does.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other functions and documentation

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise an error if it does
            self.make_current()
```

After applying this correction, the `initialize` method should now correctly handle the `make_current` argument and avoid raising the `RuntimeError` when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
