The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the failing test to raise a `RuntimeError`. The issue is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function incorrectly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and then raises an error if it doesn't. However, this check does not consider the case where a current instance already exists.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to always attempt to make the current instance if `make_current` is `True`, and only raise an error if a current instance already exists.
2. Remove unnecessary checks for a current instance when `make_current` is `None`.
3. Modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
