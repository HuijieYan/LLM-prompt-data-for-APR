The bug in the initialize function of class IOLoop is causing a RuntimeError when the make_current flag is set to True. The error occurs because the code checks for the current IOLoop instance using the wrong method.

To fix this bug, the initialize function should first check if make_current is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists, and then make the current instance. If make_current is False, it should only initialize the IOLoop instance without making it the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this correction, the initialize function will check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance based on the make_current flag and handle the RuntimeError accordingly.
