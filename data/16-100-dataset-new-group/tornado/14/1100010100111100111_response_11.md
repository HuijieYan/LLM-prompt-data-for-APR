### Potential Error Locations
The potential error location in the buggy function is in the `initialize` method, specifically in the `make_current` conditional statements.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic in the `initialize` method is incorrect. When `make_current` is `True`, the function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This is leading to the failing test and the reported GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the `initialize` method needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an existing `IOLoop` instance is present.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` is added to correctly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`. This fixes the bug and resolves the reported GitHub issue.
