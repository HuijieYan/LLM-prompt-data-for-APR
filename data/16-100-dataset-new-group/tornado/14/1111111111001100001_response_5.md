The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class, and it takes a parameter `make_current` which defaults to `None`. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it sets the current instance. If `make_current` is provided and evaluates to `True`, it also checks for a current `IOLoop` instance and sets it if none exists, otherwise it raises a `RuntimeError`.

The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and then asserts that it is the current instance. It then tries to create another instance with `make_current=True` and expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised.

The bug in the `initialize` function is that it doesn't handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. It should only set the current instance if none exists, regardless of the value of `make_current`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to only set the current instance if none exists, regardless of the value of `make_current`. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and current_instance is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. The failing test `test_force_current` should now pass.
