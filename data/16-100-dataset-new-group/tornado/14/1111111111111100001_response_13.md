The buggy function initializes an IOLoop and is failing when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. The error message indicates that a RuntimeError is raised because a current IOLoop already exists, which suggests that the issue lies in the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

The buggy function initializes the IOLoop instance based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect, leading to the RuntimeError being raised when it shouldn't.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function to properly check if a current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make the IOLoop instance current.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we modified the logic for the `make_current` parameter to properly check if a current IOLoop exists before attempting to make the IOLoop instance current. This should fix the issue and make the failing test pass.
