1. The buggy function is a part of the `IOLoop` class, which is a level-triggered I/O loop implementation.
2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements and the `make_current()` function.
3. The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly. The function is supposed to make the current IOLoop instance based on the value of `make_current`, but the conditionals and the `make_current()` function are not implemented correctly.
4. In order to fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements and use the `make_current()` function appropriately based on the value of `make_current`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):  # Change default value to True
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # Check if current IOLoop does not exist
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the default value of `make_current` parameter is changed to `True`. The function then checks whether to make the current IOLoop instance based on the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is True, it checks if the current instance already exists and raises an error if it does. If `make_current` is False, it checks if the current instance does not exist and then makes the current instance.
