### Analysis
The error message states that the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None` when it should not be. This causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". The issue on GitHub also points to this line as the potential cause of the bug.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are the condition checks for `make_current is None` and `make_current` being true. These conditions might be incorrectly detecting the current state of `IOLoop`.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the condition checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is not working correctly. The function expects `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to return a valid instance, but it is returning `None`, causing the function to raise an error even when the current `IOLoop` does not exist.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditions in the `initialize` function to check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance in a more reliable way. This may involve altering the logic for `make_current is None` and `make_current` being true.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and current_ioloop is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
In this corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the `current_ioloop` variable. Then we check if `make_current` is `None` and the `current_ioloop` does not exist, we make the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `True` and `current_ioloop` exists, we raise an error. If `make_current` is `True` and `current_ioloop` does not exist, we make the current `IOLoop`.
