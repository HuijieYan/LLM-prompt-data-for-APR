The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance, and it takes an optional input parameter `make_current`. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there's already a current `IOLoop` instance and makes itself the current one if not. If `make_current` is `True`, it explicitly tries to make itself the current instance and raises an error if there's already a current one.

Looking at the runtime input values and types:
- Input parameter `make_current`: `True`, type: `bool`

The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and whether there's already a current `IOLoop` instance.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements inside the function are not handling the cases of `make_current` correctly. The current implementation will only work for the case when `make_current` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to correctly handle all cases of `make_current`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we explicitly check if `make_current is True` and whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists before trying to make itself the current one. Then we handle the cases correctly and would show the behavior as expected.
