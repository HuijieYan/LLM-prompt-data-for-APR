### Correction
The issue with the buggy function is that it is not checking the condition properly for the existence of `IOLoop` before raising the RuntimeError.

#### Fix Strategy
1. Check the condition for the existence of `IOLoop` properly to avoid raising the RuntimeError incorrectly.
2. Call the `make_current` method if needed.

#### The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Corrected condition to check if IOLoop exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition for existing `IOLoop`, the bug will be fixed and the RuntimeError will not be incorrectly raised. This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub.
