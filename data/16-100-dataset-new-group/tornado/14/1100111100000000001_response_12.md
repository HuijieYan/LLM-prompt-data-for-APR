## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `make_current` function is being used without `self.make_current`, which could lead to incorrect function calling.
2. The comparison `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might not be evaluating as expected.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by using `make_current` and `IOLoop.current` without the proper class instance (i.e., `self.make_current` and `self.current`).

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to ensure that the `make_current` and `IOLoop.current` functions are called using the correct class instances. This can be achieved by using `self.make_current` and `self.current` instead of calling them directly.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
