## Explanation
The buggy function "initialize" is not handling the "make_current" parameter correctly. It should only raise a RuntimeError if "make_current" is True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None.

The failing test "test_force_current" creates an IOLoop instance with make_current=True, then attempts to create another IOLoop instance with make_current=True, which should fail and raise a RuntimeError. However, this test is currently failing because the buggy function does not correctly handle the make_current parameter.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements inside the "initialize" function to check for the correct conditions when "make_current" is True. Specifically, we need to only raise a RuntimeError if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None and "make_current" is True.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
