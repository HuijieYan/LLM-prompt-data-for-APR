The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True`. However, there are potential error locations in the following lines:

```python
if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
    self.make_current()
```
and
```python
if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `None`, the function does not correctly check for the current `IOLoop` instance and set the current instance if it doesn't exist. Additionally, the check for the current `IOLoop` instance is not performed correctly when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the current `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current instance if it doesn't exist, and raise an error if it already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
