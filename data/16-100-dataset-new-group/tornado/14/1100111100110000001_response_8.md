The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop. However, the bug in the function causes a RuntimeError to be raised when the `make_current` flag is set to `True` due to an existing IOLoop instance.

The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`. It does check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `None`, but it fails to handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, the logic needs to be updated to handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and ensure that a new IOLoop is created without raising a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                # Existing instance found, should not raise an error
                return
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, when `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if an IOLoop already exists. If an IOLoop instance is found, it simply returns without raising an error. This will allow the function to create a new IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to `True`.
