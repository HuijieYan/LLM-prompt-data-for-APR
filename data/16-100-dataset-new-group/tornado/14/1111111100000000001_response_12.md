## Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` function occurs in the conditional check for `make_current`. The intent of the function is to initialize the current IOLoop, but there is a bug in how it checks for an existing IOLoop. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect, as it should be checking for the presence of an active IOLoop instead of a `None` value.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition to check whether there is an existing IOLoop, rather than checking for `None`. We can utilize the `IOLoop.current()` function to achieve this. Additionally, we should also handle the case where `make_current=False`. 

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.initialized():
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
