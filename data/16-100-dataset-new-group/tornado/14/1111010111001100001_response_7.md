The buggy function `initialize` is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance, and it fails when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument. The buggy function fails the test because it does not handle the case when an `IOLoop` instance is already current, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we should update the `initialize` function to first check if the current `IOLoop` instance is already set before attempting to make the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current or (make_current is None and current_instance is None):
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case when an `IOLoop` instance is already current, and it should now pass the failing test.
