The buggy function `initialize` is checking if a current `IOLoop` already exists and should only initialize a new one if `make_current` is set to `True` and there is no current `IOLoop`. 

The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` but a current `IOLoop` already exists, causing the function to raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

To fix this bug, the function should only attempt to make the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `None`, it should behave as if `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this fix, the function will only attempt to make the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop`, and it will raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` but a current `IOLoop` already exists.
