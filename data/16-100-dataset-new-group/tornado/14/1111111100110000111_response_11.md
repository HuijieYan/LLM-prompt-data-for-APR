The bug in the initialize() function of the IOLoop class appears to be related to the logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop instance. When initializing an IOLoop object with the make_current=True parameter, the function checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If so, it should raise a RuntimeError, but in this case, it erroneously raises the error even if the instance is None.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect condition in the if statement for checking the current IOLoop instance. The bug seems to be triggered when make_current=True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, but the condition incorrectly raises the error anyway.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking if the current IOLoop instance exists needs to be adjusted so that it correctly handles the make_current parameter and raises the RuntimeError only when there is an existing current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize() function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the current IOLoop instance is retrieved at the beginning of the function and then used to check the conditions for make_current=None and make_current=True, ensuring that the RuntimeError is only raised when there is an existing current instance but make_current=True. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as intended.
