The issue is related to the behavior of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class. The problem occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

The bug is caused by incorrect conditional logic in the `initialize` function. The logic does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to properly check for the conditions where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `initialize` function now properly handles the case where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, preventing the unnecessary `RuntimeError` from being raised.
