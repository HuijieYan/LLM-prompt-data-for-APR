### Bug Fix

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly. The `initialize` function should check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it the current IOLoop. 

The bug is causing the `test_force_current` test to fail because it expects the RuntimeError to be raised in case a second `make_current=True` construction is attempted. However, the bug in the `initialize` function allows this construction to succeed without raising the RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that it raises a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop already exists.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change this line
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Change this line
        self.make_current()

```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function now properly checks if the current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make it the current IOLoop. It ensures that the RuntimeError is raised if a second `make_current=True` construction is attempted while the current IOLoop already exists. This fix addresses the bug and should resolve the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
