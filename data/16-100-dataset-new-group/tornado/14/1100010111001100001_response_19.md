### Analysis
The buggy function checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and makes it current if it doesn't. However, the failing test is expecting the RuntimeError to be raised when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` if the current instance already exists.

### Potential error location
The potential error is in the conditional statements where the function checks if `make_current` is None or True.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument in the initialize function. The function does not properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists, leading to the failing test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to explicitly check if a current IOLoop instance exists when `make_current=True` and raise a RuntimeError if it does. This will ensure that the failing test passes.

### Corrected version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
