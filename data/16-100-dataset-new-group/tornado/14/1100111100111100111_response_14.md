The bug in the provided code is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The bug causes a RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly when `make_current` is set to True.

The potential error location is within the conditional statement that checks the value of `make_current` and then raises a RuntimeError.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement is incorrectly checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and raising a RuntimeError even when `make_current` is set to True.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be modified to only raise a RuntimeError when `make_current` is set to True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the bug should be fixed and the function should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
