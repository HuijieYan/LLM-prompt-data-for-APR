The buggy function `initialize` is failing to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. The issue originates from the conditional checks on the `make_current` parameter and the usage of the `IOLoop.current` and `make_current` functions.

The problem is observed when `make_current` is `True`. The function checks if `IOLoop.current` is `None` and then sets it to the current instance using `self.make_current()`. However, it does not raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop`, which is the expected behavior according to the test function `test_force_current`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement where `make_current` is `True` to raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test.
