The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is not handling the case where `make_current` is set to `True` correctly. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the method checks if an IOLoop instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it does not exist, the method should make the current IOLoop instance, but instead it raises a `RuntimeError` claiming that the current IOLoop already exists.

The bug arises from the incorrect condition checking in the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should only proceed to make the current IOLoop if an instance does not exist. However, the code is not handling this condition properly.

To fix the bug, the condition when `make_current` is set to `True` needs to be modified to ensure that the current IOLoop instance is only made if it does not already exist.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method now checks for the presence of the current IOLoop instance correctly and makes the instance only if it does not already exist.

By making this change, the `initialize` method will now handle the `make_current` argument properly and should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
