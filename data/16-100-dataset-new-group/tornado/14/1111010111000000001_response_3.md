The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logical error where it incorrectly checks for the current `IOLoop` instance and tries to make the current instance. The error seems to be in the logic that determines whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance or not.

The `initialize` function is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance, but the logic for checking and setting the current instance seems to be flawed, causing the failing test `test_force_current` to actually fail.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. The current logic checks if the instance is already set and tries to set it again causing unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly set the current instance based on the value of `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
            return
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
        return
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is `None` and if the current instance does not exist, we make the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, we check if the current instance already exists, and if it does, we raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we make the current instance. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
