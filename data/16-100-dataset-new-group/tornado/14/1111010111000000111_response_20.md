## Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `make_current` argument.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional checks for `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` might not be working as expected.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` argument might be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug:
The issue is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the logic checks if the current `IOLoop` exists and raises an error if it does exist. However, the conditional check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not working as expected, leading to the erroneous behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the conditional checks for `make_current` and the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance need to be revised. Additionally, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument should be re-evaluated to ensure that the correct behavior is enforced.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the revised logic, the conditional check for `make_current` has been corrected, and the logic for handling the availability of the current `IOLoop` instance has been fixed. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
