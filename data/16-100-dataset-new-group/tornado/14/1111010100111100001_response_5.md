The buggy function `initialize` is designed to make the current IOLoop. Its purpose is to check if there is already a current IOLoop and if not, make the current IOLoop.

The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, the function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` because it is detecting a current IOLoop, even though it should be trying to make the current IOLoop.

The bug seems to be in the logic that checks if a current IOLoop exists when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, the logic should be updated to only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is no current IOLoop when `make_current` is `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This correction should prevent the unnecessary `RuntimeError` from being raised and ensure that the `make_current` functionality works as intended.
