Based on the analysis of the buggy function and related classes and functions, along with the GitHub issue, here are the identified potential error locations and the cause of the bug:

1. Potential Error Location:
   - The `initialize()` function is not handling the `make_current` argument correctly, which leads to unexpected behavior.

2. Cause of the Bug:
   - In the `initialize()` function, when `make_current` is not provided, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None. If it is, then it calls `make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is provided and is True, it checks if the current instance is None and raises an error if it is not None. This logic is contradictory and leads to confusion.

3. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
   - Modify the logic in the `initialize()` function to handle the `make_current` argument consistently and effectively. The function should ensure that the IOLoop instance is created and made current when necessary, without the potential for contradictory behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize()` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
1. The logic is modified to handle the `make_current` argument more clearly.
2. If `make_current` is None or True, it checks if the current instance is not None and raises an error if it's already active.
3. If `make_current` is False, it ensures that the IOLoop instance is made current if it doesn't already exist.
