## Analysis
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance and set it as the current instance. The bug seems to be related to the conditional checks for `make_current` and the use of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

## Bugs
1. The `initialize` function is not calling the `make_current` method correctly.
2. Conditional checks for `make_current` are incorrect.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional check in the `initialize` function. If `make_current` is not provided, it should call `make_current()` if the current instance is None. If `make_current` is provided and is True, it should raise a RuntimeError if the current instance is not None.

## Strategy for Fixing
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks and the usage of `make_current()`. The function needs to check whether to call `make_current` based on the value of `make_current`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # Removed the redundant elif condition
            if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed the condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
With these changes, the conditional checks and the calls to `make_current` should work correctly, resolving the issue.
