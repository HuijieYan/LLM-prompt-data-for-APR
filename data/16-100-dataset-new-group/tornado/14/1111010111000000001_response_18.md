The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the current `IOLoop` instance, making it the current instance if none exists, and raising an error if there is already a current instance and `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the bug occurs when the function fails to correctly handle the `make_current` argument.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` does not handle the case where `make_current` is `False`.
2. The `self.make_current()` call does not have a condition to check if `make_current` is `True`.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly checking the `make_current` argument.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle all possible cases of the `make_current` argument.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle the `make_current` argument and pass the failing test.
