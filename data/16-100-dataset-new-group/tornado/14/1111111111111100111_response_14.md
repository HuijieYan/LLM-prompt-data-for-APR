There are potential errors in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is passed as `True`, triggering the `if make_current` block. In this block, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". However, this logic is incorrect because when `make_current` is set to `True`, the program should assume that the current `IOLoop` exists, and it should not raise an error.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic inside the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class to properly handle the case when `make_current` is passed as `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True`, the program checks if the current `IOLoop` exists, and if it does, then it raises a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it makes the current `IOLoop` instance.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and also make the failing test case `test_force_current` pass.
