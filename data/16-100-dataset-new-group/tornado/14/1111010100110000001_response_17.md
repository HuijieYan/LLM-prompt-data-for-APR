The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize the event loop, and by default, it should make the current `IOLoop` instance unless there already is a current one. However, there is a bug where it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop`. This is contrary to the intended behavior as per the class documentation.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should not be checked when `make_current` is `True`. Instead, the function should simply set the current `IOLoop` instance without checking for an already existing instance.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to always attempt to make the current `IOLoop` instance unless it explicitly provides `make_current=False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

This modification ensures that the `initialize` function behaves as documented, and it should fix the bug causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised.
