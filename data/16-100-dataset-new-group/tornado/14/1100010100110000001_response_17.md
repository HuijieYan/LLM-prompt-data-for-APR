### Analysis
The error message indicates that the function `initialize` is trying to force the current IOLoop, but it's failing because the current IOLoop already exists, resulting in a `RuntimeError`.

### Potential Error Locations
- The `if` condition inside the `initialize` function that checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists.
- The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is causing the issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The function should only make the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist. However, the current logic is erroneously attempting to create the current IOLoop even when it already exists, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter needs to be updated. The function should only attempt to make the current IOLoop if it does not already exist.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()

```
