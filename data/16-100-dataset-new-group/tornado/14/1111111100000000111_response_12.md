## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and then making it current using `self.make_current()`. The issue mentioned on GitHub questions why the code raises "already exists" even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might not be evaluating as expected.
2. No distinction between the cases where `make_current` is `None` and where it is `False`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect evaluation of `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the logic for handling the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is evaluating correctly.
2. Update the logic to handle the `make_current` argument appropriately, distinguishing between the cases where it is `None` and where it is `False`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The corrected version addresses the bug by checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `None`, and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
