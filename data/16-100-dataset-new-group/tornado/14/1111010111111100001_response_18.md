The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and checks that an error is raised if a current `IOLoop` already exists.

The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

The buggy function initializes the `IOLoop` instance and checks whether there is already a current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop`, it raises the `RuntimeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is evaluating to `False` when it should be `True`.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the current `IOLoop` instance should be inverted so that it raises an error only when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By fixing the condition to check for the presence of a current instance, the bug should be resolved and the failing test should now pass.
