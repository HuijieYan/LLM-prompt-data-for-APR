The cause of the bug in the `initialize` function is that when `make_current=True`, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should be `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` in order to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does exist, then a `RuntimeError` should be raised.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditionals where the current IOLoop instance is checked and the `RuntimeError` is raised when `make_current=True`.

To fix the bug, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should be changed to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` and then raise a `RuntimeError` in this case.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should pass the failing test.
