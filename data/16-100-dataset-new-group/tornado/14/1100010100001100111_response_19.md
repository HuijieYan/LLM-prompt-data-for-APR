The issue appears to be related to the function initialize in the ioloop.py file. The problem occurs at line 252, where it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None or not. However, regardless of the result of this check, the function may still raise a "current IOLoop already exists" error.

The potential error locations in the code are the if-elif statements that handle the make_current parameter. It seems that the logic is not properly handling the case when make_current is True.

The cause of the bug is that the if-elif conditions are not properly checking whether the current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it current or raising an error.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic inside the function to properly handle the make_current parameter and the existing IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current IOLoop instance in the current_instance variable. Then, we properly check whether the current instance is None or not in both if and elif conditions, and perform the necessary actions accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and prevent the function from raising an error when the current IOLoop instance already exists.
