The potential error in the buggy function is in the logic flow when checking the current IOLoop instance and deciding whether to make it the current instance or raise an error.

The bug is caused by the incorrect logic flow inside the function. When the `make_current` parameter is `True`, the function should only make the current IOLoop instance if it does not already exist. However, the current implementation incorrectly checks if the current instance is None, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError, even when `make_current` is set to `True.

To fix the bug, the logic should be modified to only make the current IOLoop instance if it does not exist and `make_current` is `True. Otherwise, if `make_current` is None, it should check if the current instance is None, and if so, make it the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue by fixing the logic flow and addressing the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
