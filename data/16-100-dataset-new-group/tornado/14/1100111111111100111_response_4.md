## Corrections:

1. The bug in the code is that the `make_current` parameter is not being appropriately handled in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. This is causing the RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly.

2. The buggy function `initialize` needs to be modified to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is True, the code is checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and then raising a RuntimeError based on that condition. This logic is incorrect and causing the failing test and the corresponding error message.

4. The bug can be fixed by removing the check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` when `make_current` is True, and only calling `self.make_current()` in that case.

5. Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # existing code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

By removing the unnecessary check and only calling `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is True, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
