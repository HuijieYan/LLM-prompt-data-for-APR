The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance, and when `make_current` is set to `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional block that checks the value of `make_current`.
```python
if make_current:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```

The bug is caused by the conditional statement not correctly checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and instead, it always tries to make the current `IOLoop`.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditional block to only attempt to make the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly check for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make it the current instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. This should address the bug and make the failing test case pass.
