The `initialize` function in `tornado/ioloop.py` contains the bug. The code is intended to check if an IOLoop current instance exists and then either make it the current instance or raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is set to `True` and an instance already exists. However, the current implementation is flawed as it incorrectly checks for the presence of an instance and raises a `RuntimeError` in the wrong scenarios.

The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, which should succeed, and then create another instance also with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` as a current IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to whether `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, rather than the other way around. We also need to set the current instance correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is `None` or `True`. If so, we proceed to check if a current instance already exists. If it does, we raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we set the current instance using `self.make_current()`. Now, this corrected version should pass the failing test.
