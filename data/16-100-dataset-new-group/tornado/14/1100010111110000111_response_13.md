The potential error location within the initialize function is the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. The cause of the bug is that the `if` condition is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current()` is None.

To fix the bug, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should be removed so that the RuntimeError is not raised unnecessarily.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
```

This correction ensures that the RuntimeError is only raised if `IOLoop.current()` is not None and `make_current` is True. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
