The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. It checks whether the `make_current` parameter is None, and if so, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is True, it checks if the `IOLoop.current` is None, and if not, it raises a RuntimeError.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the conditional statement `if make_current:`. This is where the code is incorrectly raising a RuntimeError even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not properly checked before raising the RuntimeError. The current setup raises the error regardless of the value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to remove the unnecessary check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` after the conditional `if make_current:`. Since the condition `if make_current:` already implies that `make_current` is True, there is no need for an additional check before raising the RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other methods...

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the corrected version, the conditional `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` has been removed, and the `self.make_current()` call is made before checking if the current IOLoop already exists. This change ensures that the RuntimeError is only raised if the current IOLoop exists after attempting to make it the current one.
