## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The condition `if make_current is None` could potentially lead to incorrect behavior.
2. The condition `elif make_current:` might not be handling the cases correctly.

## Cause of the bug
The bug causes the test case `test_force_current` to fail because the `make_current` behavior is not being handled correctly in the `initialize` function. The `initialize` function is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop, and the `make_current` parameter is intended to control whether the new IOLoop should try to become the current IOLoop. However, the conditions for handling `None` and `True` values of `make_current` are not correctly implemented, leading to the RuntimeError when it should not be raised.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check the `make_current` parameter handling in the `initialize` function and ensure that the conditions for `None` and `True` are correctly implemented.
2. Modify the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` parameter as per the intended behavior, ensuring that it does not raise a RuntimeError incorrectly.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions and class members remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # Updated the condition to handle both None and True cases
            if make_current is True:  # Check if make_current is True
                if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
                    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
                self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the test case `test_force_current` should pass without raising a RuntimeError.
