The potential error in the `initialize` function is that it's not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter.

The bug is causing the `test_force_current` test to fail. The test is trying to construct two `IOLoop` instances with `make_current=True`, and it expects the second construction to raise a `RuntimeError` because the current `IOLoop` already exists. However, the bug allows the second construction to proceed without raising the `RuntimeError`, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, it's important to properly handle the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function to ensure that only one `IOLoop` instance can be made current at a time.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the function checks if `make_current` is True and if there's already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If there isn't, it proceeds to make the current `IOLoop` instance. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
