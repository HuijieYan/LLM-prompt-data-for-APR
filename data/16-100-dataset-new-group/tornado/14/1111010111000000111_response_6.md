#### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` is checking if `make_current` is `None` and then attempting to make the IOLoop current. However, it is also supposed to check if `make_current` is `True` and then raise an error if the current IOLoop already exists.
- The failing test `test_force_current` is testing the behavior of creating an IOLoop with `make_current=True` and is expecting the RuntimeError to be raised if another IOLoop is already current.
- The GitHub issue is questioning the behavior of line 252 in ioloop.py, specifically the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and then raising the error "already exists".

#### Bug Identification:
- The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not correctly checking the condition where `make_current` is `True`. It checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` before raising the error, but it should be checking for the presence of an already current IOLoop.
- This bug causes the test `test_force_current` to fail because the error is not being raised as expected when attempting to create another IOLoop with `make_current=True`.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditional statement for `make_current=True` to check if there is already a current IOLoop before attempting to make the current IOLoop. If there is already a current IOLoop, it should raise the RuntimeError as expected.
- Additionally, the condition to make the IOLoop current when `make_current` is `None` can be simplified to avoid redundant checks.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
