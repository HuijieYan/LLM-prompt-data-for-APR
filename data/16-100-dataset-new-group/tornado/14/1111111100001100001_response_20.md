The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object, and it takes an optional parameter `make_current` which controls whether the initialized `IOLoop` should become the current instance. 

The potential error in the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case when `make_current` is `False`. 

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `False`, the function should not try to become the current instance, but it currently doesn't handle this case.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `make_current` is `False`. If it is `False`, the function should not attempt to become the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # check if make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:  # if make_current is False, do nothing
        pass
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `False` and avoid trying to become the current instance.
