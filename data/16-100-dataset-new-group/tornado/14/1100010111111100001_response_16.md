The buggy function `initialize` is designed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop class, with an optional parameter `make_current` that defaults to `None`. However, the function fails to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`, as indicated by the failing test `test_force_current`.

The failing test creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then tries to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the test fails, indicating that the RuntimeError is not being raised as expected.

The error message indicates that the issue is occurring in the `initialize` function of the `tornado/ioloop.py` file, specifically in the block of code that handles the `make_current` parameter.

The issue with the current implementation is that the condition `if make_current:` checks if `make_current` is truthy, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` only if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. This logic does not account for the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, the logic should be updated to raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass, and the `RuntimeError` should be raised when trying to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.
