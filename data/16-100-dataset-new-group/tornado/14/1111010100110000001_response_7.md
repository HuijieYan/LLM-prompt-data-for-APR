The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class and is used to initialize the instance of `IOLoop`. The error message indicates that when trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, the function is attempting to raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists." However, the current instance already exists, so it should not raise this error.

The bug is located in the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class where it checks whether the current instance already exists and should only `self.make_current()` if it does not exist.

The bug causes the function to raise a `RuntimeError` when it is not supposed to. The function should only raise this error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. However, the code does not take into account the case when `make_current` is `False` and a current instance exists, which should not raise an error.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` to only raise it when `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists. When `make_current` is `False`, it should not try to make the new `IOLoop` instance the current one, even if a current instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function checks for two conditions:
1. When `make_current` is `None`, it calls `self.make_current()` only if a current instance does not exist.
2. When `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists, otherwise, it sets the new instance as the current one.

This corrected version should no longer raise the `RuntimeError` when creating an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`.
