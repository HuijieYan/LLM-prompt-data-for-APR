The bug in the initialize function is that it incorrectly checks for the current IOLoop instance, leading to the RuntimeError being raised when it shouldn't. The bug is caused by the wrong use of the current function from the IOLoop class.

To fix this bug:
1. Change the function call `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to `IOLoop.current()`.
2. Update the condition `if IOLoop.current() is None:` to `if IOLoop.current() is not None:` to ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when the IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With these changes, the buggy function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
