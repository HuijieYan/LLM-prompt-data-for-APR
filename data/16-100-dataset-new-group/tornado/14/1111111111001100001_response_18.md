The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop, making it the current IOLoop if necessary. However, the bug in the initialize function causes it to incorrectly check for the current IOLoop instance, leading to the failing test.

The function checks whether a current IOLoop instance exists, and if not, it tries to make the current IOLoop. The bug occurs in the condition `if make_current is None` where it checks whether the `make_current` argument is provided. If not provided, the function checks for the current IOLoop instance. However, when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, it should bypass the condition and make the current IOLoop directly.

In the failing test `test_force_current`, the make_current argument is explicitly set to `True` when initializing the IOLoop. The test then checks whether the IOLoop becomes the current instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if an attempt is made to create a second current instance with make_current set to `True`. However, the buggy function does not make the IOLoop the current instance when `make_current` is set to `True`, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the condition `if make_current is None` should be changed to `if make_current is None or make_current is True` so that when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, it will bypass the condition and the IOLoop will become the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
