The buggy function "initialize" is checking if the parameter "make_current" is None, and if so, it calls "self.make_current()" if there is no current IOLoop instance. If "make_current" is not None, it then checks if "make_current" is True, and if the current IOLoop instance does not exist, it raises a RuntimeError, otherwise it calls "self.make_current()". 

There are a few potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition "if make_current is None" should be checked using "is None" instead of "== None".
2. It is not clear what "self.make_current()" does, so it's possible that this function could be causing the bug.
3. There is a potential issue with the logic for checking if the current IOLoop instance exists.

The cause of the bug may be related to the logic used to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance, as well as the potential behavior of "self.make_current()".

To fix the bug, we should first ensure that the condition for checking if "make_current" is None uses "is None" instead of "== None". Then, we should review the behavior of the "self.make_current()" function to understand its purpose and ensure it is being called correctly. Finally, we should review the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance to ensure it is working as intended.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # changed to else instead of elif to cover both None and True cases
        if make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # corrected the condition to check if IOLoop instance exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have fixed the condition for checking the value of "make_current", and we have also adjusted the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance.
