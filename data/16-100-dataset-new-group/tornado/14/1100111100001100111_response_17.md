The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class seems to be related to the conditional checks and the use of the `make_current` parameter. The GitHub issue suggests that there is a confusion around the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the subsequent raise of "current IOLoop already exists".

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional checks and the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks for `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` are not properly aligned, leading to the incorrect behavior of raising a RuntimeError even when the `make_current` parameter is True.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter need to be revised.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # removed redundant check for make_current
        if make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:  # corrected condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use `self.current` instead of `IOLoop.current` to call the function from the same class.
2. We fixed the condition to check if `self.current(instance=False)` is not None when `make_current` is True.
3. We removed the redundant check for `make_current`, as it is already handled by the `if make_current is None` condition.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `initialize` function behaves as expected.
