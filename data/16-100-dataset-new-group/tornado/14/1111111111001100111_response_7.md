### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The conditional statement checking for `make_current` being `None` and then calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` may not be handling the logic correctly.
2. The conditional statement checking for `make_current` being `True` and then calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` might not be raising the correct error.

### Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be related to the logic of setting the current `IOLoop`. The `initialize` function is supposed to handle the logic for making the current `IOLoop`, but the conditional statements and method calls may not be working as intended. This is evident from the failing test where the second `make_current=True` construction fails to raise an error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the logic for checking and setting the current `IOLoop` needs to be revised. The conditional statements involving `make_current` and the calls to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` need to be reviewed and potentially modified. 

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statements are simplified to handle both `None` and `True` cases together, and the error is raised if the current `IOLoop` already exists.
