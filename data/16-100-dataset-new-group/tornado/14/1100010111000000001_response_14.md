The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` does not seem to be handled correctly.
2. The `elif make_current` condition also needs to be checked.

The cause of the bug can be explained by the failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`. The test is trying to force the current IOLoop to be made, and then it checks if an attempt to make the current IOLoop again raises a `RuntimeError`. The buggy function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that it behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the bug should be fixed and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass as expected.
