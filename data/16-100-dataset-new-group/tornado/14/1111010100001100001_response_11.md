The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True`, and if it is `None`, it should make the current `IOLoop` if one doesn't exist. However, the implementation is incorrect and does not handle the cases properly.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect condition checks for `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
2. Inadequate handling of the case when `make_current` is `None`.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, it always checks if the current `IOLoop` exists and raises an error if it does. It should instead check if there is no current `IOLoop` and then proceed with making the current `IOLoop`.

To fix the bug, the function should:
1. Check if `make_current` is `None` and call `self.make_current()` if the current `IOLoop` doesn't exist.
2. Check if `make_current` is `True` and call `self.make_current()` only if the current `IOLoop` does not exist, otherwise raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version handles the cases where `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or any other value correctly.
