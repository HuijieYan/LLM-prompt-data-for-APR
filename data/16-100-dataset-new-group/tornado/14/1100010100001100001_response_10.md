### Analyzing the buggy function
The `initialize` function is intended to initialize the current IOLoop. It takes an optional parameter `make_current`, which is a boolean indicating whether the current IOLoop should be made.

### Potential error locations
The potential error in the function is in the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current IOLoop.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and the current IOLoop already exists. In this case, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` according to the intended logic, but instead, it tries to make the current IOLoop again.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to modify the conditional statements to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in that case.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
