### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance. It takes an optional `make_current` parameter to control if the instance should become the current `IOLoop`.

### Bug
The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`. If there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, the function should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the current logic only checks if there is no current instance and does not handle the case where there is one.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for when `make_current` is `True` to correctly check if there is already a current instance, and raise a `RuntimeError` if there is.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
