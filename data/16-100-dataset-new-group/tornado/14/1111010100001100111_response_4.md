### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is part of the class `IOLoop`. This function is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue on GitHub suggests that there is a problem with the logic of the function when checking for the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the function are the conditions for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and the logic for raising a `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by an incorrect condition check that leads to raising a `RuntimeError` when it should not. The condition for checking the current `IOLoop` instance may not be correctly evaluating to `None` or not `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Review the condition checks for checking the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Ensure that the logic for raising a `RuntimeError` is triggered only when the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing and `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
