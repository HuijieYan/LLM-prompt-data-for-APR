The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is not handling the `make_current` argument correctly. It should only check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is True. 

The function currently checks for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is None, which is incorrect. This is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised when it should not be.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` argument.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        pass
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Otherwise, it will simply pass if `make_current` is None.
