The bug in the provided function is causing the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error message when the `make_current` flag is set to `True`. The bug is due to the fact that the function is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic to explicitly check if the current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make it the current one.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if the current IOLoop exists before attempting to make it the current one, and it should pass the failing test.
