The buggy function `initialize` is meant to initialize `IOLoop` and set it as the current instance if necessary. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is evaluating to `True`, but the subsequent `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` is still executed.

The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are:
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` does not handle the case where `make_current` is `False`.
2. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not preventing the execution of `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` when the current instance is actually `None`.

The cause of the bug can be explained using the `initialize` function and the documentation of the `IOLoop` class:
1. The `initialize` function does not account for the potential value of `make_current` being `False`, so the condition `if make_current is None:` would default to `True` and the subsequent code may not behave as intended.
2. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is meant to ensure that a current instance does not already exist, but it is not preventing the `RuntimeError` from being raised even when the current instance is `None`, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can update the `initialize` function to handle all cases of the `make_current` argument and ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current instance actually exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:  # Handle the case when make_current is False
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the corrected version, we have added an additional condition to explicitly handle the case when `make_current` is `False`. We also updated the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current instance actually exists. These changes address the reported issue and provide a more comprehensive handling of the `make_current` argument.
