The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. However, there are issues with the conditional logic and calling the `make_current` method. 

The potential error locations are:
1. The conditional logic for `make_current=None` and `make_current=True` is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`.
2. The method `make_current()` is called without checking if it exists.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument. Additionally, the method `make_current()` is called without proper validation.

To fix the bug, we can update the conditional logic and add a validation check before calling the `make_current` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
