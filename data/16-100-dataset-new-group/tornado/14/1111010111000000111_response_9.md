## Analysis
The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. This method is used to initialize the IOLoop instance and make it the current instance depending on the value of the `make_current` argument.

The potential error location is within the conditional checks for `make_current` and the call to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks for `make_current` are not properly handling the case where `make_current` is `None`, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This causes the method to incorrectly attempt to make the current instance even when it already exists.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional checks within the `initialize` method need to be revised to handle the case where `make_current` is `None` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Additionally, the logic for setting the current instance needs to be adjusted to correctly handle potential race conditions.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other methods and properties)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version of the `initialize` method, it properly handles the case where `make_current` is `None` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The conditional checks have been revised to account for this scenario, and the logic for setting the current instance has been adjusted to handle potential race conditions. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the test function `test_force_current` passes successfully.
