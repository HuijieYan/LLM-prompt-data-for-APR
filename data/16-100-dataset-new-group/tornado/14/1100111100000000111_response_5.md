## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` class. It checks if the `make_current` argument is provided, and if not, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is provided and evaluates to `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if make_current is None` may not be evaluating as expected.
2. The condition `if make_current` may not be evaluating as expected.

## Cause of the Bug
The issue seems to suggest that the current `IOLoop` instance is checked even when `make_current` is `True`, which contradicts the logic in the code. This can happen due to incorrect evaluation of the conditions or logical errors in the if-else statements.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the evaluation of the `make_current` argument and ensure it correctly triggers the logic to create the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Verify the conditions that check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and ensure they are correctly evaluated based on the `make_current` argument.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current is False:  # Check if make_current is None or explicitly False
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Check if make_current is explicitly True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for `make_current` are explicitly checked for `None`, `False`, or `True` using the `is` keyword. The logic to create the current `IOLoop` instance and check its existence has been revised to adhere to the expected behavior.
