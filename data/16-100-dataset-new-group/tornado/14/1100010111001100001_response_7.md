The buggy function `initialize` seems to be designed to initialize the IOLoop, and it takes a parameter `make_current` which is a boolean value indicating whether to make the current IOLoop instance. 

The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current` to `True` and then checks if the IOLoop instance has been made current, and then attempts to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The bug in the `initialize` function seems to be that when `make_current=True`, the function is not properly checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it current, resulting in the `RuntimeError` not being raised as expected in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass, as it correctly handles the case when the current IOLoop instance already exists.
