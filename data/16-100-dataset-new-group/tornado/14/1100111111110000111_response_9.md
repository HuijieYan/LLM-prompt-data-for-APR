## The corrected version of the function

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the original buggy function, the logic for checking if the current IOLoop exists is incorrect. The buggy function assumes that if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, that means the IOLoop does not exist, which is incorrect. The correct logic is to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None to see if the IOLoop already exists.

By modifying the condition from `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in both branches of the if-else statements, the bug is fixed.

The corrected version of the function above should resolve the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
