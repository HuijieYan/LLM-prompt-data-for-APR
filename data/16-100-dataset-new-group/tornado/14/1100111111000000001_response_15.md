The root cause of the bug is that the `IOLoop.make_current()` method is not being called when `make_current` is True in the `initialize` method. This causes the `IOLoop.current()` method to return None, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should always call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is True.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the test function `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
