## Analysis and Bug Identification
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if necessary. However, the bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, resulting in a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

The GitHub issue indicates that the error is occurring on line 252, where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for being `None`, and there is confusion regarding why the "already exists" error is being raised in this case.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should only attempt to make the IOLoop current if it doesn't already exist. However, the current implementation incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` and raises the error based on that condition.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and check whether the IOLoop is already the current IOLoop before attempting to make it current.

## Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By storing the current IOLoop instance in a variable and properly checking for its existence, the corrected function ensures that the "already exists" error is only raised when necessary. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
