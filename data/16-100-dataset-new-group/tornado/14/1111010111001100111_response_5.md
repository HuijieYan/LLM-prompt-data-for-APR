The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance, with an optional argument `make_current` to control whether the new IOLoop should become the current one. The issue reported on GitHub indicates confusion regarding the behavior of the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` on line 252, which seems to contradict the subsequent error message "current IOLoop already exists".

### Potential Error Locations
1. The conditional statements in the `initialize` function that handle the `make_current` parameter could be the potential error locations.
2. The logic around checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance in combination with the `make_current` parameter might be causing the issue.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if a current IOLoop instance already exists. However, the current implementation incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, contradicting the logic.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter needs to be reviewed, and the conditional statements in the `initialize` function should be updated to ensure consistent behavior. It's necessary to accurately check whether a current IOLoop instance exists based on the return value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class members)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we first retrieve the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and store it in the `current_instance` variable. Then, we adjust the conditional statements based on the value of `current_instance` to ensure that the behavior aligns with the intended logic.
