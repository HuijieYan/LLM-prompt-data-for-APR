The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logic issue in the `if` condition where it checks for the current instance. It is incorrectly handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. This causes the failing test `test_force_current` to raise a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. It incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior where it should make the current `IOLoop` instance even if one exists.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `if` condition for `make_current` is changed to `elif make_current` to handle the case when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`. Additionally, the condition for checking the current `IOLoop` instance is modified to check if it is not `None`, and if so, raise the `RuntimeError`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
