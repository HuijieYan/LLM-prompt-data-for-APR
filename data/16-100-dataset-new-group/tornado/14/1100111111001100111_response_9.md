The issue is related to the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class within the `ioloop.py` file. The problem arises when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` which is not being handled correctly, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

The buggy function fails the test because it does not properly handle the `make_current` parameter, which should ensure that only one current `IOLoop` instance exists at a time.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Improper handling of the `make_current` parameter.
2. Inconsistent usage of the `IOLoop.current` and `make_current` functions.
3. Failure to check and enforce the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The function does not properly check whether an `IOLoop` instance already exists and does not enforce the condition for only one current `IOLoop` instance to exist at a time. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly, as observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and enforce the condition for only one current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `make_current` parameter is properly handled, and the condition for enforcing the existence of only one current `IOLoop` instance is appropriately enforced. This should resolve the issue on GitHub and pass the failing test in the `ioloop_test.py` file.
