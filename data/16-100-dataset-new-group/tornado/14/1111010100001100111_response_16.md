### Identification of potential error locations
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` does not seem to be handling the already existing `IOLoop` instance correctly.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` argument appears to be inconsistent.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument and the existing `IOLoop` instance. The code does not properly check for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the condition for `make_current=True` to properly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Update the logic to handle the `make_current` argument consistently and appropriately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
