## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the initialize function is that it does not handle the case where IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None properly. The buggy code only checks for None, and as a result, it incorrectly raises a RuntimeError. 

To fix this bug, we need to add an else statement to handle the case when IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None. If make_current is None, and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, it should raise a RuntimeError. And if make_current is True, and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, it should also raise a RuntimeError.

The corrected version of the function includes these changes, and it will pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
