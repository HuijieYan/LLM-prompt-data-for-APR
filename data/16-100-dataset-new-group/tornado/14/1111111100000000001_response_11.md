The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue with the `make_current` argument handling. The function should either make the current IOLoop instance or raise an error if there is already a current instance. The issue is in the if-else conditions for `make_current`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statements to properly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that the current IOLoop instance is set correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first obtain the current instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then we check the value of the `make_current` argument and set the current instance accordingly. If `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance, we raise a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is False and there is no current instance, we make the current instance.
