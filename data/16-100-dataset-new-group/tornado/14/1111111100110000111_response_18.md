To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we need to modify the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The bug is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised when it shouldn't be.

The issue arises from the `initialize` function's check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function.

To fix the bug:
- We need to update the condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The problem is likely in the condition `if make_current is None:` and `if make_current:` blocks.

A potential fix for this issue is to update the `initialize` function to always check the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and only call `self.make_current()` when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current()
        
        if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current and current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In this corrected version:
- We first obtain the current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current()`.
- Then, we check the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current instance to decide whether to make the current instance or raise an error.

This corrected version should address the bug reported in the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
