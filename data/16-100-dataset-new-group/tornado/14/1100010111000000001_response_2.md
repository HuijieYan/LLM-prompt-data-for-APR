## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

## Explanation
The bug in the original initialize function was that the logic for checking whether an IOLoop already exists and whether make_current is set to True was incorrect. This caused the failing test to raise a RuntimeError because the function was allowing a second IOLoop with make_current=True to be constructed when it shouldn't.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the logic inside the if-else statement in the initialize function should be corrected. The condition to raise a RuntimeError should be when make_current is set to True and an IOLoop already exists. Additionally, the condition for creating a new IOLoop with make_current=True should only be when an IOLoop doesn't already exist.

The corrected version of the function should address these issues and ensure that the failing test now passes.
