## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is causing the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" to be raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This is due to the incorrect logic flow in the conditional statements.

The issue on GitHub also points out the specific line (line 252) where the problem occurs and questions why the RuntimeError is being raised when the condition is None.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This will involve adjusting the conditional checks and the order of the conditional statements.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the variable `current_instance` to avoid calling it multiple times. Then, we adjust the conditional checks to ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when necessary.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
