The problem with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is that it is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is not checking if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to make the new instance current.

The test function `test_force_current` in the `ioloop_test.py` file is checking for this behavior by creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True` again. The test expects the second creation to fail with a `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check if a current instance already exists before trying to make the new instance current.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we check if `make_current` is `True` and if a current instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance, then we make the new instance current. If `make_current` is `False`, we don't attempt to make the new instance current.
