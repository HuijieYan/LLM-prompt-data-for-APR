The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` object and make it the current `IOLoop` if necessary. However, the issue seems to be with the logic of checking and setting the current `IOLoop`. 

The potential error is in the condition `if make_current is None`. When `make_current` is `True`, the logic should ensure that the current `IOLoop` exists and then set it as the current `IOLoop`. 

The cause of the bug is that the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect. Instead, it should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a valid `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly check if the current `IOLoop` exists and then set it as the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if not current_instance:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version checks if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance exists, and if not, it sets the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `None`, it also sets the current `IOLoop` if it doesn't exist.
