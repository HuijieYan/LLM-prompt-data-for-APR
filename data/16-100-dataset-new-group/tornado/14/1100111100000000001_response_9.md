## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # removed the condition 'elif make_current:'
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # changed the condition to check for existing IOLoop
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

## Analysis
The buggy function 'initialize' has a couple of issues:
1. The condition 'elif make_current:' is incorrect. It should simply be 'else:' to capture the case where 'make_current' is True or False.
2. The condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop is incorrect. It should check if the current IOLoop is not None rather than if it is None.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Remove the unnecessary condition check for 'make_current' and use 'else:' instead.
2. Change the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop to check if it is not None.

By making these changes, the function will accurately handle the initialization of the IOLoop.
