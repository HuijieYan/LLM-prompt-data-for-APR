The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current IOLoop, unless there is already a current instance. However, the issue arises when attempting to force the creation of a new IOLoop instance when one already exists.

The error message indicates that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` when attempting to force the current IOLoop, because a current IOLoop instance already exists. This means that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` inside the `else` block of the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the existing instance.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to check for the current IOLoop instance and only attempt to make the current IOLoop if it does not exist or if `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        if make_current:  # Only try to make the current IOLoop if needed
            self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the function will make the IOLoop current if it does not exist, and only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is set to `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
