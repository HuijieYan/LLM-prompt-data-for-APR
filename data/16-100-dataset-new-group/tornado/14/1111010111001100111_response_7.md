The buggy function `initialize` has an issue with the logic when `make_current` is `True`. The problem is that it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` because it should not create another current instance.

Based on the failing test `test_force_current`, it is expected that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the `IOLoop` instance should become the current instance and if another `IOLoop` instance tries to be created with `make_current=True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to accurately handle the cases when `make_current` is `None` and `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the logic for the `make_current=True` case has been fixed. It now checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` and raises a `RuntimeError` in that case. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
