To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `make_current` parameter is properly handled in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The issue seems to be with the logic for checking whether a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. 

It appears that the bug is causing the `initialize` function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` is passed, even if there is no current instance.

To fix the bug, I will modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `IOLoop` class and the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other parts of the class)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is True:
            current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With the corrected logic, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that the correct `RuntimeError` is raised only when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass successfully.

I recommend submitting the corrected code as a pull request to the GitHub repository to resolve the reported issue.
