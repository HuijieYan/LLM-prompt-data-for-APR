The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is set correctly. However, when the `make_current` argument is provided as `True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, even if it does not.

The reason for this bug is that the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and setting it as current is not correctly implemented.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. We need to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and only then set it as current.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class methods and attributes...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected function, the provided failing test `test_force_current` should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
