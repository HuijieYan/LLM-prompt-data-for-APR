The bug is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` method takes an argument `make_current` and is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance, making it the current IOLoop and raising an error if there is already a current instance.

The bug causing the failing test is that when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and raises an error if it exists. However, the condition for checking if a current instance already exists is incorrect, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the condition to check if a current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True` should be inverted. It should not raise an error if a current instance exists, and it should raise a RuntimeError if a current instance does not exist.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class and method declarations)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By reversing the condition for checking if a current IOLoop instance already exists, the bug is fixed, and the corrected version of the `initialize` method should now pass the failing test.
