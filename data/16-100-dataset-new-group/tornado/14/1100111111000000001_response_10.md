## Analysis:

The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop. It takes an optional argument `make_current` which is used to force the IOLoop to be the current IOLoop. However, the buggy function does not handle the `make_current` argument correctly, leading to the failing test.

## Identified Potential Error Location:

The potential error location is in the `initialize` function where the `make_current` argument is not handled properly.

## Cause of the Bug:

The bug occurs because the `make_current` argument is not checked correctly in the `initialize` function. The current logic does not cater to the case where `make_current` is True and the `IOLoop.current` is already existing.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

The bug can be fixed by checking the `make_current` argument properly and handling the cases where `IOLoop.current` already exists when `make_current` is True.

## Corrected Version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()

```

With the corrected version, the `make_current` argument is checked properly, and the cases where `IOLoop.current` already exists when `make_current` is True are handled correctly. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
