The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to be responsible for initializing the IOLoop, and the failing test `test_force_current` is testing the behavior when trying to make the IOLoop current when it already exists.

The potential error in the buggy function is in the logic for checking if the current IOLoop already exists. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should be checking if a current IOLoop instance exists, but it's currently only checking if it doesn't exist.

This causes the RuntimeError to be raised when trying to make the IOLoop current, even if it already exists, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when trying to make the IOLoop current if it already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`, we ensure that the RuntimeError will only be raised if the IOLoop already exists when trying to make it current.

This corrected version should resolve the issue with the failing test.
