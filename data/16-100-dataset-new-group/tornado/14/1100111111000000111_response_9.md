The bug appears to be in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The bug seems to be related to the conditional logic for `make_current`. Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, the bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which is conflicting with the conditional logic.

The strategy to fix the bug is to correct the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `None` and the case when it is `True`. Additionally, there is a missing return statement for `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is `None`. Therefore, the `initialize` function should be updated as follows:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class functions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                return self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
