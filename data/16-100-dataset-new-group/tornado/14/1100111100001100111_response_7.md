1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the file `ioloop.py` within the `tornado` module. It also calls the `current` and `make_current` functions from the same file.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function, specifically the conditions for `make_current`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance and creating a new one is incorrect. The conditional statements do not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This leads to the incorrect behavior of raising a `RuntimeError` when it should not.

4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the conditional statements handle all the possible cases for `make_current` and the current `IOLoop` instance.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods here

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first get the current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then, we check for the conditions based on the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True`, we check if the current instance is not `None` and raise a `RuntimeError` if so. If `make_current` is `False` or `None`, we check if the current instance is `None` and then call `self.make_current()` accordingly.

This corrected version addresses the GitHub issue by handling both cases of `make_current` and the current `IOLoop` instance correctly.
