## Explanation
The initialize function is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance, and it has a condition to check if the current IOLoop instance exists. However, the bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a RuntimeError when it shouldn't.

## Bug cause
The bug causes the function to raise a RuntimeError even when make_current is True, leading to a failure in the test_force_current test. This is because the function does not handle the make_current parameter correctly, resulting in the incorrect behavior.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the make_current parameter is handled properly. This includes checking if the current IOLoop instance exists based on the make_current parameter and only raising a RuntimeError when necessary.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function in ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Corrected condition
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Corrected condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version of the function, the make_current parameter is checked properly, and the RuntimeError is only raised when necessary. This corrected version should resolve the issue and make the test_force_current test pass.
