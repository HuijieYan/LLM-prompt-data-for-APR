### Bug Explanation
The buggy function has a logical error in the elif condition. When make_current is True, it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does. However, the intended behavior is to make the IOLoop current if it doesn't exist.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the elif condition should be modified to only make the IOLoop current if it doesn't already exist.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
