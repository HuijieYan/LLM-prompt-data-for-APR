### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop with the option to make it the current IOLoop. However, the bug occurs due to incorrect logic in handling the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the current IOLoop instance already exists and raise an error if it does. If not, it should make the current instance. Similarly, when `make_current` is `None`, it should only make the current instance if there is no current instance already.

### Bug Fix Strategy
Based on the bug explanation, the fix strategy involves:
1. Checking the condition for `make_current` and adjusting the logic accordingly.
2. Ensuring that the correct check is performed for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and handling the scenario accordingly.
3. Making sure the function adheres to the intended behavior for the `make_current` parameter.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods and documentation)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
The corrected version adjusts the conditional checks based on the `make_current` parameter and the existence of the current IOLoop instance. It ensures that the correct actions are taken based on the input parameter and the current state of the IOLoop.
