## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the original buggy function, the logic for checking if the IOLoop already exists is incorrect. We need to first check if `make_current` is None, and if so, then check if the IOLoop already exists and raise an error if it does. If `make_current` is True, then we need to first check if the IOLoop already exists and raise an error if it does, and only if it doesn't exist, then make it current.

The corrected version of the function includes the necessary checks and raises the RuntimeError if the IOLoop already exists.

The issue in the GitHub report is also addressed by updating the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the IOLoop already exists.

With the corrected function, the failing test `test_force_current` should now pass without any errors.
