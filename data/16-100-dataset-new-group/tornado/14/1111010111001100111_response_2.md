The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current IOLoop instance. However, the bug occurs when trying to enforce the current loop to become the current one even if there is already a current instance. The test function `test_force_current` expects the RuntimeError to be raised when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` if there is already a current instance.

The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when the `make_current` argument is set to None or True. In the case where `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance, the function incorrectly throws a RuntimeError.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these adjustments, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the logic for enforcing the current IOLoop instance without throwing unnecessary RuntimeErrors. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
