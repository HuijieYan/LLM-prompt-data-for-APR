### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if the current IOLoop exists and make it the current one if it doesn't. However, when `make_current` is `True`, the function erroneously raises a `RuntimeError` "current IOLoop already exists" even if it doesn't.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement that checks if the current IOLoop exists is incorrectly implemented, leading to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional statement that checks if the current IOLoop exists needs to be modified to accurately determine whether the current IOLoop already exists before making it the current one.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` has been modified to correctly check if the current IOLoop exists before attempting to make it the current one. This fix should resolve the bug and make the function behave as intended.
