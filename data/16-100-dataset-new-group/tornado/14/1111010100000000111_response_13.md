### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance, but it is not working as expected. The GitHub issue points out that there is a problem with the logic in the `initialize` function and specifically references line 252.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. `if make_current is None` condition may not be handling the current `IOLoop` instance correctly.
2. The logic to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raising `RuntimeError` seems to be flawed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is passed as `None` and when it is passed as `True`. The logic to check the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and raising the `RuntimeError` is not working as intended.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the condition to check the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `None`.
2. Update the logic to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance of `IOLoop` in a variable to avoid calling the `IOLoop.current` method multiple times. Then, the logic in the function is updated to correctly handle the cases when `make_current` is `None` or `True`. We check if the current instance exists and raise an error only when it is expected.
