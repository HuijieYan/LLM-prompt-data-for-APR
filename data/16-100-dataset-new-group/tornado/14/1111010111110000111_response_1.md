The cause of the bug is that in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the `IOLoop` instance is `None` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. However, the actual intention seems to be to check if the instance is not `None` before raising the `RuntimeError`.

The `test_force_current` test case is checking if a second construction of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` since the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The error message is indicating that it's raising a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a new `IOLoop` because `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which is unexpected.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking `make_current` should be modified in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class to correctly determine if a new `IOLoop` instance can be created with `make_current=True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` exists and raises the `RuntimeError` if it does. Otherwise, the method proceeds to make the new `IOLoop` instance the current one.
