The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop object by setting it as the current IOLoop if necessary. The issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists, even though it should be setting the current IOLoop in this case.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional check for `make_current` is incorrect. The function should set the current IOLoop if it does not exist, but it is incorrectly raising an error even when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current IOLoop only if it does not already exist. If it does exist, it should not raise an error.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            return  # Current IOLoop already exists, do nothing
        self.make_current()  # Set the current IOLoop
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and set the current IOLoop only if necessary, without raising an error when it already exists. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test.
