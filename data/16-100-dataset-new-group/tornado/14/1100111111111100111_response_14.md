The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing the failing test. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and results in the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error message.

The cause of the bug is that the logic inside the `initialize` function checks whether an IOLoop instance already exists, but it does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True`. When `make_current` is `True`, it incorrectly tries to create a new current IOLoop instance and then raises an error if it already exists.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `make_current` parameter is checked, and if it is `True`, it directly verifies if an IOLoop instance already exists using `IOLoop.current()`.

With this fix, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
