The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the failing test `test_force_current` to raise a `RuntimeError`. The issue seems to be related to the logic of checking for an already existing current IOLoop.

Upon analysis, the potential error location is identified in the `initialize` function in the conditional statement `if make_current:`.

The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised when the `make_current` flag is set to `True`, even if no current IOLoop exists. This is because the function is not properly checking if a current IOLoop already exists before raising the error.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement that checks for an already existing current IOLoop should be revised to only raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop exists and `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will check if a current IOLoop exists before attempting to make it current, and only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop is already present. This should resolve the issue and make the test `test_force_current` pass.
