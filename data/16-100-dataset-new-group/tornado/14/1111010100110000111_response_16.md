### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `initialize` function is raising a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists" when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is actually `None`. This does not match the expected behavior and is likely a bug.

### Error Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and the call to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should not raise a `RuntimeError` if the condition evaluates to `True`. This means something is not being handled correctly in the logic flow of the `initialize` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug fix strategy involves updating the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, it should proceed with setting the current IOLoop.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is kept the same as it's checking if a current IOLoop does not exist.
- In the `elif` block, the check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is updated to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to verify if a current IOLoop exists before raising an error.
- The corrected version takes care of the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current IOLoop actually exists.
