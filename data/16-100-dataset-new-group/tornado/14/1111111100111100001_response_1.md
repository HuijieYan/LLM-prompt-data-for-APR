### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object, and `make_current` is an optional parameter that decides whether the new IOLoop should become the current IOLoop. The function checks if there is already a current IOLoop and sets the new IOLoop as the current one, based on the value of `make_current`.

The failing test is indicating that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised, which implies that there is already a current IOLoop when `make_current` is set to True.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error is likely in the if-else condition inside the `initialize` function where it checks if a current IOLoop exists.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect logic inside the if-else condition. When `make_current` is set to True, the function should simply set the new IOLoop as the current one. However, the current logic first checks if a current IOLoop exists and then raises an error if one exists. This logic is incorrect.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The if-else condition should be simplified to directly set the new IOLoop as the current one if `make_current` is True, and not check for the existence of a current IOLoop separately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            self.make_current()
```
