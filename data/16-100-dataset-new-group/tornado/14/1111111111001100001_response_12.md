The bug in the `initialize` function is that the condition `if make_current is None` does not trigger when `make_current` is set to `True`. This causes the `make_current` method to always be called, even when it shouldn't be.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to check if `make_current` is not explicitly set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Changed the condition to explicitly check for True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test.
