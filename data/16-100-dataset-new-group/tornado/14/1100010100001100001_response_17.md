### Bug Explanation
The buggy function has an issue with the condition checking for the existence of the current IOLoop. It checks if the IOLoop exists, but it doesn't handle the case where make_current is True and the IOLoop already exists.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic to handle the case where make_current is True and the IOLoop already exists, and also remove the unnecessary check for None in the first conditional block.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
