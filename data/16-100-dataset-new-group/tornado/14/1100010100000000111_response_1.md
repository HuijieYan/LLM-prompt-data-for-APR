Potential Error Locations:
1. There seems to be an issue with the logic used to check whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not.
2. There may be an error in the conditional statements used to handle the make_current parameter.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the make_current parameter. The current logic does not properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raises a "already exists" error even when it is not the case.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to update the logic to properly handle the make_current parameter and check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before raising an error.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have first stored the value of IOLoop.current(instance=False) in a variable current_instance to avoid calling the function multiple times. Then, we have updated the conditional statements to properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before making any decisions.
