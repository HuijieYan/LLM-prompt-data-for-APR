The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` has a logical error in the conditional statements that check whether an IOLoop instance already exists. This is causing the test function `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` to fail, as it tries to test the force current functionality but encounters the RuntimeError.

The issue posted on GitHub indicates confusion about the logic on line 252 in `ioloop.py` and questions why the "already exists" error is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function should be adjusted. It should check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raise an error only if `make_current` is True and an instance already exists. If `make_current` is not provided, it should always make the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub. This fix ensures that the logic matches the intended behavior of creating or checking the current IOLoop instance.
