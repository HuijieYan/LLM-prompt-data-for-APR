To fix the bug in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, we need to ensure that the logic for setting the current IOLoop and raising an error is correctly implemented. The `initialize` method decides whether to make the IOLoop object the current instance based on the value of the `make_current` parameter passed to it. 

The logic in the buggy `initialize` method is incorrect because even if `make_current` is not specified, it's not properly checking the existence of a current IOLoop instance before calling `make_current`. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it should not raise an error if an instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # make_current is not None
        if make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version of the `initialize` method, we first check the existence of a current IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is not specified (i.e., it is `None`), we only make it the current instance if no IOLoop instance already exists. If `make_current` is specified, we raise an error if it is set to `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists; otherwise, we make it the current instance by calling `make_current`.

With this corrected implementation, the failing test should now pass without any errors.
