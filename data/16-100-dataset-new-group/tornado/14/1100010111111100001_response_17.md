The bug in the initialize function is causing the test_force_current test to fail. The initialize function should ensure that if make_current is True, the current IOLoop doesn't already exist.

The bug occurs because the initialize function doesn't correctly handle the case when make_current is True and the current IOLoop already exists. Instead of raising an error in this case, it mistakenly tries to make the current IOLoop again, causing the RuntimeError to be raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the initialize function to correctly handle the case when make_current is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function will correctly handle the case when make_current is True and the current IOLoop already exists, and the test_force_current test should pass.
