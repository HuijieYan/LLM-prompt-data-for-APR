The cause of the bug is that in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, the condition to check if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None is incorrectly implemented. This causes the error to be raised incorrectly even when the instance is not currently existing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the current instance of `IOLoop` is already existing or not.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False):
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we introduced an additional condition to first verify if `make_current` is True and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a non-None value. If this condition is met, then we raise the `RuntimeError`. If this condition does not satisfy, then we proceed to the next condition to check if `make_current` is True and initialize the current `IOLoop` instance.
