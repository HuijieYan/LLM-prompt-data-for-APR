The buggy function `initialize` is failing with the error message "RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is set to `True`. 

The buggy function `initialize` has a conditional statement that checks the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` and then calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is `True`, it again checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` and if not, raises a RuntimeError.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` because the conditional statement is incorrectly checking for the wrong condition. It should be checking if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, and then raise the RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement for `make_current` should be modified to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
