#### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop with an optional argument 'make_current' which defaults to None. If 'make_current' is True, it should check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does.

The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised when 'make_current' is True, which should not happen if the current IOLoop does not exist.

#### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to fix the condition that checks if the current IOLoop already exists when 'make_current' is set to True.

#### The corrected version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
