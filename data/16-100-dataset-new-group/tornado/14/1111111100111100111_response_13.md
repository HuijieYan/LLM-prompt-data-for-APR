The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised when `make_current` is `True`. The issue is related to the logic where it checks if the current `IOLoop` exists, and if it does, it raises an error.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` exists, and if it does, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists. The logic is incorrect because when `make_current` is `True`, it should not check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` and should directly set the current `IOLoop`.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` needs to be updated based on the value of `make_current`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True`, it directly sets the current `IOLoop` without checking for its existence, as this is the intended behavior when `make_current` is `True`. This modification directly addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and resolves the failing test case.
