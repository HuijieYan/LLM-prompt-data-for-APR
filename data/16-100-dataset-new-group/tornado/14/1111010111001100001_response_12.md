The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. It should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` before attempting to make the current `IOLoop`, and raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test.
