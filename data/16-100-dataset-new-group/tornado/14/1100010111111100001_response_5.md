The buggy function `initialize` is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. 
The test function `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempting to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the buggy function is not handling this case properly and is not throwing the `RuntimeError` as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks in the `initialize` function are not checking for the existing `IOLoop` instance correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance. We can modify the function to explicitly check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function will correctly check for the existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` and throw a `RuntimeError` if one already exists. This should fix the failing test.
