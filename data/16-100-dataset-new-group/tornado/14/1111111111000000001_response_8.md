### Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance and making it current if necessary. However, the bug seems to be related to the logic for handling the `make_current` argument.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `initialize` function logic for handling the `make_current` argument seems flawed.
2. The condition `if make_current is None` does not properly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None.
3. The condition `elif make_current` does not properly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class does not handle the `make_current` argument correctly. It incorrectly checks for the presence of an existing current instance and fails to raise an error when necessary. This leads to incorrect behavior, as observed in the failing test `test_force_current`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for handling the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function to ensure that the current instance is managed correctly.
2. Properly check for the existence of the current instance and raise an error if necessary.
3. Ensure that the `make_current` argument behaves as described in the class documentation.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The `initialize` function now properly checks for the existence of the current instance based on the `make_current` argument and raises an error when necessary.

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now work as expected and pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
