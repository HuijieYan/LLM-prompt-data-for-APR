## Corrected version of the buggy function

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

## Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` function is that the logic for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is incorrect. The issue arises from the incorrect condition in the `if` statement. The logic should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None when `make_current` is True, and if it is None when `make_current` is None or False.

The failing test `test_force_current` highlights the issue by trying to construct a new IOLoop with `make_current=True`, which should result in a `RuntimeError` since the current IOLoop already exists. However, the existing logic does not raise the error as expected.

To fix the bug, the condition in the `initialize` function needs to be changed to correctly check whether the current IOLoop instance is None or not when `make_current` is True or False, and raise a `RuntimeError` accordingly.

The corrected version of the function provides the fix by changing the condition in the `if` and `elif` statements to accurately check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

After making the suggested changes, the `initialize` function should work as expected and pass the failing test.
