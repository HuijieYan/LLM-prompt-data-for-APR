The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance with an optional parameter `make_current`, which is intended to make the current IOLoop instance. However, the error message indicates that the code is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is `True`.

Based on the code and the error message, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of the `make_current` parameter. The conditional statements in the `initialize` function are not effectively checking the existing state of the IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements should be modified to properly check and handle the cases where `make_current` is `True` or `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # No need to explicitly check for make_current=True, as it's the only other possible value
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None and make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True` and avoid raising the incorrect `RuntimeError`.
