The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the bug causes it to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The cause of the bug is that the code inside the `initialize` function is incorrectly checking if the current IOLoop instance exists. If `make_current` is `True`, it expects the current IOLoop to already exist, and therefore raises a `RuntimeError` if it doesn't.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. We need to make sure that it attempts to make the current IOLoop and only raise a `RuntimeError` if it fails.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        try:
            self.make_current()
        except RuntimeError:
            raise
```
With this correction, the `initialize` function will attempt to make the IOLoop current if `make_current` is `True`, and if it fails, it will raise a `RuntimeError` as expected.
