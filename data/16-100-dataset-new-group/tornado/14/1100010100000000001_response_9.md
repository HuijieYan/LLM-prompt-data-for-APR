## Analysis
The buggy function has a conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. If it is, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if it is True, and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it raises a RuntimeError. The bug might be in the conditional logic and the handling of the `make_current` argument.

## Identified Errors
1. The condition `if make_current is None` should also check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before calling `self.make_current()`.
2. The condition `elif make_current:` should directly call `self.make_current()` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, instead of checking again for its presence.
3. The handling of the `make_current` argument seems redundant and can be improved.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the function occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument. It does not cover all possible cases to ensure that `self.make_current()` is called appropriately.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Adjust the conditional logic to cover all cases where `self.make_current()` should be called.
2. Simplify the handling of the `make_current` argument to avoid unnecessary code.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    if make_current or IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```
