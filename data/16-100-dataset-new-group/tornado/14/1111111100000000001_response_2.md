The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. It is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance, including setting it as the current `IOLoop` if necessary.

The potential error locations in the function are the two conditional blocks that check if `make_current` is None and if `make_current` is True.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is None, the logic inside the conditional block does not set the current `IOLoop` instance correctly. Additionally, the logic within the `elif make_current` block does not handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that if `make_current` is None, the function should always call `self.make_current()` to set the current `IOLoop` instance. Additionally, when `make_current` is True, the function should check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raise an error if it does.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
