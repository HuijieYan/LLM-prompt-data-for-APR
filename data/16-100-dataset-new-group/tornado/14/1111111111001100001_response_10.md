The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is failing the test `test_force_current`.

The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current `IOLoop` already exists and if not, it should make itself the current `IOLoop`. However, the current implementation of the function does not handle this case correctly, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, it should first check if the current `IOLoop` already exists, and if not, it should make itself the current `IOLoop`. If the current `IOLoop` already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError` as shown in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test.
