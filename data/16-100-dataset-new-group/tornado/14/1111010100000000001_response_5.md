The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class has a potential error in the conditional logic and method calls that may lead to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and whether to make the current `IOLoop` can lead to contradictory operations based on the `make_current` parameter.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic and avoid using the `self.make_current()` method directly. Instead, we can use the `IOLoop.current` method to handle the logic for making the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class definitions and documentation)

    def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current and current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
        elif current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance, in which case we raise a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance, or if `make_current` is `False`, we then call `self.make_current()` accordingly.
