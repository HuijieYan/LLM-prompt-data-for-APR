The bug in the `initialize` function is that it doesn't handle the case when `make_current` is set to `False`. The function only checks for `None` and `True` values of `make_current`, but it should also consider the case when it's set to `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to add an additional `elif` statement to handle the case when `make_current` is `False`. In this case, it should not try to become the current `IOLoop`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:
        pass  # do nothing
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will handle the case when `make_current` is set to `False` and not attempt to become the current `IOLoop`.
