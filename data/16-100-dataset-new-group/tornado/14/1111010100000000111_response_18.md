## Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class has a bug that fails to correctly check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to True.

## Error Location:
The error is present in the `initialize` function where it does not properly handle the cases when `make_current` is None or True.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code fails to properly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to True. As a result, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when the `IOLoop` instance is not present.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases when `make_current` is None or True. We need to ensure that the existing `IOLoop` instance is correctly checked before attempting to make the new `IOLoop` current.

## Corrected Version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods and attributes)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current `IOLoop` instance in the variable `current_instance` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then, based on the value of `make_current`, we correctly check if the current instance exists or not and raise the `RuntimeError` only if necessary. This approach ensures that the bug is fixed and the function behaves as intended.
