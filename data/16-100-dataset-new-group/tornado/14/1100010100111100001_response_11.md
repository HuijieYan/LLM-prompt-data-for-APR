### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to the logic for checking whether the current IOLoop exists or not. It should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists. The current logic seems to be incorrect in handling this condition.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could be to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop and raise an error only when necessary.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function checks for the existence of the current IOLoop and raises an error only if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists. This should address the issue mentioned in the failing test.
