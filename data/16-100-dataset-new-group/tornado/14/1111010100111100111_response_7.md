The potential error location in the buggy function is the conditional statement that checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and then raises a RuntimeError if make_current is True.

The bug in the initialize function of the IOLoop class is caused by the incorrect logic inside the function. When make_current is True, it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if it does, it raises a RuntimeError. However, the logic is incorrectly implemented, and it should only raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop instance does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the initialize function to correctly handle the make_current parameter. If make_current is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists, it should not raise a RuntimeError. Instead, it should proceed as normal. If make_current is True and the current IOLoop instance does not exist, it should then make the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
```

This updated logic checks if make_current is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists. If so, it returns without raising a RuntimeError. If make_current is True and the current IOLoop instance does not exist, it makes the current IOLoop.
