Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the buggy function is the `initialize` method, particularly in the block handling the `make_current` argument.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method checks if there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance, but it does not correctly handle the case where there is no current instance and `make_current` is specified as `True`. This leads to a RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to explicitly check if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance before making the new `IOLoop` instance the current one, and then remove the unnecessary `if` conditions for `None` checks.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` method should now correctly handle the `make_current` argument.

This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
