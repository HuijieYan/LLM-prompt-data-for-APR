The bug in the `initialize` function is that it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before calling `make_current`, but it doesn't actually make a new instance if one doesn't exist.

To fix the bug, we should add the logic to create a new `IOLoop` instance if one doesn't already exist when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is None:
            new_instance = IOLoop()
            new_instance.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

This correction adds the logic to create a new instance of `IOLoop` if it doesn't already exist when `make_current` is `True`. If an instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` as before.
