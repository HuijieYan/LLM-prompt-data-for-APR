The `initialize` method from the `IOLoop` class tries to check whether there is a current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if there is a current `IOLoop`. The test `test_force_current` instantiates an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and then expects that a second instantiation should raise a `RuntimeError` because there is already a current `IOLoop` in use.

The problem with the `initialize` method is that it uses `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check for the presence of a current `IOLoop`. The `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` internally falls back to `IOLoop.current()`, which is calling itself infinitely, causing a stack overflow and eventually leading to the error that a current `IOLoop` already exists.

To fix this issue, the `initialize` method should use an internal flag to check for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instead of calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if hasattr(self, '_current_instance') and self._current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if hasattr(self, '_current_instance') and self._current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we introduced a new internal attribute `_current_instance` to the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is not passed, it checks if `_current_instance` is None, and if so, it makes the instance current. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if `_current_instance` is not None, and if so, raises a `RuntimeError`. This way, it reliably checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` without causing an infinite loop.
