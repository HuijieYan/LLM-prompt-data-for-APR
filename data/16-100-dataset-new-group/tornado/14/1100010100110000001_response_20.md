The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists". The bug occurs when the `make_current` variable is set to True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance. If it already exists, the function should not raise an error.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return  # Do nothing if current IOLoop already exists
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will only attempt to make the IOLoop instance the current one if it does not already exist. This should fix the bug and prevent the RuntimeError from occurring.
