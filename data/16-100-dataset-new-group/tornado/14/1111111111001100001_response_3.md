### Analyzing the bug
The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug seems to be in the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, otherwise it should set the current `IOLoop` instance. However, the current logic does not handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is `None`.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `None` and a current `IOLoop` already exists. In this case, the function does not attempt to set the current `IOLoop` instance, which leads to unexpected behavior.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter when it is `None`. If a current `IOLoop` instance exists, the function should not attempt to set the current instance again, as it is unnecessary. We can achieve this by removing the `self.make_current()` call within the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        # Remove the following line
        # self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and pass the failing test.
