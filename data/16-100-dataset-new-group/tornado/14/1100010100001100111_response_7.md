## Analyzing the buggy function

The `initialize` function seems to check if the `make_current` parameter is None or True and then checks if the current IOLoop instance exists before either creating a new one or raising a RuntimeError.

### Potential error locations
1. The condition `if make_current is None` may not be working as expected.
2. The condition `if make_current` may not be working as expected.

### Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter and the condition checks for the current IOLoop instance. The GitHub issue suggests that the code may not be handling the existing IOLoop instance correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditions for checking for an existing IOLoop instance are correctly implemented. Additionally, the handling of the `make_current` parameter needs to be reviewed to ensure it is working as expected.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current IOLoop instance in a variable and then use that variable to check for its existence. This ensures that the correct instance is being checked and the conditions for creating or raising an error are handled accurately.
