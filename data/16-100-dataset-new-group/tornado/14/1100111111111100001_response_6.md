The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the failing test `test_force_current` to raise a `RuntimeError`. 

The issue seems to be with the logic inside the `initialize` function. 
- When `make_current` is `True`, the function is checking if the current IOLoop exists, and if it does, it is raising a `RuntimeError`.
- However, the function is also calling `self.make_current()` in the same condition, which might be leading to the creation of a new IOLoop instance and causing the error.

To fix this bug, we should only call `self.make_current()` if the current IOLoop does not exist. Also, we should remove the check for the current IOLoop in the `elif` condition where `make_current` is `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this update, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
