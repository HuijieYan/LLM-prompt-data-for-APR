The buggy function `initialize` has a logical error in the condition checking for `make_current`. The `make_current` should not be set if it's already initialized and a `RuntimeError` should be raised in this case.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, and the `IOLoop.current()` already exists. This should raise a `RuntimeError` as expected, but it is not handled correctly in the `initialize` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking for `make_current` and handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists.

Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test.
