The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class seems to be related to the logic for checking the current instance of the `IOLoop` and whether to make it the current instance. 

The 'initialize' function checks the value of the `make_current` parameter and makes a decision based on the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and whether to call `self.make_current()` or raise a `RuntimeError`.

The failing test case `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then checks if it becomes the current instance and whether subsequent attempts to create a new current instance will fail.

The issue reported on GitHub questions why a `RuntimeError` is raised after checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

The bug seems to be in the logic of the `initialize` function where it incorrectly checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and based on that it either calls `self.make_current()` or raises a `RuntimeError`. The bug potentially lies in the conditional statements within the function.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or `False`, and ensure that the behavior aligns with the intended functionality.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we fixed the condition for checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test to pass.
