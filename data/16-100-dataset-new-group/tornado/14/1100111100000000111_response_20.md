## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then either creates a new one or raises an error if one already exists. The issue on GitHub suggests that there is a problem with the logic at line 252, where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and then raises an error if it is not None.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is within the conditional statements that check if the `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is contradictory. It checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if it is not None, it raises an error. This is logically incorrect and causes the bug.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted so that it only raises an error if the `IOLoop` instance already exists and should not create a new one if it does.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions remain the same

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the conditional statements have been inverted to properly check if the `IOLoop` instance exists and then either raise an error or create a new one based on the condition.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub by fixing the contradictory logic in the `initialize` function.
