The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module. The purpose of this method is to initialize the IOLoop instance and potentially make it the current IOLoop.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used without importing the `IOLoop` class or specifying the class from which the `current` method is being called.
2. The `self.make_current()` method is called without an explicit definition of what it does.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect usage of the `IOLoop.current` method and the `make_current` method. The `current` method is likely intended to be called from the `IOLoop` class itself, and the `make_current` method needs to be defined or imported correctly.

To fix the bug, the `IOLoop` class should be imported if it's in a different module, and the `current` and `make_current` methods should be properly defined or imported from the `IOLoop` class.

Corrected version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function with the necessary import and method definitions

from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current_instance()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current_instance()

    def make_current_instance(self):
        # Define the behavior of making the IOLoop current
        pass
```

In this corrected version, the appropriate import statement is included for the `IOLoop` class, and the method `make_current_instance` is added and defined as needed by the application to make the IOLoop current.
