The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance. However, it fails to handle the case when the current instance is already initialized, leading to a RuntimeError.

The potential error location is at line 253 where the function raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and the current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly check if the current instance of `IOLoop` already exists before attempting to initialize a new one. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised when a new instance is initialized with `make_current=True`.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to make it current. If it already exists, it should not raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this fix, the function will correctly check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to make it current. This should resolve the RuntimeError and make the failing test pass.
