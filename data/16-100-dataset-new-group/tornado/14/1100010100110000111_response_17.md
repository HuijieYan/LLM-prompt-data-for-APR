## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is checking if the current IOLoop instance exists and then raising a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True. The error message and the GitHub issue both point to this specific line of code as the source of the bug.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect check for the current IOLoop instance. The function should not raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop instance exists and `make_current` is True. Instead, it should set the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't exist.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks for the current IOLoop instance and the `make_current` flag. If `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance exists, we should set the current IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance doesn't exist, we should raise the RuntimeError.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle the `make_current` flag and the existence of the current IOLoop instance. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to work as intended.
