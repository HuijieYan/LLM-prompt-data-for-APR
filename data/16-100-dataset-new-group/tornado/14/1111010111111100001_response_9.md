The issue with the buggy initialize function is that it is not properly checking whether a current IOLoop already exists before trying to make itself the current loop. This is leading to the RuntimeError being incorrectly raised, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the initialize function to correctly check for the existence of a current IOLoop before attempting to make itself the current loop.

Here is the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the initialize function, it correctly checks for the existence of a current IOLoop before attempting to make itself the current loop. This should address the issue and the failing test should now pass.
