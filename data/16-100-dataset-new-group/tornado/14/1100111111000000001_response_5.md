The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. It checks if the `make_current` argument is None, and if so, it calls the `make_current` method. However, if the `make_current` argument is not None and evaluates to True, it raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, and then calls the `make_current` method.

The problem here is that when `make_current` is True, the `initialize` method should simply call the `make_current` method without checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This check is redundant in this case and is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be modified to simply call the `make_current` method if `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # Other methods and functions...

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            self.make_current()
```
This should fix the bug and the test "test_force_current" should pass now.
