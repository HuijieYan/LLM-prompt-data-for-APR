## Corrections
After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue is with the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` method is supposed to handle the current `IOLoop` instance, but it seems to be causing issues in the test case `test_force_current` where it fails when trying to make the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `initialize` method seems to stem from the logic for handling the `make_current` argument. It is not handling the possible scenarios correctly, leading to failures in the test case. It is also apparent that the GitHub issue is pointing out that the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None` and hence the the error "current IOLoop already exists" should not be raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `initialize` method should be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the check for the existing `IOLoop` instance. It should ensure that it only raises an error if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the logic has been modified to properly handle the `make_current` argument. If `make_current` is `True`, then it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` before raising an error. This should resolve the issue and make the failing tests pass.
