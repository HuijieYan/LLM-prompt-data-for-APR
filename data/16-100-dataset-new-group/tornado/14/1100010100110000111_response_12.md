## Corrected version of the function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The issue with the original code is in the `initialize` function, specifically with the condition `if make_current` and the subsequent check for the existence of the current IOLoop. The error message indicates that the current IOLoop already exists, which contradicts the previous check for its existence.

By modifying the condition `elif make_current` to `else` in the corrected version, we ensure that the intended logic is followed. Additionally, the check for the existence of the current IOLoop is adjusted to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to accurately identify the current IOLoop's presence. This resolves the issue and ensures that the function operates as intended.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
