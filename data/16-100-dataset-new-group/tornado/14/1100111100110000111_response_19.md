The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class of `tornado/ioloop.py` is causing an issue. The function is intended to initialize the IOLoop, but it fails to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

The issue is with the logic that checks if the current IOLoop already exists. This logic is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

The error message from the failing test indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when a current IOLoop instance exists.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function should be updated to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the updated version, the condition for checking if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists is modified. This modification ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and there is an existing IOLoop instance.

With this corrected version, the issue described in the GitHub post should be resolved and the failing test should pass.
