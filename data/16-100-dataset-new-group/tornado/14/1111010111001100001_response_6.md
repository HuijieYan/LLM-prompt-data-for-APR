The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance with the option to force it to become the current instance. However, the function is incorrectly handling the `make_current` parameter.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if not, then make the current instance. However, the current implementation of the function does not correctly handle this logic.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance if `make_current` is `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test.
