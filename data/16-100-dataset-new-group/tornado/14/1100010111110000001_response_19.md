The buggy function `initialize` is checking for the existence of the current IOLoop and attempting to make it the current IOLoop if no current IOLoop exists. However, there is a bug in the logic for when `make_current` is True, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect. When `make_current` is True, the function should create a new IOLoop instance and make it the current IOLoop. If a current IOLoop already exists, it should raise the RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter to correctly handle the case when it is True.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this fix, the function will correctly create a new IOLoop instance and make it the current IOLoop when `make_current` is True, and it will correctly raise a RuntimeError if a current IOLoop already exists.
