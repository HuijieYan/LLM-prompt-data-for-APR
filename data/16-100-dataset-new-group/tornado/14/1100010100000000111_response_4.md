Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` could be the cause of the bug.
2. The `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` statement might not be getting executed as intended.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to occur in the `initialize` function at line 252 of the `ioloop.py` file in the `tornado` package. The issue is questioning why the code is raising an error stating "current IOLoop already exists" when the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is true. This indicates that the program logic might not be working correctly, which is causing the bug.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition is being evaluated correctly and that the appropriate action is taken based on the result. Additionally, we need to ensure that the error is raised only when the condition for the existence of the current IOLoop is met.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In this corrected version, we store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance` and then use this variable to check whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not. We have also adjusted the condition for raising the `RuntimeError` to ensure it is only raised when the current IOLoop already exists.
