The buggy function `initialize` is meant to initialize the IOLoop class, making the current IOLoop the current instance if `make_current` is True and there is no current instance already. If `make_current` is None, it will also make the current IOLoop the current instance if there is no current instance already.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. In the `if make_current is None` block, the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might not be evaluating as expected.
2. In the `elif make_current` block, the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the call to `self.make_current()` might not be functioning correctly.

The cause of the bug may be due to the evaluation of the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` not behaving as expected, which could result in the incorrect handling of the current IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, we can update the condition checks and handling of the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the condition checks to handle the current IOLoop instance correctly and ensure that the `make_current` method is only called when necessary.
