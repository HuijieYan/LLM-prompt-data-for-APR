### Analysis
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance, but it has a bug where it does not handle the `make_current=True` parameter properly. This bug causes the test function `test_force_current` to fail because it expects the `IOLoop` instance to raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a new instance with `make_current=True` after the initial instance has already been set as the current instance.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the mishandling of the `make_current=True` parameter in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, the function should check if the `IOLoop` is already the current instance and raise a `RuntimeError` if it is. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to properly check if the `IOLoop` is already the current instance and raise an error if `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class members)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

### Corrected Version Explanation
In the corrected version, an additional check is added to handle the `make_current=True` parameter. If `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it immediately raises a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, if `make_current=True`, it sets the current instance. This change ensures that the function handles the `make_current` parameter correctly and passes the failing test.
