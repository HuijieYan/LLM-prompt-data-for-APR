The bug in the initialize function of the IOLoop class is that it checks for the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and if it is True, it raises a RuntimeError, even if make_current is set to True. This contradicts the behavior described in the documentation and also does not align with the intended logic.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should only raise a RuntimeError if make_current is True, indicating that the current IOLoop instance should already exist. However, in the current implementation, it raises the error unconditionally.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic to raise a RuntimeError only if make_current is True and the IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None. This will align with the intended behavior and also be consistent with the documentation.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function will correctly handle the make_current argument and avoid raising a RuntimeError when it is not necessary.

This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and also make the failing test "test_force_current" pass.
