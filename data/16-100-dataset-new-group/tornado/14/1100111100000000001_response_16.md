The buggy function `initialize` has a bug in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition is checking if `current` method of the `IOLoop` class is `None`, but it should be checking if the `make_current` method of the same class is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to `if self.make_current is None`. Also, we need to remove the unnecessary `instance` parameter in the `current` method of the `IOLoop` class.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.make_current is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.make_current is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, we can ensure that the correct method is being called and the bug in the original function is resolved.
