The cause of the bug is that the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function is being used incorrectly. The `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function expects a boolean value to control whether the new `IOLoop` will always try to become current or not. However, in the buggy version, it is using `None` and `instance=False` both of which are incorrect.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to use proper boolean values for the `make_current` argument, ensuring that it follows the expected behavior as described in the `IOLoop` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions and class details)

    def initialize(self, make_current=False):
        if make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `make_current` argument now follows the intended behavior, using boolean values to check for the existing current instance of `IOLoop` and making the current instance if necessary. When the failing test is run with this corrected version, it should pass without raising a `RuntimeError` for the existing current `IOLoop`.
