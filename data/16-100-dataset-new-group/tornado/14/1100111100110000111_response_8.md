The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when it shouldn't. The issue is related to the logic used to check if an IOLoop instance already exists.

The issue is with the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` inside the `initialize` function. This condition is used to check if an IOLoop instance already exists, but it is not working as expected, as it still raises a `RuntimeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not correctly evaluating whether an IOLoop instance already exists or not. The logic is flawed, leading to the incorrect raising of the `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, we can directly check if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists, and raise the `RuntimeError` in that case. Additionally, we can refactor the logic to make it more readable and ensure that the check for the existing IOLoop instance is correct.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
