## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the conditional statements where the current IOLoop is checked and the RuntimeError is raised.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the initialize function arises from the incorrect handling of the make_current parameter and the condition for raising a RuntimeError. When make_current is not provided, it checks if the current IOLoop is None and then calls self.make_current(). However, if make_current is provided and True, it still checks if the current IOLoop is None and raises a RuntimeError with the message "current IOLoop already exists", which is contradictory.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by ensuring consistent handling of the make_current parameter and the condition for raising a RuntimeError. When make_current is True, the function should raise a RuntimeError only if the current IOLoop exists. If make_current is not provided, it should perform the check for the current IOLoop and call self.make_current() if it doesn't exist.

## Corrected Version

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
