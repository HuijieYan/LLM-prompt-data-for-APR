## Analysis
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class has a bug that causes it to raise a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. This behavior is not consistent with the expected logic.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error is in the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function that checks the value of `make_current`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the logic inside the conditional statements does not correctly handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. This leads to the incorrect raising of a `RuntimeError` in certain cases, as identified in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. The conditional statements should be adjusted to reflect the intended behavior.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the function first retrieves the value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and stores it in the `current_instance` variable. Then, the conditional statements are modified to check whether `current_instance` is `None` or not, as per the specified logic. This ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `current_instance` is not `None` and `make_current` is `True`.
