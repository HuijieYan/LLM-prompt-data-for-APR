### Correction:

The issue in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument. The logic inside the `initialize` function is flawed, resulting in the incorrect handling of the current IOLoop instance, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when it should not.

It appears that the intention of the `initialize` function is to create a new IOLoop instance and make it the current instance if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the current implementation is not working as expected, as it is incorrectly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and avoid raising a `RuntimeError` in cases where it is not necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above change, the behavior of the `initialize` function will correctly handle the `make_current` argument and will ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.

This modification will address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the failing test for `force_current` passes without raising a `RuntimeError`.
