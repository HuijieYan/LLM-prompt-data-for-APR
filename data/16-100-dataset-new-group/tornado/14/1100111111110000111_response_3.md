The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is causing an issue where it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` is passed in the constructor. The issue is causing the failing test in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` where the `test_force_current` test fails with the error message indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

The cause of the bug is in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True` is passed, the code checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If it is not `None`, it should raise an error. However, the check is incorrectly implemented.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then raise the `RuntimeError` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions and class declarations

    def initialize(self, make_current=False):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `make_current` is the same as the original but the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is replaced by `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` and the order of these checks is inverted. This change ensures that the error is correctly raised when the current IOLoop already exists.

With the corrected version of the `initialize` function, the failing test in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` should pass, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
