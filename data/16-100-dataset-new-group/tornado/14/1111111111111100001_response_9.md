The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the conditional statement for handling the `make_current` parameter. The bug is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised even when it shouldn't be.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement for `make_current` does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement needs to be adjusted to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:  # Changed to handle the case when make_current is True
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and pass the failing test.
