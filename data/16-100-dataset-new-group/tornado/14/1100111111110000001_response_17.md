The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class causes the failing test `test_force_current` to raise a `RuntimeError` when attempting to initialize the `io_loop` with `make_current=True`.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class does not correctly handle the `make_current` argument. It incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop instance is already existing during the initialization process, without taking into account the `make_current` parameter. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` method to handle the `make_current` parameter properly. 

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # ... (other methods)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current == True:
            IOLoop.instance = self
        elif make_current == False:
            IOLoop.instance = None
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we introduce an `IOLoop.instance` attribute to keep track of the current IOLoop instance. When `make_current` is `True`, we update the `IOLoop.instance` attribute to the current instance. When `make_current` is `False`, we remove the current instance. For all other cases, we check if the current IOLoop instance exists and if not, we make the current instance.

With this corrected version of the `initialize` method, the failing test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
