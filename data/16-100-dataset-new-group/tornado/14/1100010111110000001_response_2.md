It appears that the bug is in the 'initialize' function of the IOLoop class. The problem is that when 'make_current' is set to True, it is checking if there is already a current instance of IOLoop, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError. However, this check is incorrect as it's not properly handling the case where 'make_current' is True and there is no current instance of IOLoop.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the 'initialize' function to properly handle the case when 'make_current' is True and there is no current instance of IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the 'initialize' function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the 'initialize' function will first check if 'make_current' is True and there is no current instance of IOLoop. If so, it will create the current instance. If there is already a current instance, it will raise a RuntimeError, as expected.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test to pass.
