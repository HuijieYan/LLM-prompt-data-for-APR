The bug is likely in the 'initialize' method of the IOLoop class. The initialize method takes 'make_current' as an argument, and the error message indicates that there is an issue with the current IOLoop already existing. 

The bug is likely caused by the 'if' statement not handling the "make_current" argument correctly and not checking the current IOLoop correctly. It should either set a new current IOLoop or raise an error if there's already a current instance.

To fix the bug, we should modify the 'initialize' method to explicitly handle the cases where 'make_current' is None and when it is True. It should first check if there is already a current IOLoop and initialize a new one only if there isn't.

Here is the corrected version of the 'initialize' method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This fix ensures that the 'make_current' parameter is handled correctly and raises an error if there is already a current IOLoop.
