## Analysis
The buggy function initialize() is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop, but it is failing to do so based on the failing test test_force_current(). The test is expecting a RuntimeError to be raised when a second make_current=True construction is attempted, but the function does not behave as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The condition check for make_current=None might not be working as intended.
2. The logic for handling the make_current parameter could be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug
The failing test scenario is when a second IOLoop instance is being created with make_current=True. The buggy function initialize() fails to properly handle this case and does not raise the expected RuntimeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to modify the code to properly handle the make_current parameter and ensure that it raises a RuntimeError when a second IOLoop instance is created with make_current=True.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the condition for make_current=True to properly check if IOLoop.current() is not None and raise a RuntimeError if it already exists.

This corrected version should address the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
