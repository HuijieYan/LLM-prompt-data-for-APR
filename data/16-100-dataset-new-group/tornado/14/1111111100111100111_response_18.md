To fix the bug, we need to address the issue with the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. The problem lies in the conditional logic inside the `initialize` method, which is incorrectly checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect condition check in the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the code checks if there is no current IOLoop instance and then raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists. This is contradictory and leads to the failure of the test.

To resolve the bug, we need to modify the condition check in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:  # Check if make_current is explicitly set to True
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if `make_current` is set to `True`, and then proceed to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. If the current IOLoop already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`, it will raise a `RuntimeError` as expected.

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the issue raised on GitHub should be resolved.
