The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance. It takes an optional parameter `make_current` which, when set to `True`, should make the current `IOLoop` instance, and when set to `False`, should not try to make the current instance.

The potential error in the function is in the condition `if make_current is None`, where it checks if `make_current` is `None` and then proceeds to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. This logic does not match the intended behavior described in the documentation.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current is None` should not be checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, but rather if the `make_current` argument is `True` or `False`.

To fix the bug, the condition `if make_current is None` needs to be changed to `if make_current is not None and make_current is True`. This will correctly check if `make_current` is `True` and then proceed to make the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None and make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
