The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is throwing a RuntimeError: "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is set to True. This error occurs when there's already an instance of the `IOLoop` class set as the current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to True and there's already an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if `make_current` is None. If it is, then it checks if there's no existing current `IOLoop` instance before making the current instance. If `make_current` is True, it checks if there's already an existing current `IOLoop` instance, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError.

By making these changes, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to True and the existing current `IOLoop` instance. This should resolve the RuntimeError that was being thrown in the failing test.
