The issue is related to the IOLoop class's `initialize` method in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The failing test is `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`. The failing error message is about "current IOLoop already exists".

The problem with the buggy function is that it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and then proceeds with other operations. However, the logic seems to be incorrect as it raises a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists, which contradicts the prior check for None.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where the current IOLoop already exists.

One approach to fixing the bug is to change the condition block for `make_current` to handle existing IOLoop in a separate if condition before creating a new IOLoop instance.

The corrected version of the `initialize` method in `tornado/ioloop.py`:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop exists is changed to be more explicit, and the error message should be resolved.

By making this change, the corrected version of the `initialize` method should now pass the failing test and also resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
