The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file has a conditional statement to handle the variable `make_current`, which is passed as an argument to the function. The goal is to make the current `IOLoop` instance, or raise `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`.

The test function `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then tries to create another one with the same argument to check if the `RuntimeError` is raised as expected.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is not being raised as expected when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with the same `make_current=True`.

The potential error lies in the conditional statement inside the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. Specifically, the issue is with the logic that checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raises the `RuntimeError` when it should.

To fix the bug, the condition should check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance. If these conditions are met, it should raise the `RuntimeError`. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, the `if` statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` checks if there is no `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `None` and `self.make_current()` method is called.

The second `if` statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` checks if there is an `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` and will raise the `RuntimeError` as required.

With this corrected implementation, the `initialize` function should now pass the `test_force_current` test case without raising any `RuntimeError`.
