## Analysis
The `initialize` function is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug seems to be related to the logic for checking if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. The failing test `test_force_current` shows that a second call to `IOLoop(make_current=True)` raises a `RuntimeError`, indicating that the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is not working as intended.

The GitHub issue points to the specific line of code (line 252) where the issue is occurring. It questions why the `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.

## Error Location
The potential error locations within the buggy function seem to be:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the subsequent `raise RuntimeError` statement.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect. It does not correctly determine whether an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. This results in the `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously, leading to failing tests and the raised GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug would be to correct the logic for checking whether an instance of `IOLoop` already exists before attempting to make it the current `IOLoop`. This can be achieved by using a different conditional check that accurately determines the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the conditional checks have been inverted to accurately determine if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists before attempting to make it current. This correction should address the bug and make the failing test pass while resolving the GitHub issue.
