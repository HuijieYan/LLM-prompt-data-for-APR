After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, related functions, and the GitHub issue, here's the potential error in the buggy function:
- The `initialize` function is checking for the current instance of the `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and then based on the result, it either makes the current instance or raises an error. The issue mentioned in the GitHub problem statement is that the function is raising an error even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which means that there is no current instance of the `IOLoop`. The function should only raise an error if a current instance already exists, but it is incorrectly raising the error even when there is no current instance.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to modify the conditional checks for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and how the error is raised when `make_current` is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, a new variable `current_instance` is used to store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` at the beginning of the function. The conditional checks for `make_current` and the existence of the current instance are modified based on this variable. The error is raised only when a current instance exists and `make_current` is True, as intended.
