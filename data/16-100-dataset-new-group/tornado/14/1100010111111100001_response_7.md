The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance, and if `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current IOLoop instance. The failing test `test_force_current` is supposed to initialize an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then check if it raises a `RuntimeError` when attempting to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.

The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when attempting to create a second IOLoop instance. This suggests that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is not working as intended.

The cause of the bug is that the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance exists is not functioning correctly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance exists should be modified to accurately determine if it already exists, and raise the RuntimeError only if it does.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass as the condition for checking if the current IOLoop exists has been fixed.
