The bug in the `initialize` function is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`. The logic to check if a current `IOLoop` already exists is incorrect, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly checking if a current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current=True`. The conditional logic in the `initialize` function is flawed, leading to the erroneous `RuntimeError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic to correctly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` when `make_current=True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        existing_current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if existing_current is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if existing_current is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The corrected version checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` before attempting to make a new `IOLoop` current when `make_current=True`. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
