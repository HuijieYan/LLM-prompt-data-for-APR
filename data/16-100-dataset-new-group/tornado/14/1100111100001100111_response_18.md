The buggy function `initialize` in the IOLoop class should check if an instance of IOLoop already exists before calling the `make_current` method. However, the bug in the current implementation is causing an incorrect behavior where it raises a RuntimeError even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not properly handling the case when an instance of IOLoop already exists, leading to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when an instance of IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we use the `not` keyword to check if an instance of IOLoop does not exist before calling `self.make_current()`. Similarly, we use the absence of `not` to check if an instance of IOLoop already exists before raising a RuntimeError.
