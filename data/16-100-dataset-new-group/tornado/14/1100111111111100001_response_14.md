The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the logic that checks for the existence of an IOLoop instance before creating a new one. The current logic is causing the RuntimeError to be raised even when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The buggy function's logic can be fixed by modifying the conditional statement to ensure that `make_current` is processed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists. This fix should address the failing test case provided.
