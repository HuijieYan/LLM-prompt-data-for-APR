## Explanation
The buggy function has a conditional statement that checks for the presence of the current IOLoop instance and makes it current if it's not already. However, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is flawed, leading to the incorrect behavior observed in the failing tests and reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug occurs because the conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`. The logic should ensure that if `make_current` is `True`, the IOLoop instance should already exist, and if not, it should raise a RuntimeError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional logic for handling the `make_current` parameter needs to be modified. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check for the existence of the IOLoop instance and raise a RuntimeError if it already exists. When `make_current` is `None` or `False`, it should then proceed to make the current instance.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional check for `make_current` is explicitly checking for `True` and handling the case where the current IOLoop instance already exists. This resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and fixes the bug.
