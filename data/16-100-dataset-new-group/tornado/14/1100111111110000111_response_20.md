The bug within the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` exists is incorrect. The bug causes the `initialize` function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` saying that the current `IOLoop` already exists, even when it doesn't.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly used to check if the current `IOLoop` exists or not. This condition should actually be checking if the current `IOLoop` is already initialized or not.

The strategy to fix this bug is to modify the condition inside the `initialize` function to correctly check if the `IOLoop` instance is already initialized or not, and then adjust the subsequent logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function now correctly checks if the `IOLoop` instance exists, and raises a `RuntimeError` only if the `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`. This should fix the bug and make it pass the failing test.
