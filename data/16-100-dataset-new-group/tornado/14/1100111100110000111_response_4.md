### Analysis:
The `initialize` function is checking if the current IOLoop instance exists and then either creating a new one or raising an error. The error message indicates that it is raising a `RuntimeError` even though the check for an existing IOLoop instance returned `None`, which is unexpected.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations are in the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance is not working as expected. It is returning `None`, but the code is treating it as if the instance already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance is correctly evaluating the existence of the instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: Changed the conditional check
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: Changed the conditional check
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the changes to the conditional checks in the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug is fixed. The corrected version ensures that the code only creates a new IOLoop instance if it does not exist, and raises an error if it already exists.
