Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is `True`, but the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is still `None`, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the conditional checks in the `initialize` function are not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is still `None`. This condition should not lead to a `RuntimeError` as it currently does.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the conditional checks in the `initialize` function need to be revised to accurately handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the conditional check for `make_current` being `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` being `None` has been adjusted to prevent the `RuntimeError` from being raised inappropriately.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in GitHub as well as pass the failing test described.
