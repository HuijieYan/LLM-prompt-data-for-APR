The buggy function `initialize` is meant to set the current `IOLoop` if the `make_current` argument is set to `True`. However, it is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the function is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if it is not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This causes the test to fail when it attempts to force the current `IOLoop` to be the current instance.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the check for the current `IOLoop` instance and simply set the current `IOLoop` to be the instance created by the `initialize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will set the current `IOLoop` to be the instance created by the `initialize` function, regardless of whether there is already a current instance. This should resolve the `RuntimeError` and allow the test to pass.
