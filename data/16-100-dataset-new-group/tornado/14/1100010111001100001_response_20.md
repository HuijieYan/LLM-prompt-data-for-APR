The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop. However, it fails to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly, leading to a RuntimeError in the provided test case.

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conditional checks for `make_current`. It does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for `make_current` need to be adjusted. If `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if the current IOLoop already exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
