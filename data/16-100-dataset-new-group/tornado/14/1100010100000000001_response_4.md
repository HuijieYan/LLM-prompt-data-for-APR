## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is checking if `make_current` is None, and if so, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None and makes it current. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None and raises a RuntimeError if it is not, otherwise it makes it current.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The logic in the if-else statements might be incorrect.
2. The `self.make_current()` method might not be working as intended.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug might be caused by the incorrect logic in the if-else statements, and the `self.make_current()` method might not be called when it should be.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Review the if-else logic to ensure it correctly handles the different scenarios.
2. Verify that the `self.make_current()` method behaves as intended when called.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
