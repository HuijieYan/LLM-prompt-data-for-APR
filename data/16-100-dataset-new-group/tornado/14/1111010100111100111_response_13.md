The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class seems to be raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is set to `True`. This is conflicting with the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` being `None`. 

It appears that the code is trying to handle if a current `IOLoop` does not exist, but the logic is incorrect, which is causing the `RuntimeError` to be erroneously raised.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` does not exist, and only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should properly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` does not exist and only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists. This should resolve the failing test and the issue posted on GitHub.
