The `initialize` function is supposed to set the current instance of the IOLoop when called with the `make_current` parameter. The bug here is that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current` already exists, but this check is not working as intended.

The `initialize` function should not raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current` already exists, but should set the current instance if `make_current` is True.

To fix this bug, we need to change the logic in the `initialize` function so that it sets the current instance if `make_current` is True, without the need to raise a `RuntimeError`. Additionally, if `make_current` is None, it should check if `IOLoop.current` is None before setting the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
