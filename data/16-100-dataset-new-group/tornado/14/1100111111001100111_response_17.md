The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. The problem is that the `initialize` function doesn't properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

In the failing test, the `test_force_current` function sets `make_current` to `True` when initializing the `IOLoop` instance. It then checks whether the current IOLoop instance has been correctly set and raises an error if a second `make_current=True` construction is attempted. However, the buggy `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when a current IOLoop already exists, and it does not properly raise an error in that situation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists. The function should raise an error in this case.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the `initialize` function correctly checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to `True` and raises an error if one already exists. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and make the failing test pass.
