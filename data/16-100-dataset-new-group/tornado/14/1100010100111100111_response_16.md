The buggy function `initialize` is checking if the current IOLoop exists, and if not, it is trying to make it the current IOLoop. However, the logic for checking if the current IOLoop exists is flawed, leading to the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

The bug is caused by the incorrect check for the current IOLoop instance. This check is flawed because it is raising a RuntimeError when the current IOLoop exists, instead of when it does not exist.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current IOLoop existence needs to be corrected. The correct approach is to raise a RuntimeError only if the current IOLoop instance does exist when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition `if make_current` is added to check if `make_current` is `True` before attempting to make it the current IOLoop.
- The condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop is changed to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, so that it raises a RuntimeError only if the current IOLoop exists and `make_current` is `True`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
