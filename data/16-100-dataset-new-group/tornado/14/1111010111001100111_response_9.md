The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class, and if the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, it should also attempt to become the current `IOLoop`. However, the issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The conditional statement for `make_current` is not properly handling the case when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter and the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance. When `make_current` is set to `True` and a current instance already exists, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements within the `initialize` function need to be updated to correctly handle the case when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make the new instance the current one.
2. If a current instance exists and `make_current` is set to `True`, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. If `make_current` is not provided, simply make the new instance the current one if no current instance exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should resolve the bug and make the failing test case `test_force_current` pass. The function now properly handles the `make_current` parameter and the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.
