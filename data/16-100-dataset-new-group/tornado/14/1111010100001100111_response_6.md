## Analysis
The `initialize` function is supposed to control the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter, but it has some issues, as reported in the GitHub issue. The problem seems to be related to the condition checks inside the function.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Conditional statements inside the `initialize` function.
2. Comparison of the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` with `None`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the conditional check for `make_current` and the comparison with the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` are not properly handling the scenario where the current `IOLoop` already exists. This leads to the inconsistent behavior reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `initialize` function correctly handles the scenario where the current `IOLoop` already exists. This can be achieved by refining the conditional statements and the comparison with the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we retrieve the current `IOLoop` instance before the conditional checks and use that value to make the comparisons. This ensures that the behavior is consistent and handles the scenario where the current `IOLoop` already exists.
