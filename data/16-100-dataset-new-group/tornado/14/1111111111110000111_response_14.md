# The potential error location: 
The potential error in the buggy function is in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:`. This condition is supposed to check whether an `IOLoop` instance already exists or not, but the logic seems to be incorrect based on the failing test and error message. 

# Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not correctly handling the case where an `IOLoop` instance already exists, leading to the incorrect RuntimeError exception being raised.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where an `IOLoop` instance already exists. Additionally, we should ensure that the `make_current` argument is correctly implemented based on the expected behavior.

# Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic is modified to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the condition for checking the existence of the `IOLoop` instance. Now, the `initialize` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
