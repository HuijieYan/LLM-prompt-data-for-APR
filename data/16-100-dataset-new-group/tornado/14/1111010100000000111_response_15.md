## Analysis
The buggy function is the `initialize` method inside the `IOLoop` class. This function is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance, and it takes a `make_current` argument. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that there is a problem with the logic inside the `initialize` method, specifically at line 252, where it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `if` condition at line 252: `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` 
2. The condition that follows at line 254 which raises `RuntimeError`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` method is incorrect. When `make_current` is None and the current instance of `IOLoop` is None, it should make the current `IOLoop`. However, when `make_current` is None and the current instance of `IOLoop` is not None, it should not do anything. This is likely not happening, leading to the reported issue.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic inside the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the current instance of `IOLoop`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version of the code, we have simplified the logic inside the `initialize` method. We check if `make_current` is True and if the current instance of `IOLoop` is not None, then we raise the `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we make the current `IOLoop`. This aligns with the expected behavior and should resolve the reported issue.
