The bug in the `initialize` method is causing the test to fail. The `initialize` method is checking if the current IOLoop instance exists, but it is not handling the case properly when `make_current` is `True`.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists. In this case, the method should raise a `RuntimeError` because it is attempting to create a new IOLoop instance when one already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected method, the test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError` when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance when one already exists.
