The issue is with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class. The problem arises due to inconsistency in the logic of handling the `make_current` argument. The GitHub issue suggests that the `current` function is returning `None` when it should not be, leading to the raise of "already exists" error.

The bug is likely located in the logic of the `initialize` function. The `make_current` argument is not being handled properly. When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None`, and if so, it calls `make_current()` to make the current `IOLoop`. When `make_current` is `True`, it does the same check for `None`, but if it's not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` function. We should handle the logic of checking for the current `IOLoop` separately for each case of `make_current` being `None` or `True`, and if necessary, update the current `IOLoop` accordingly.

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function now correctly handles both cases of `make_current` being `None` and `True`, without raising unnecessary errors. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and the failing test.
