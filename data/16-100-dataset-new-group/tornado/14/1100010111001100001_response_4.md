The buggy function has a problem with checking and handling the make_current parameter. The current implementation is not correctly processing the make_current parameter and is not raising the RuntimeError as expected in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case where make_current is True, and IOLoop.current() already exists. Instead, it is allowing the creation of a new IOLoop instance in violation of the failing test's expectation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the make_current parameter and properly check if an IOLoop instance already exists when make_current is True.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic in the elif statement, we are correctly checking for the existence of an IOLoop instance when make_current is True and properly raising a RuntimeError if it already exists.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
