The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it incorrectly checks for the current instance of the `IOLoop`, which leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised in the `test_force_current` test case.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function tries to make the current IOLoop instance without properly checking if one already exists, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised when trying to force the current IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should only try to make the current instance if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, and should raise an error if there is already a current instance of the IOLoop.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, the `test_force_current` test case should pass without raising a `RuntimeError` and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
