The buggy function is `initialize` which takes a parameter `make_current` of type `bool`. The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if the current IOLoop is `None` and then calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not `None` and is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop is `None` and then raises a `RuntimeError` if it is not.

The failing test is trying to create an IOLoop with `make_current` set to `True`, and it is failing with a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is checking if the current IOLoop exists when `make_current` is `True`, but it should actually be checking if the current IOLoop does not exist, and then making it the current IOLoop.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
