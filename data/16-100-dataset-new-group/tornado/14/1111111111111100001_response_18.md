The bug in the given code is causing the `initialize` function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument, even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

The issue lies in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, the code incorrectly checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if that is the case. This behavior is incorrect because the intent is to create a new `IOLoop` instance if one does not already exist.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True`. The check for an existing `IOLoop` instance should only result in an error when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is an existing `IOLoop` instance.

By making this change, the failing test case should now pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
