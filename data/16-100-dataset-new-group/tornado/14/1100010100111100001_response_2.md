The buggy function is failing because it is not correctly handling the case when make_current is True. It should check if an IOLoop instance already exists and raise an error if it does.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.initialized():
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This way, the function checks if an IOLoop instance has already been initialized using the `initialized` method and raises a RuntimeError if it has. Otherwise, it proceeds to make the IOLoop current.

With this fix, the function should pass the failing test case.
