Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The `if` statement that checks if `make_current` is None may be causing the issue.
- The `if` statement that checks if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` is not None may also be a potential error location.

Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The code in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance and make it the current `IOLoop`. However, the code fails to properly handle the cases where `make_current` is None or True, and the current `IOLoop` is already present. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to properly handle the cases where `make_current` is None or True, and the current `IOLoop` is already present. Additionally, the error messages and conditions should be appropriately set.

Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we first store the current `IOLoop` instance in the variable `current_instance`. Then we use this variable to check whether there already is a current `IOLoop` depending on the value of `make_current` and raise the RuntimeError if necessary.
