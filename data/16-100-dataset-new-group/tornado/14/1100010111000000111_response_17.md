## The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
1. The original function had an issue with the condition checks and behavior of `make_current`.
2. The original function did not correctly handle the situation where `make_current` is set to True and there is already a current instance of IOLoop.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` was not passing because the original function did not raise a RuntimeError when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when there is already a current instance.
4. The bug was causing the function to incorrectly handle the situation where a current IOLoop already exists. The corrected version fixes this by first checking the current instance and then handling the `make_current` logic accordingly.
5. The corrected version of the function above should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
