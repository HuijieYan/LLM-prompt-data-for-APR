### Analysis of the buggy function
The buggy function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and check if the current IOLoop already exists. However, there is a conditional check for `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, which seems to be causing the bug.

### Identified potential error
The potential error lies in the conditional checks for `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

### Explanation of the bug
When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the current conditional check is not handling this case correctly, which is causing the bug.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
We need to modify the conditional checks to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists. Additionally, the condition for `make_current is None` seems redundant as it is being handled in the subsequent conditional block. It can be removed to simplify the function.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
