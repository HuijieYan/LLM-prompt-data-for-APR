## Analysis:
The bug is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. This function is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance, but it has a logic flaw. When `make_current` is not provided and the current `IOLoop` instance is None, it should call `self.make_current()`. However, the logic does not seem to be implemented correctly.

## Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditional statements where it checks for the current `IOLoop` instance and decides whether to initialize a new one or raise an error.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic to check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is not implemented correctly. It is not properly handling the scenario when `make_current` is None and the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional statements that check for the current `IOLoop` instance. Also, the logic for when `make_current` is not provided needs to be properly handled.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, I have changed the logic to properly handle the case when `make_current` is None. I also simplified the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and raising an error if it already exists. Additionally, I removed the redundant `elif` condition and directly used `else` to check for the presence of `make_current`.
