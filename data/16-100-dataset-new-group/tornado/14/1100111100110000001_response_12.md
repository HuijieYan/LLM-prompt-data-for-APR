The buggy function `initialize` is expecting an argument `make_current`, which defaults to `None`. If `make_current` is not provided or is None, the function checks if the `IOLoop.current` instance is None and then calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is True, then it again checks if `IOLoop.current` instance is None, and raises a `RuntimeError` if it's not.

The error message indicates that when `make_current` is True, `IOLoop.current` instance is not None, which is causing the `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should be removed from the `elif` block, as it is not necessary in that case.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test.
