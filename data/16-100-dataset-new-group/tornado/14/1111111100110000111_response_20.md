The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `IOLoop.current` instance is `None` before calling the `make_current` method. However, if the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, it also checks if the `IOLoop.current` instance is `None` and raises a `RuntimeError` if it is not `None`. This is contradictory and leads to the reported issue.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the conflicting conditions in the `initialize` method. If `make_current` is `True`, it should simply call the `self.make_current()` without checking if the current instance is `None` since the purpose of setting `make_current` to `True` is to force the creation of a new current instance.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks in the `initialize` function should be re-evaluated and refactored to handle the `make_current` argument properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will first check if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and in both cases, it will call `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is explicitly set to `False`, it will then check if the current instance exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
