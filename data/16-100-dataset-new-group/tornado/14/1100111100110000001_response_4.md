The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not functioning correctly. It is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance, but it is failing to do so and raising a `RuntimeError` instead.

The key problem lies in the condition that checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is being raised when the `make_current` is `True`, suggesting that the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, the condition where the `make_current` parameter is `True` needs to be revisited. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the `make_current` method is called properly based on the parameter value.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the condition for `make_current` is inverted and a proper check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is performed based on the parameter value. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function functions as intended.
