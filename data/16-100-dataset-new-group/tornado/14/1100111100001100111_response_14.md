The bug in the initialize function is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should be checking if the current IOLoop instance is not None rather than comparing it to None.

The buggy function is checking whether the current IOLoop instance is None, and if it is, it's either making it the current instance or raising a RuntimeError. The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly checking for None but should be checking for not None.

To fix this bug, we should change the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This change in the if condition will resolve the issue and address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
