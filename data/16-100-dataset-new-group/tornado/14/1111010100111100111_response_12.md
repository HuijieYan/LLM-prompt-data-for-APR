The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the issue is that even if `make_current` is `True`, the function is still trying to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then raising a `RuntimeError` if it does.

The cause of the bug can be identified by looking at the implementation of the `initialize` function and the error message. The function first checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()` to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is not `None`, it then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does.

The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists", meaning that the code path for checking if the `IOLoop` already exists is being triggered even when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, we should remove the check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. Instead, we should directly call `self.make_current()` to set the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True`. If so, it directly calls `self.make_current()` to set the current `IOLoop` instance. This eliminates the unnecessary check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, and it should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
