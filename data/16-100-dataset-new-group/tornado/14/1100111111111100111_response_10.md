The buggy function is the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance and handle cases where a current IOLoop already exists. However, the failing test `test_force_current` indicates that the function is not working as expected. When `make_current` is set to True, it should raise a RuntimeError if a current IOLoop already exists, but it does not behave as expected.

The potential error location would be the conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional check for a current IOLoop instance is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is set to True. This results in the RuntimeError not being raised when it should be, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for checking the existence of a current IOLoop and the behavior when `make_current` is True is correctly implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated condition to check if current IOLoop exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the conditional check for the existence of a current IOLoop when `make_current` is True will work as intended, and the RuntimeError will be raised when necessary.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
