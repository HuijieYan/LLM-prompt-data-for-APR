In the buggy function `initialize` of the `IOLoop` class, the issue is that the `make_current` parameter is not being handled correctly. The logic to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` or not is not functioning as intended.

The cause of the bug is that in the `initialize` function, when `make_current` is not provided, it should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then make the current `IOLoop`. However, due to the incorrect logic, it is not working as expected. Additionally, the logic for `make_current` being `True` is also incorrect, as it should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` and then make the current `IOLoop`.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted. Here's a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current(instance=False)
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current(instance=False)
```

In this corrected version, when `make_current` is not provided, it correctly checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None` and then makes the current `IOLoop`. Similarly, when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` is not `None` and then makes the current `IOLoop`.

By implementing this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
