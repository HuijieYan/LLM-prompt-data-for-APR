The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the RuntimeError to be raised when it shouldn't be. The issue seems to be with the conditional checks for `make_current`.

The strategy to fix the bug is to update the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Update the conditional check
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Update the conditional check
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test.
