## The analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with buggy class, related functions, test code, corresponding error message, the GitHub issue.

The buggy function is the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. This method is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` object and making it the current `IOLoop` if no current `IOLoop` instance exists. It also has an argument `make_current` which is expected to control whether the new `IOLoop` should try to become current or not.

The test file `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` contains a test case `test_force_current` to check whether the `IOLoop` can be successfully initialized as the current `IOLoop` or if there are issues with multiple initializations. When running this test, it fails with the error message indicating that it is trying to raise `RuntimeError` for an existing current `IOLoop`, but the check for a current `IOLoop` returns `None`. 

The GitHub issue titled "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" is related to the same problematic line and questions the logic behind raising "already exists" when the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential errors could be related to the condition checks inside the `initialize` method for `make_current` being `None` or `True`.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the related functions, the failing test, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect logic in the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, it should not raise a `RuntimeError` based on the logic implemented. This issue is reported in the GitHub issue, indicating that the behavior is not as expected.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the conditional logic inside the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and no current `IOLoop` instance exists.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None and current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None:
        if make_current and current is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current and current is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
