### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` has a conditional block that checks whether `make_current` is None and then calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. However, the comparison with `None` is causing confusion due to the presence of the `current` method inside the `IOLoop` class as well as the standalone `current` function. This is causing a mix-up in the method resolution order, leading to the incorrect comparison and potentially raising a RuntimeError even when it's not necessary.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct `current` method is called based on the context of the class. This can be achieved by explicitly specifying the class name when calling the `current` method inside the `IOLoop` class.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # other methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # calling the current method of the class instance
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we replace `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` with `self.current(instance=False)` to ensure that the method call is resolved in the context of the class instance. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and resolve the bug.
