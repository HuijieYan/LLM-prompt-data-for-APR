Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `initialize` function, the logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not might be flawed.
2. The condition for raising a `RuntimeError` may not be correct.

Cause of the Bug:
The `initialize` function is responsible for initializing the current `IOLoop` instance and setting it as the current instance. If `make_current` is not specified, the function is supposed to check if an instance already exists and make the current instance if not. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it should raise an error if an instance already exists. The bug appears to be in the conditional logic that checks for the existence of the current instance.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Fix the conditional logic within the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current instance based on the value of `make_current`.
2. Update the logic to raise a `RuntimeError` only if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists.

Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, `current_instance` is used to store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to avoid multiple function calls. Then, the conditional blocks are updated to properly use `current_instance` to determine whether to make the current instance or raise a `RuntimeError`. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
