#### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current(True)
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the original buggy function, the logic for checking whether the IOLoop is current or not is incorrect. The function should check if the IOLoop is not current before making it current, and if it is current before raising an error.

The corrected version of the function includes these changes and successfully handles the make_current parameter, ensuring that an error is raised if the IOLoop is already current and making it current otherwise. This should fix the failing test case provided.
