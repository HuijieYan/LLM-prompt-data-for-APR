The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and an existing `IOLoop` instance already exists. The function should not raise an error when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance. If an instance already exists, the function should not raise an error.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code)

    # The corrected initialize function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                return  # Do nothing if current IOLoop already exists
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. If it does, the function does nothing. If an instance does not exist, then it makes the current instance.

When `make_current` is `None`, the function makes the current instance if there is no existing instance. This matches the behavior described in the class documentation.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
