Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it attempts to make the current `IOLoop`. However, there seems to be an issue with the logic as it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

The buggy function `initialize` has a logic issue in the `if` condition for `make_current` being `None`. It incorrectly checks if the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if so, it makes the current `IOLoop`. This logic is flawed because if `make_current` is `None`, it should not be checking for the presence of a current `IOLoop` at all.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be corrected. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            # If there is already a current IOLoop, then do nothing
            return
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, if `make_current` is `None`, it directly checks if there is already a current `IOLoop`, and if so, it does nothing. If there is no current `IOLoop`, it makes the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` and raises a `RuntimeError` appropriately if there is already a current `IOLoop`.

This correction should resolve the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub.
