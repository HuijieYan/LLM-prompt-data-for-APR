The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the failing test `test_force_current`. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`. The logic in the `initialize` function wrongly checks if there is already an existing current IOLoop regardless of the value of `make_current`. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised even though it is expected to create a new IOLoop if `make_current` is set to `True`.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be corrected to properly handle the different cases for `make_current`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly create a new IOLoop if `make_current` is set to `True` and will not raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop already exists.

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
