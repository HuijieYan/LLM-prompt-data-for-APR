The buggy function `initialize` has an issue where it checks if the `IOLoop.current` instance is None, but then raises a RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists". This is contradictory and causes confusion.

The cause of the bug is that the function checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if it is not, it raises an error. This logic is incorrect and results in the contradictory behavior reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function should only raise an error if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            return
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we added an `else` statement after the first `if` block to ensure that if the current IOLoop instance is not None, the function will return without raising an error. Additionally, we updated the condition in the second `if` block to check if the current instance is not None before raising the RuntimeError.
