The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to `True` and the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is actually `None`. This results in a `RuntimeError` being raised, even though it should not be because the `IOLoop.current` is `None`.

The problem lies in the conditional statement `if make_current:` in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and should only raise a `RuntimeError` if it is not `None`. However, the current implementation is doing the opposite, resulting in the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement `if make_current:` should be modified to correctly check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` before raising a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # fixed condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test in the GitHub issue.
