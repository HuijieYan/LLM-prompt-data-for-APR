The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is not handling the `make_current` argument properly, which causes the RuntimeError when trying to force the current IOLoop. The logic for handling the `make_current` argument is flawed.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to properly handle the `make_current` argument. The function should check if an IOLoop already exists and only set it as the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist. If it already exists, it should raise a RuntimeError.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the test case provided should now pass without raising a RuntimeError and the logic for handling the `make_current` argument is now functioning as intended.
