## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The conditional check for `make_current is None` and `make_current` might not be working as intended.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter needs to be reviewed.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The failing test `test_force_current` indicates that when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. This behavior does not match the expected behavior as per the test.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The strategy for fixing the bug would involve re-evaluating the conditional checks and the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. It also requires ensuring that the `make_current` parameter is properly handled to align with the expected behavior as indicated by the failing test.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None: 
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes, the `initialize` function should handle the `make_current` parameter correctly, and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
