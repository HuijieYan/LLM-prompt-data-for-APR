The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop. The function should check if there is already an existing instance of the IOLoop and, if not, it should make the current IOLoop.

The error message indicates that the bug is causing the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when it should not be doing so.

The cause of the bug is that within the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, there is a line:
```
if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
    self.make_current()
```
This logic is intended to check if there is already a current IOLoop (when `make_current` is not specified), and if not, make the current IOLoop.

However, the problem is that the logic checks for `None` to determine if there is already a current IOLoop, but this is incorrect. Instead of checking for `None`, it should check for the presence of a current IOLoop.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly identify if a current IOLoop exists or not. 
Here's a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
By using the `current_instance` variable to store the current IOLoop, we can check for its presence correctly and fix the bug.
