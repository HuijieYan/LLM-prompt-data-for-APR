### Analysis
The function checks if `make_current` is `None` and if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If both conditions are met, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and raises an error if it already exists.

### Error location
The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is the potential error location as it checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs when the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is always evaluated as `True`, leading to calling `self.make_current()` even when it should not.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the condition checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
