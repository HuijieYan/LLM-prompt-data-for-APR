The buggy function is `initialize` and it is part of the `IOLoop` class. The function takes an optional parameter `make_current`, which is used to determine whether the current `IOLoop` instance should be set as the current instance.

The error message indicates that the test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but it fails because a current `IOLoop` already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to set it as the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first retrieve the current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and then we use that instance to check whether a current instance exists before attempting to set it as the current instance.
