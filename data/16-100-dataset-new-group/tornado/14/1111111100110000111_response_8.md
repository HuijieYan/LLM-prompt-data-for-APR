The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is meant to initialize the IOLoop instance. The `initialize` function takes `make_current` as an argument, which controls whether the current IOLoop is already set or not. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current IOLoop is not set, and if so, sets the current IOLoop by calling `make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current IOLoop is already set, and if not, raise a `RuntimeError`.

The error message suggests that the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop is not working correctly, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when the current IOLoop is not set.

The GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" indicates that at line 252 in `ioloop.py`, the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`, but a "current IOLoop already exists" `RuntimeError` is being raised.

The cause of the bug is likely an incorrect condition checking for the existence of the current IOLoop within the `initialize` function.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop based on the `make_current` argument needs to be adjusted. Specifically, the check for `make_current=None` needs to be altered to ensure that it correctly sets the current IOLoop using the `make_current` method. Additionally, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists needs to be revised to handle the case where `make_current=True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With these corrections, the `initialize` function should behave as intended and pass the failing test, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
