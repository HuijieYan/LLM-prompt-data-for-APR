## Analysis:
The buggy function "initialize" is checking if the current instance of IOLoop is None before calling the "make_current" method. However, there seems to be a confusion in the logic causing the RuntimeError to be raised when the current IOLoop is actually None.

## Potential error locations:
1. Line 9: Calling the current method from the IOLoop class using instance=False may be causing the issue in logic.
2. Line 13: The logic to raise RuntimeError based on the result of current() method call may be incorrect.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be caused by a misunderstanding of the logic of the current() method and its relationship with the make_current() method. The code is checking if the current IOLoop instance is None and raising a RuntimeError based on that, but the logic is not handling the case correctly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic to properly handle the case when IOLoop.current() is None.
2. Ensure that the make_current() method is called when necessary, without raising a RuntimeError when the current IOLoop is None.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic inside the initialize method checks if the current IOLoop exists by calling IOLoop.current() without specifying the instance argument. It then calls the make_current() method based on the condition. Additionally, the logic for raising a RuntimeError has been modified to check if the current IOLoop is not None before raising the error.

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
