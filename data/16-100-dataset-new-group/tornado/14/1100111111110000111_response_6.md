### Revised Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                IOLoop.make_current(self) # Fix: Call the method using the class name
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None: # Fix: Check if current IOLoop exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                IOLoop.make_current(self) # Fix: Call the method using the class name
    
```

By making these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
