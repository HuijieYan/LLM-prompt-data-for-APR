The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is expected to initialize the IOLoop, but it is failing when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. The failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file is trying to create two IOLoop instances with `make_current=True` and expecting the second instance to raise a `RuntimeError` since the current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the condition `elif make_current` where it checks if the current IOLoop exists and immediately raises a `RuntimeError`. This prevents the possibility of creating a new IOLoop when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function doesn't properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. When `make_current` is True and the IOLoop already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, it should only call `self.make_current()` if the current IOLoop does not exist.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to only call `self.make_current()` if the current IOLoop does not exist. If `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop exists, then it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will only call `self.make_current()` if the current IOLoop does not exist, and it will raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists. This should fix the bug and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
