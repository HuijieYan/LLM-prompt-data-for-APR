The buggy function `initialize` is failing because it is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is checking if `make_current` is `True` and if an IOLoop already exists, in which case it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, when `make_current` is `True`, it should always make the IOLoop current, regardless of whether an IOLoop already exists or not.

To fix this bug, the function should not check if an IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is `True`. Instead, it should always make the IOLoop current if `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test.
