## Analyzing the buggy function
The function seems to be an initialization function for an IOLoop object. It checks if the IOLoop is already the current instance and then sets it as the current instance if required.

## Identified potential error locations
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used twice, which could cause redundancy or potential issues.
2. In the `elif` block, the condition `elif make_current` is not well defined and might not work as intended.

## Cause of the bug
The bug in the function may arise due to the redundant check for the current instance of IOLoop and the unclear condition in the `elif` block.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Remove the redundant check for the current instance.
2. Rewrite the conditions in a clearer and more specific way to avoid ambiguity.

## Corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```
