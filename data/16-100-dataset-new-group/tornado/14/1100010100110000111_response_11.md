## The bug analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is causing the test to fail with the error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`. The GitHub issue indicates that the problem is with `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` returning `None`, and then raising "already exists".

## Potential error location
The issue seems to be in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` not working as expected.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not correctly checking if the current IOLoop instance exists or not. This is leading to the incorrect error message being raised.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition correctly checks if the current IOLoop instance exists or not. This will involve debugging and possibly modifying the condition to accurately determine the presence of an existing IOLoop instance.

## The corrected version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
