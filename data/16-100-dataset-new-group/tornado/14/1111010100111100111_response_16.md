The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current instance if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly checking whether there is no current `IOLoop` instance, and then attempting to set the new instance as the current one. When `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if there is already an instance when `make_current` is `True` and simply return without raising an error.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):  # Check for current instance without comparison to None
            return
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, and if there is, it simply returns without raising an error.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
