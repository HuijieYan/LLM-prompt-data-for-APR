The buggy function `initialize` is trying to check if the `make_current` parameter is None, and if so, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if `IOLoop.current` is None, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements and the method calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and `self.make_current()`.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking if the current IOLoop exists seems to be incorrect. If `make_current` is not None, it should check if the current IOLoop exists, and if not, it should call `make_current`. However, the logic is currently calling `make_current` first and then checking if the current IOLoop exists.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic of the conditional statements to properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop and call `make_current` if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # removed the unnecessary check for None since it's already handled above
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
                # raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop already exists
            self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the logic has been updated to first check if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `make_current`. If `make_current` is not None, it directly checks if the current IOLoop exists, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError. Then, it calls `make_current` after that.
