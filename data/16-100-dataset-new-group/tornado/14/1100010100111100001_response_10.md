The buggy function is failing when the input parameter `make_current` is set to `True`. The error message indicates that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". 

The buggy function checks if `make_current` is `True` and then checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`. The bug seems to be that the function is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic in the function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists. We can simply remove the check for the IOLoop instance and always make the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # removed the check for make_current being True
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will always make the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`, regardless of whether an IOLoop instance already exists. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
