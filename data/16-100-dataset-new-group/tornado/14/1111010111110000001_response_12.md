After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class and the failing test, here's the identification of potential error locations:

The error likely occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` method checks the `make_current` parameter and the current instance of the `IOLoop`, and based on that, it determines whether to set the current `IOLoop` or raise a `RuntimeError` if it already exists.

The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. It then checks whether the newly created `IOLoop` instance is set as the current instance and if a second creation with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.

The error message indicates that the `initialize` method is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when it should not be doing so based on the failing test case.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when trying to make a new `IOLoop` instance the current instance, even if it's allowed according to the failing test case. The `make_current` parameter check and the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` are not functioning as expected.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`. The method should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` method, it should now correctly handle setting the current `IOLoop` and provide the expected behavior according to the failing test case.
