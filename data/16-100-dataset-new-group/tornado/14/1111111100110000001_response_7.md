The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is not properly handling the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the `initialize` method incorrectly attempts to raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, even though this is not the desired behavior.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic within the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is `True`, it should simply call the `make_current` method without checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will properly set the current `IOLoop` instance without raising an error.
