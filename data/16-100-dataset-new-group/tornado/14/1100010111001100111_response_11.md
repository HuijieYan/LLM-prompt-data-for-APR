### Bug Explanation
The issue arises from the `initialize` function in the `ioloop.py` file. The bug occurs when trying to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. It mistakenly raises a `RuntimeError` even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the conditional statement inside the `initialize` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The `initialize` function has a conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is `True` and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and then raises a `RuntimeError` if the condition is met. The bug occurs because even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it still raises the `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version of the function, the failing test should pass and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
