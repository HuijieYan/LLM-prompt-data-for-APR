The bug in the provided function causes a RuntimeError to be raised when the make_current flag is set to True and an IOLoop instance already exists. The bug is in the logic of the if-else conditions where it should be checking if make_current is True and not None.

To fix the bug, the conditions in the function should be modified to correctly check if make_current is True, and if so, whether an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Corrected condition to check if make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if an IOLoop instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
