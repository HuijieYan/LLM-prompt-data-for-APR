The bug in the `initialize` function is that it always raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`, regardless of the existing state of the IOLoop.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is always evaluating to `False` because the `current` function returns a value that is not being checked correctly. This causes the `RuntimeError` to always be raised when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the IOLoop is already initialized before calling `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function checks if the IOLoop is already initialized before adopting the `make_current` behavior.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
