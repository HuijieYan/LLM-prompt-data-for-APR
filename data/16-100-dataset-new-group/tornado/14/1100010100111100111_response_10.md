### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` checks for the current existence of an IOLoop and then tries to make it current if it doesn't exist. However, in the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists, which is contradictory.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the check for the existence of the current IOLoop and the action taken based on `make_current` are consistent. This might involve modifying the conditional logic within the `initialize` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and store it in the `current_instance` variable. Then, we adjust the conditional logic based on `make_current` and `current_instance` to ensure that the function behaves as expected.
