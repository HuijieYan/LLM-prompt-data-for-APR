The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object, including checking whether there is an existing current IOLoop or not. The problem arises from how the function handles the `make_current` parameter, which is used to force a new IOLoop to become the current IOLoop.

The issue with the `initialize` function is that, when `make_current` is set to `True`, it is raising a RuntimeError without checking if the current IOLoop is already the same instance as the one being initialized. This results in the RuntimeError being raised even when the existing IOLoop is the same as the one being initialized.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` function should compare the current IOLoop instance with the one being initialized before deciding whether to raise a RuntimeError or not. Additionally, if `make_current` is not set, the function should still set the created IOLoop as the current one when a current IOLoop does not exist.

Here is a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if existing_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if existing_instance is not None and existing_instance is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
- The `existing_instance` variable is used to store the current IOLoop instance.
- When `make_current` is not set, the function checks if there is an existing instance and sets the created IOLoop as the current one when there is none.
- When `make_current` is set, the function checks if the existing instance is not `None` and it is not the same as the one being initialized. If so, it raises a RuntimeError, otherwise, it sets the created IOLoop as the current one.

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now be able to handle the IOLoop initialization correctly.
