```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change "is None" to "is not None"
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
By changing the condition from `is None` to `is not None`, the corrected version of the buggy function now correctly checks whether a current IOLoop already exists and raises the `RuntimeError` accordingly. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
