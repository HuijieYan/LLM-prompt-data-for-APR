The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not properly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is meant to initialize the IOLoop and set it as the current IOLoop if `make_current` is True. However, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect.

The function checks if `make_current` is None and then tries to make the IOLoop current if it is not already. However, if `make_current` is True, it should directly try to make the IOLoop current without checking for `None`.

Additionally, the logic for raising a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists is incorrect. If `make_current` is True, then it should raise the error only if the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter according to the requirements specified in the class docs.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check the current instance of the IOLoop and then handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly. This ensures that the IOLoop is properly initialized and set as the current IOLoop based on the value of `make_current`.
