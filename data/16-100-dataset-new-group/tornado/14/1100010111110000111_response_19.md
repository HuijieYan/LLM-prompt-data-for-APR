### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is failing the test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`. The failing test is expecting a RuntimeError to be raised when `make_current=True`, but the function is not raising the RuntimeError as expected. The error message from the failing test indicates that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not behaving as expected, leading to the incorrect behavior.

The GitHub issue suggests that there is a problem with the behavior of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` on line 252.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` within the `initialize` function. This condition is not working as intended and is causing the function to skip the check for an existing IOLoop instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition is not correctly checking if an IOLoop instance already exists. As a result, the function is not throwing the expected RuntimeError when `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` needs to be modified to correctly check if an IOLoop instance exists. Additionally, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter needs to be revisited to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the conditions for checking the existence of the IOLoop instance are modified to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly. This ensures that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.
