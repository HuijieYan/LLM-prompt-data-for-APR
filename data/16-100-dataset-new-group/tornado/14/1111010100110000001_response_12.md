The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" even when the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is `False`. This is causing the failing test to raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

The potential error location is within the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not checked properly, which leads to a `RuntimeError` even when the current `IOLoop` instance exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check whether an instance of `IOLoop` exists before raising a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance before proceeding to avoid raising the `RuntimeError`. This should ensure that the failing test passes without any `RuntimeError` being raised.
