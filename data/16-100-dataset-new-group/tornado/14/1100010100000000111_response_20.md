Based on the buggy function and the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem occurs when checking if the current IOLoop instance exists. The bug may be caused by the logic in the function not properly handling the case where the current IOLoop instance is None.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the initialize function to correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance, and then make it the current instance if it doesn't already exist.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first retrieve the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and then we use this instance to properly check for its existence and handle the logic accordingly. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
