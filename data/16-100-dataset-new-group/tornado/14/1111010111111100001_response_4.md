The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle creating a new `IOLoop` instance and making it the current one, if necessary. However, the current implementation is causing a `RuntimeError` when attempting to make the new `IOLoop` instance the current one.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the problem occurs when the `IOLoop` is constructed with `make_current=True`. The failing test expects the `IOLoop` instance to become the current one, but it fails due to a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The function should only attempt to make the new instance the current one if there is no current instance, and in this case, raise an error if there already is a current instance.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` function needs to check whether there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new instance the current one. If `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError` as it currently does in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This should resolve the `RuntimeError` that was encountered in the failing test.
