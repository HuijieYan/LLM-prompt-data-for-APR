The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not properly checking for the current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make a new one current. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised when a new `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` is initialized, even when there is already a current instance.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`. We can modify the function to only attempt to make the new `IOLoop` instance current if there is no current instance already present.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function now checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new one current when `make_current=True`.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
