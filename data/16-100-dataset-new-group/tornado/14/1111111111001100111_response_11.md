The cause of the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and making it the current instance is flawed. The issue on GitHub indicates that there is a discrepancy in the behavior of the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` call and the subsequent check for `None`, which is leading to the incorrect raised error of "current IOLoop already exists".

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be updated. Rather than checking for `None` directly, it should check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and handle the `make_current` argument accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This updated logic first retrieves the current instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and then checks if it exists or not, handling the `make_current` argument accordingly. This should resolve the faulty behavior and make the function pass the failing test.
