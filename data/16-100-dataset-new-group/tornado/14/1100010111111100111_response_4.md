The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is failing the test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`, resulting in a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". The failing test attempts to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then tries to create another `IOLoop` instance with the same `make_current=True`, which is expected to raise a `RuntimeError`.

The bug occurs because when `make_current=True` is passed as an input parameter to the `initialize` function, the function incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then raises a `RuntimeError` if it is not `None`.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly check if the current `IOLoop` instance is already set as the current instance before attempting to make it the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the function first retrieves the current `IOLoop` instance and then checks whether to make it the current instance based on the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.

This fix addresses the incorrect check that was causing the bug and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
