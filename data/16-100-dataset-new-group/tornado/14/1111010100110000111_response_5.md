The buggy function `initialize` from the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file seems to be causing an issue when attempting to check whether a current IOLoop exists.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Line 253: The conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` may not be working as intended.
2. Line 255: The conditional check `elif make_current:` may need to be reviewed for its logic.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks in the `initialize` function are not accurately determining the presence of a current IOLoop instance. This leads to an incorrect error being raised when attempting to initialize the IOLoop.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to accurately determine whether a current IOLoop instance exists and handle it accordingly. Perhaps the conditional checks can be revised to explicitly check if a current IOLoop instance already exists or not before attempting to make the IOLoop current.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

This revised version should accurately check if a current IOLoop instance exists or not and handle it accordingly, thus resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
