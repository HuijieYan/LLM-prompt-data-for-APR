The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue with checking if a current IOLoop instance exists and then attempting to make that instance the current IOLoop. 

The failing test `test_force_current` attempts to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True`, then tries to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` again. The expectation is that the second creation should fail and raise a `RuntimeError` because the current IOLoop has already been set.

The error message states that a `RuntimeError` is raised because the current IOLoop already exists. This indicates that the logic of the `initialize` function is not correctly detecting existing IOLoop instances.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` function should simply check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if so, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. If there is no current instance and `make_current=True`, the method should then make the instance the current `IOLoop`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code here)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

This should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
