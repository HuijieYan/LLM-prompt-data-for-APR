The buggy function `initialize` is intended to control the behavior of the `IOLoop` constructor by setting the current `IOLoop` instance. However, the bug occurs due to incorrect logic in handling the `make_current` parameter, leading to the wrong behavior when checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

The potential error location is within the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and the value of the `make_current` parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are not properly handled. When `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` instead of making the current instance as intended.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the logic within the function to correctly handle the cases when `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or `False`, and accurately determine the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        # Handle other cases or utilize a default behavior
        pass
```

In this corrected version, the current `IOLoop` instance is retrieved before the conditional statements, and the logic within the conditional blocks is adjusted to accurately handle the cases when `make_current` is `None` or `True`. Additionally, an `else` block or default behavior can be added for further handling of the `make_current` parameter.
