## Fixing the bug

The bug appears to be in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The issue is related to the logic of checking for the current instance of the `IOLoop` and whether to make it the current instance based on the `make_current` argument.

It seems that the bug causes the check for the current instance to fail and results in an incorrect RuntimeError being raised, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current instance and making it the current instance based on the `make_current` argument needs to be revised.

### A corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we first store the current instance of the `IOLoop` in a variable. Then, we modify the conditional statements to check `make_current` and the status of the current instance and adjust the behavior accordingly. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as expected.

By making these changes, the function should now properly handle the case when the current instance of `IOLoop` exists and when it doesn't, based on the `make_current` argument.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
