To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we can modify the logic to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for an existing current `IOLoop`. The issue is related to incorrect logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Analysis
1. The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class takes a `make_current` parameter, which controls whether the new `IOLoop` instance should become the current instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, even though the check for an existing current `IOLoop` returns `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. Specifically, we need to ensure that the check accurately determines whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists and handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... other functions and class documentation ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current:
                if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the `initialize` function, the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance has been modified. We now perform a check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` and raise a `RuntimeError` only if `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

This corrected version addresses the issue by ensuring that the `make_current` parameter is handled correctly and that the check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` provides the expected behavior.
