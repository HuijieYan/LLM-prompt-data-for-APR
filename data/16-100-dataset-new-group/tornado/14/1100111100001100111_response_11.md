The bug in the `initialize` function is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is always evaluated to `True`, regardless of the value of `make_current`. This is because the `current` function is called from the class `IOLoop` instead of as a standalone function. Also, the `make_current` function is not correctly utilized within the `initialize` function.

To fix the bug, I would suggest the following strategy:
1. Use the `make_current` parameter directly to determine whether to call the `make_current` function or raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. Remove the unnecessary calls to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` as they are not providing any useful information for the logic flow.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `make_current` parameter is used to determine whether to call the `make_current` function or raise a `RuntimeError`. The unnecessary calls to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` have been removed.
