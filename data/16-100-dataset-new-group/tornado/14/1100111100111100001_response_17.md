### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is no current IOLoop instance and then makes the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is no current IOLoop instance and then raises a `RuntimeError`.

The failing test is trying to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True`, but it fails with a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".

The issue seems to be with the logic to check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the if-else statements inside the `initialize` function. The current IOLoop instance is not being properly checked, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy
The fix should involve properly checking the current IOLoop instance before making a new instance or raising an error.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic is changed to correctly check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter. The correct `instance` parameter is used for the `IOLoop.current` function call.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
