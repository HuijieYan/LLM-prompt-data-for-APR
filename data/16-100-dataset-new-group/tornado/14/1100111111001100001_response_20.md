The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop, and it has a conditional statement that checks the `make_current` parameter. However, the issue arises from how the `make_current` parameter is being handled. 

The problem is with the line:
```python
if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
```
The `current` function is being called from the class, not from an instance, and it is intended to return the current IOLoop instance. However, this line is attempting to create a new instance by calling `make_current()` when `IOLoop.current()` returns None. This is not the intended behavior, and it causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that when `make_current=True`, it should create a new IOLoop instance and make it the current instance, and when `make_current=False`, it should only make the existing IOLoop instance the current one without creating a new instance.

Additionally, the way the `IOLoop.current` and `IOLoop.make_current` methods are being called should be reviewed to ensure they are being used appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `initialize` function checks for the current IOLoop instance appropriately and makes it the current instance or creates a new one based on the `make_current` parameter. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
