## Analysis
The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class. The function checks the `make_current` parameter and calls the `current` and `make_current` methods based on its value. 

The related functions `current` and `make_current` are also defined in the same file but in different classes within the `tornado.ioloop` module.

The GitHub issue indicates that there is confusion about the behavior of `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` in relation to the `make_current` parameter.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might not be evaluating as expected.
2. The usage of the `make_current` parameter and its interaction with `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` might be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect usage and evaluation of the `make_current` parameter and the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method. The condition `if make_current` might not be correctly interacting with the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is correctly evaluating the current IOLoop instance.
2. Review the usage of the `make_current` parameter and its interaction with `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to ensure the logic is correct.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # Removed the `elif` condition for `make_current`
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Changed the condition to check if IOLoop instance exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. Removed the `elif` condition for `make_current` to avoid unnecessary checks.
2. Updated the condition in the `else` block to check if `IOLoop.current` is not None when `make_current` is specified.
3. The corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post by addressing the potential logic errors.
