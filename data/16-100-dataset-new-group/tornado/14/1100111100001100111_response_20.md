The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The problem arises from the logic for checking and setting the `make_current` parameter. In some cases, the logic does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter leading to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `None`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then calls `self.make_current()` to create a new instance. However, when `make_current` is `True`, the function again checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if not, raises a `RuntimeError`. This logic is flawed because it should not check for `None` when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the existing `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable for reusability. Then we update the logic to check whether the `make_current` parameter is `None` or `True` and appropriately handle the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance or raising a `RuntimeError` based on the existence of the current instance.
