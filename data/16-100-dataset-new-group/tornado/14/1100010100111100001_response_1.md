The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is True, the function is still checking if the current IOLoop instance exists and then raising an error if it does. This is contradictory to the intended behavior of making the current IOLoop instance.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the check for the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, when `make_current` is True, the function will simply call `self.make_current()` without checking if the current IOLoop instance exists, thus fixing the bug.
