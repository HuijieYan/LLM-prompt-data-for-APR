The cause of the bug is that the `make_current` parameter is not being properly checked in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly when `make_current` is True.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to properly handle the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function to ensure that the behavior is as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `make_current` parameter is properly handled. Now, when `make_current` is True, it checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
