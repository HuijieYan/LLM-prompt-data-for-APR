### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize an IOLoop object, but the logic for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists is flawed. The bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True`, even if an IOLoop instance does not exist.

The issue seems to stem from incorrect logic during the check for the existence of an IOLoop instance.

### Error Location
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` when `make_current` is `True`.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

### Bug Explanation
The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks in the `initialize` function are incorrect. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If the result is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`, even though this condition should not lead to raising an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional checks in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, we need to ensure that the IOLoop instance does not already exist before attempting to make it the current instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current:
                if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we fixed the conditional check for `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True`, we check if the IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance. If it does exist, we raise a `RuntimeError` as intended. Otherwise, we proceed with making it the current instance.
