The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current IOLoop instance. It takes an argument `make_current` that determines whether the calling instance should be made the current instance. However, the conditions and logic inside the function are not correctly handling the `make_current` argument and causing the test `test_force_current` to fail.

The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to True and another instance of `IOLoop` is already the current instance. In this case, the buggy function should raise a `RuntimeError` as indicated in the test, but it fails to do so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and raise an error if necessary.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
    elif IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

With the above correction, the `initialize` function now correctly handles the `make_current` argument and ensures that it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`. This should resolve the failing test case.
