The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance and make it the current instance. However, it has a bug that causes it to incorrectly handle the `make_current` parameter.

The first potential error location is in the conditional block checking if `make_current` is None. If that is the case, it should check if the IOLoop instance is already the current instance and if not, make it the current instance.

The second potential error location is in the conditional block checking if `make_current` is True. If that is the case, it should check if the current instance already exists and if not, raise a RuntimeError. Then, it should make the instance the current one.

The bug appears to be caused by the conditional statements not correctly checking the current instance and not handling the `make_current` parameter properly.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional statements to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and check the current instance's existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional to check if `make_current` is True, we correctly handle the case where the current instance already exists and properly raise a RuntimeError in that case. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
