### Bug Explanation
The buggy function has a conditional logic that checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if the current IOLoop is not already instantiated, then it calls `self.make_current()`. However, the logic for the `make_current` parameter is incorrect, as it does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance is already instantiated. This leads to a RuntimeError being raised in this scenario.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to update the conditional logic of the buggy function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists without raising a RuntimeError. Also, we need to ensure that the logic for `make_current` being `None` and the current IOLoop not being instantiated stays intact.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            # Handle the case where make_current is True and current IOLoop already exists
            # Updated logic to avoid raising RuntimeError
            pass
        self.make_current()
```
