The bug in the initialize function is causing the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" to be raised, even when make_current is set to True.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement `if make_current is None:` is not handling the case when make_current is True. This results in the RuntimeError being raised even when make_current is set to True.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should check if make_current is None or if make_current is True, and then only proceed to make the current IOLoop if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will only attempt to make the current IOLoop if either make_current is None or if make_current is True, and it should pass the failing test.
