The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, but it is not working as expected, as indicated by the failing test and the error message.

The buggy function appears to have an issue with the conditional logic in the `initialize` method. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` because it thinks that the current IOLoop already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic is incorrect, leading to the wrong behavior when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # removed redundant elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we removed the unnecessary `elif` condition and modified the `if` condition to handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. Now, the function should handle the initialization properly based on the value of `make_current`, and the failing test should pass.
