The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class when the `make_current` argument is `True`. The bug is causing a RuntimeError to be raised when attempting to make the current IOLoop even though one already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method is incorrectly checking if the IOLoop is already current before trying to make it current. If the `make_current` argument is `True`, it should always attempt to make the IOLoop current, regardless of whether it is already current or not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` method to always attempt to make the IOLoop current when `make_current` is `True`. We can remove the check for the current IOLoop instance and always call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` method will always attempt to make the IOLoop current when `make_current` is `True`, and no longer check for the current IOLoop instance before doing so. This should resolve the RuntimeError that was occurring in the failing test.
