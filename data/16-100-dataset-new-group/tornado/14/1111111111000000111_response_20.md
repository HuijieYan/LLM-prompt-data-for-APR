# The buggy function is `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class.
# The related functions are `current` and `make_current`.
# The failing test is `test_force_current` in `ioloop_test.py`.
# The GitHub issue is related to the value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` being `None` and yet the code raises "already exists".

# Potential errors:
# 1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might not be working as expected.
# 2. The logic to handle `make_current` might be problematic.

# Cause of the bug:
# The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop`, and if `make_current` is True, it should make the `IOLoop` instance the current instance. However, the logic to determine whether a current `IOLoop` instance already exists seems to be flawed. This is causing the issue where it tries to raise an error for an instance that is `None`.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
# The condition for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and handling the `make_current` argument needs to be reviewed and possibly re-implemented.

# Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking the current instance before deciding whether to make the current or raise an error, this corrected version should address the issue and the failing test.
