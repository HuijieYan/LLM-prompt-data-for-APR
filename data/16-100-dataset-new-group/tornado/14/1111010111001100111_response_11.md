The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `make_current` parameter and the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The conditional check for `make_current` being `None` or `True`.
2. The check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance and the subsequent handling of the `make_current` parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks and logic in the buggy function are not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance incorrectly.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the conditional checks properly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and check for the existence of an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly handles the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and checks for the existence of an existing current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new `IOLoop` instance current. This correction should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_force_current` passes.
