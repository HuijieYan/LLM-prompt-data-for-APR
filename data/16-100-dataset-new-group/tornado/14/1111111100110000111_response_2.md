### Explanation of the Bug

The bug is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` function takes a `make_current` argument, and based on its value, it either sets the current `IOLoop` or raises an error if one already exists.

However, the bug occurs when `make_current` is `None`. In this case, it checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None` and then calls the `make_current` method, without actually setting the current `IOLoop`. This leads to the error being raised erroneously when `make_current` is `None`, even if no current `IOLoop` exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is `None`, the `initialize` function correctly sets the current `IOLoop` if none exists, rather than raising an error.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `None`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None` and then sets it using the `make_current` method. When `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` is not `None` and then raises an error if one already exists.
