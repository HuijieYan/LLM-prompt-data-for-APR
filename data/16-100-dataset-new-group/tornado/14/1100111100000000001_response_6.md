## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is checking if the `make_current` parameter is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, the implementation of the `current` and `make_current` functions in the same class and the related functions in the same file is not clear from the provided code. There seems to be a mix of class and non-class methods, which might be causing the buggy behavior.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Mixing up class methods and non-class methods
2. Incorrect usage of the `current` and `make_current` functions

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug could be the mix-up between class methods and non-class methods, and the incorrect usage of `current` and `make_current` functions.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correct the usage of the `current` and `make_current` functions in the class `IOLoop`.
2. Ensure that the class methods are called properly within the class.
3. Use the `self` parameter to call the `make_current` function within the class.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def current(self, instance=True):  # Corrected the declaration of the current function
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # Corrected the call to the current method within the class
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # Corrected the call to the current method within the class
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
