The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that the logic to check for the current instance of `IOLoop` and whether to make the current instance is incorrect. The function is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument, leading to the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is flawed. When `make_current` is `None`, it is supposed to check if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` and then call `self.make_current()` to make the current instance. However, the current logic does not handle this scenario correctly. Similarly, when `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current instance already exists and then raise an error if so, or call `self.make_current()` if not. The current logic is not handling this scenario correctly either.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` argument.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass and the GitHub issue should be resolved. The logic now correctly checks for the current instance and handles the `make_current` argument as intended.
