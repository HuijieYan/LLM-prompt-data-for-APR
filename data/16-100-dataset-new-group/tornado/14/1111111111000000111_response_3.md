After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the related class, functions, and failing test, as well as the GitHub issue, it seems that the cause of the bug is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which is contradictory as per the GitHub issue.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the logic within the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and avoid raising the `RuntimeError` in that scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions and class details)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` method will first check if `make_current` is `None` and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, then it will make the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `True`, it will check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` already exists and raise `RuntimeError` only in that case.

This corrected version of the `initialize` method should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
