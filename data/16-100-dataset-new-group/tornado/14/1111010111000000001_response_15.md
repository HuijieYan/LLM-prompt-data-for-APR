The cause of the bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the `make_current` argument when initializing the `IOLoop` class. The `make_current` argument is intended to control whether the new `IOLoop` will become the current `IOLoop` instance or not. However, the current implementation does not handle this as intended, leading to the failing test `test_force_current` where a second `make_current=True` construction is not properly handled.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that it correctly makes the new `IOLoop` instance the current one if specified, or raises an error if there is already a current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        make_current = True
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function correctly handles the `make_current` argument and ensures that it makes the new `IOLoop` instance the current one if specified. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
