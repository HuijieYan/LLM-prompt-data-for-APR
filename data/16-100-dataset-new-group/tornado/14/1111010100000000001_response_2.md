The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class. It is used to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if specified.

Potential errors in the function:
1. `self.make_current()` is used without being defined within the `initialize` function.
2. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` may not work as intended and could lead to unexpected behavior.

Cause of the bug:
The primary cause of the bug is the `make_current` method being used without being defined within the `initialize` function. Additionally, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might not accurately check if the current IOLoop instance exists.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `make_current` method within the `initialize` function or call the appropriate method to set the current IOLoop.
2. Revise the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current_instance()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current_instance()
```
In this corrected version, assuming that a method named `make_current_instance` is responsible for setting the current IOLoop and it's part of the `IOLoop` class. If not, replace `self.make_current_instance()` with the appropriate method call. The condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance has been revised to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to accurately check for the existence of the current instance.
