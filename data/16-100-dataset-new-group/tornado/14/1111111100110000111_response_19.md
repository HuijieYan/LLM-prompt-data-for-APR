Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The logic for checking if the current IOLoop exists or not is flawed.
2. The handling of the `make_current` parameter is incorrect.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic inside the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should raise an error only if the current IOLoop exists. However, the current implementation is raising an error if the IOLoop is not `None`, which is incorrect.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements inside the `initialize` method. The logic should check whether the current IOLoop exists, and raise an error only if it does exist when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Buggy function (corrected version):
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the second conditional statement was modified to check if the current IOLoop is not `None` and raise an error accordingly when `make_current` is set to `True`.
