The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. It checks if `make_current` is `None` and then proceeds to call `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and `self.make_current()` based on the result. However, it does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` as specified in the test.

The buggy function fails the `test_force_current` test because it does not handle the case of `make_current=True` correctly. It should raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, but it currently does not do that.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `test_force_current` test should pass, as it now correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and raises a `RuntimeError` when necessary.
