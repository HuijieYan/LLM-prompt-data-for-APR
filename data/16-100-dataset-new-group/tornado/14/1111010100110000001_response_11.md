The potential error location within the `initialize` function is that the logic for checking if the current IOLoop exists and potentially making the current IOLoop is flawed, leading to incorrect behavior and the RuntimeError.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the case where `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance. The error message indicates that when attempting to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True`, the function incorrectly raises a RuntimeError because the current IOLoop already exists.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to first check if `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance. If these conditions are met, the function should simply return without making the current IOLoop. If `make_current` is True and there is no current IOLoop instance, then it should proceed to make the current IOLoop. If `make_current` is None or False, it should not attempt to make the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
```
