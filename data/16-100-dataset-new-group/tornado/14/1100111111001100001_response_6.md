The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly handles the `make_current` parameter. 

The buggy function initializes the IOLoop with the `make_current` parameter, which, when set to `True`, should make the current IOLoop instance. However, the logic in the buggy function is flawed, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the current IOLoop instance is correctly made, and when it is set to `False`, the function should not raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test.
