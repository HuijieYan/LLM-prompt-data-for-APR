The buggy function `initialize` is failing because it raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True`, even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance. This behavior contradicts the intended functionality as described in the documentation.

Here's the breakdown of the bug and possible fix:

- Bug:
  - The conditional block `elif make_current:` is triggered when `make_current` is `True`, and it raises a `RuntimeError` if there's no current `IOLoop` instance, which is not the intended behavior according to the documentation.

- Potential fix:
  - Update the conditional block to only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This fix updates the conditional statement to raise a `RuntimeError` only if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, aligning with the intended behavior described in the documentation.
