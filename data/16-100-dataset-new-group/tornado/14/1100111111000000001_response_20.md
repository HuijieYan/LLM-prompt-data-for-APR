## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current(self)  # Fixed the missing argument in make_current function call
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed the condition to check if current IOLoop already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current(self)  # Fixed the missing argument in make_current function call
