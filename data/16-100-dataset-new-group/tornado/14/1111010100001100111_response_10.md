Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` is not handling the case when `make_current` is `False`.
2. The logic for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is not properly handled.

Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop and handling the `make_current` argument is not properly implemented in the `initialize` function. This results in the function incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even when the current IOLoop does not exist in certain cases, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `False`.
2. Revise the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop and make necessary adjustments to ensure it works correctly.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        # Handle the case when make_current is False
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
```
