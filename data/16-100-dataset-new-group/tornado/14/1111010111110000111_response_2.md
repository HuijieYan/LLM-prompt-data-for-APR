The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`. The issue results in the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error message when trying to create a new instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, even when there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if it is not `None`, the `RuntimeError` is raised incorrectly.

To fix this, we can modify the condition inside the `initialize` method to check if `make_current` is `True` and if `IOLoop.current()` is not already the current instance before making it the current instance. Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the suggested change, the `IOLoop` instance will be set as the current instance only if it is not already set as the current instance. This should resolve the bug and make the test function `test_force_current` pass without the `RuntimeError` error.
