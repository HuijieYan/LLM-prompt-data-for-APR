The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing the failing test. The problem arises from the condition `if make_current is None` in the `initialize` function, which incorrectly checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` when `make_current` is true.

After analyzing the failing test, it is clear that when the `make_current` parameter is `True`, the `initialize` function should not check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The goal is to always make the current instance when `make_current` is True.

To fix this bug, the condition `if make_current is None` needs to be separated from the make_current logic and only checked if `make_current` is False. If `make_current` is True, the function should unconditionally make the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function correctly handles the `make_current` parameter, unconditionally making the current instance when `make_current` is True and checking for the existing instance only when `make_current` is False. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
