The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The issue is related to the condition where the `make_current` parameter is not provided. The problem arises when the `make_current` method is called based on the condition if the current `IOLoop` instance is None. If it is indeed None, then `self.make_current()` is called. However, when the `make_current` parameter is not provided, it results in unexpected behavior, which leads to the error message "current IOLoop already exists" being raised, even though the `IOLoop` instance is `None`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional statements within the `initialize` method to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

The corrected version of the `initialize` method is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None and make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional statements to handle the `make_current` parameter explicitly, we can ensure that the `make_current` method is called based on the correct conditions, addressing the bug and passing the failing test.
