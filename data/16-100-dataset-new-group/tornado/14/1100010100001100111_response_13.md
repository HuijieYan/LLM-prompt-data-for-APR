### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the conditional checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance are not properly handled. The `if` condition does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the IOLoop instance already exists, leading to the incorrect raising of a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance need to be adjusted to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the IOLoop instance already exists. Additionally, the branching logic needs to be revised to ensure the correct behavior based on the input parameters.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
