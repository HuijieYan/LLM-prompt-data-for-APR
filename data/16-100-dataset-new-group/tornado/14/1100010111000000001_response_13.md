# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The issue in the buggy function is in the `initialize` method, where the logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop is incorrect. The `make_current` argument is not being handled properly, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `elif make_current` block needs to be inverted. Instead of checking if the current IOLoop is None, it should be checking if it is not None before raising a RuntimeError.

The corrected version of the function uses the correct logical condition to check if the current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make it the current one.

This will resolve the issue and make the function behave as intended, passing the failing test.
