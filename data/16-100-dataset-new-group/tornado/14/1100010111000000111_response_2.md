## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# this is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function lies in the conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition checks if the current IOLoop instance is None before attempting to make it the current instance. However, in the failing test, the `test_force_current` function is checking if a second construction of the IOLoop with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`. The bug occurs because this condition incorrectly allows the second construction to proceed even if the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix this bug, the corrected function now checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before attempting to make it the current instance. This corrects the logic to ensure that a second construction with `make_current=True` will raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
