The buggy function has a condition that checks if the current IOLoop instance is already existing before creating a new one. However, this condition is not properly handling the case when an IOLoop instance already exists. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly, as observed in the failing test.

The issue mentioned on GitHub also points out the same problem, indicating that the condition at line 252 is not functioning as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions remain unchanged

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is modified to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` to properly check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected, passing the failing test.
