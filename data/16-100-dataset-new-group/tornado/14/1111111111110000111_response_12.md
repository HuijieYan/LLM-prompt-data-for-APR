The issue in the buggy function "initialize" in the IOLoop class is that it raises a RuntimeError by checking if the IOLoop.current() is None, and if not, then it raises an error "current IOLoop already exists". This is contradictory and needs to be fixed.

The cause of the bug is that the initialize function is inconsistently checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance. It first checks if the current instance is None to decide if it needs to make the current, but then for make_current=True, it raises an error if the current instance is not None.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the logic for checking if a current IOLoop instance exists so that it is consistent for both conditions (make_current=None and make_current=True). Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of a current IOLoop instance should be moved to the make_current function itself as part of its responsibility.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for raising RuntimeError has been reversed for the make_current=True condition. Now, if make_current is True and the current instance is not None, it will raise the RuntimeError.

This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
