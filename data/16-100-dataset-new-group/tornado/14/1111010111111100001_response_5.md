The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not check if the current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current=True`. This results in the `RuntimeError` being mistakenly raised, as the current `IOLoop` is available.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to make it the current one. If it does exist, then the function should return without raising an error.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before trying to make it the current one. If it already exists, the function will return without raising an error.
