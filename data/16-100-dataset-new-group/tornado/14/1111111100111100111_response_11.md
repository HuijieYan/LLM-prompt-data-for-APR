The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class appears to be related to the logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The `initialize` function takes an optional parameter `make_current` which, when set to `True`, is intended to ensure that the new `IOLoop` becomes the current instance.

The error message indicates that the code is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when it should not. The bug seems to be related to the condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

In the failing test case, the input parameter `make_current` has the value `True`. The relevant variables and their values at the point of failure are:
- `make_current`: `True`
- The current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`

The issue mentioned in the GitHub post aligns with the observed behavior, where the condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be revised to properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. The condition for checking the existence of the current instance needs to be based on the value of `make_current` and whether the current `IOLoop` instance is already set.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:  # make_current is True and current_instance is None
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the value of the current `IOLoop` instance in the `current_instance` variable. Then we adjust the conditional statements to properly check for the existence of the current instance based on the value of `make_current` and the `current_instance`. This should resolve the issue and allow the `initialize` function to work as intended.
