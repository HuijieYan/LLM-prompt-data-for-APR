## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class and is responsible for initializing the IOLoop object. It takes an optional argument `make_current` and checks if an IOLoop instance already exists. If not, it calls the `make_current` method to set the current IOLoop.

## Error Location
The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions that check for the existence of current IOLoop instances and the handling of the `make_current` argument.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument and the condition checks for the current IOLoop instance. The bug leads to an incorrect RuntimeError when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the condition checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance.
2. Update the handling of the `make_current` argument to ensure that it is correctly used to set the current IOLoop.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def __init__(self):
        self.current_instance = None

    def current(self, instance=True):
        # implementation of current method

    def make_current(self):
        self.current(instance=False)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We initialize the `current_instance` to `None` in the `__init__` method.
- We modify the `initialize` method to properly handle the `make_current` argument and check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance.
- We update the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a new IOLoop instance if a current IOLoop already exists.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `initialize` method will correctly handle the `make_current` argument and avoid the incorrect RuntimeError. This should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
