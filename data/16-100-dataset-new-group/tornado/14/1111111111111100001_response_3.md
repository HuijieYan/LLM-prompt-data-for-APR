The bug in the initialize function is causing the failing test because the logic for handling the make_current parameter is incorrect. The make_current parameter is meant to control whether the new IOLoop will become the current IOLoop or not. However, in the current implementation, if make_current=True, it checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does.

This is not the expected behavior, as the intention of make_current=True is to forcefully make the new IOLoop the current instance, regardless of whether a current instance already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the initialize function to handle the make_current parameter properly by removing the check for an existing IOLoop instance when make_current=True and always making the new IOLoop the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
By making this change, the initialize function will now properly handle the make_current parameter and the failing test should pass.
