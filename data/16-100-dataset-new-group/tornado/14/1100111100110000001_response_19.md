The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py` has a conditional logic issue that is causing the test case to fail. 

1. The function is intended to initialize an IOLoop object with the option to force creation of the current IOLoop. It checks if the current IOLoop already exists and then attempts to create it if not. If the `make_current` flag is set to `True`, it should raise an error if the current IOLoop already exists.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current IOLoop and handle the `make_current` flag.

3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised when the `make_current` flag is set to `True` and the current IOLoop already exists.

4. To fix the bug, we should update the conditional logic to properly handle the scenario where `make_current` is set to `True`.

5. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is not None:
            if make_current:
                if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The updated function checks if `make_current` is not `None`, and if it is, it checks if it is `True` and if the current IOLoop exists. If both conditions are met, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This corrected version addresses the conditional logic issue and should pass the failing test.
