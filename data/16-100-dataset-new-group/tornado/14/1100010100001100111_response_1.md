## Bug Explanation

The buggy function `initialize` has a conditional statement that checks the value of `make_current` and the current instance of `IOLoop`. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance of `IOLoop` is not `None`, which results in the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

## Bug Fixing Strategy

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statement to first check if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance of `IOLoop` is not `None`, and only then raise the `RuntimeError` if that condition is met.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
