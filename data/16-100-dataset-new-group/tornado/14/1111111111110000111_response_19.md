The problem with the initialize function in the IOLoop class is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is never True, as the current method is defined but not returning anything. So, the code falls under the `else` condition, and raises `RuntimeError` even if the instance doesn't exist.

To fix this, we need to modify the current method to return an instance if it exists, or set an instance if it doesn't. Then, update the initialize method to use this updated current method.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    ... (same as before)
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if not IOLoop.current():
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current():
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()

    @classmethod
    def current(cls):
        instance = getattr(cls._current, 'instance', None)
        if instance is None:
            if cls._current is None:
                cls._current = cls()
                instance = cls._current.instance
        return instance
```

By adding a class method `current` to the `IOLoop` class, it checks if the instance exists, and if not, initializes a new instance. We use `cls._current` to keep track of the current instance.

This modification resolves the issue raised on GitHub and should now pass the failing test.
