### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` seems to be causing the issue.

### Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be occurring because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not working as expected. This condition is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists or not, and then based on the `make_current` parameter, either create a new instance or raise a RuntimeError. However, it is not functioning as intended, leading to the incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition to check the existence of the current IOLoop instance works correctly. This might involve modifying the condition or handling the logic differently based on the state of the current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, I have stored the current IOLoop instance in a variable `current_instance` and then used this variable in the conditional statements. This ensures that the current IOLoop instance is checked and used consistently throughout the function.
