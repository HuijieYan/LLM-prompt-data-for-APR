## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is checking whether an IOLoop instance already exists and then either making the current IOLoop or raising a RuntimeError if an IOLoop already exists. The error message indicates that there is a RuntimeError being raised when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The GitHub issue points out that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` on line 252 is resulting in a RuntimeError being raised, which seems contradictory.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` not behaving as expected. This condition is supposed to check whether an IOLoop instance already exists, but it is incorrectly evaluating to False even when no IOLoop exists, leading to the RuntimeError being raised when `make_current` is set to `True`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to correctly check whether an IOLoop instance already exists and handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if IOLoop instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
