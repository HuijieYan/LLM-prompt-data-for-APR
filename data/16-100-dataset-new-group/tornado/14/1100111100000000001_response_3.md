The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. The potential error locations within the function are in the conditions of the if-else statements.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance, but it is not properly handling the case when an instance already exists. 

The strategy for fixing the bug is to first check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists before trying to create a new one. If an instance already exists, then it should not be created again. If an instance does not exist, then it should be created.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
