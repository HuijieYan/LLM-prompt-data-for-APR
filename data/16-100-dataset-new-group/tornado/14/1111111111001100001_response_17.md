The bug in the `initialize` function occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. The buggy function does not handle the case where a `make_current=True` construction cannot succeed. As a result, the test function `test_force_current` is failing.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, then a `RuntimeError` should be raised.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
