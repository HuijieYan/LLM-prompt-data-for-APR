## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# this is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adding an "else" statement and modifying the condition in the "elif" block, we ensure that the correct error is raised when the IOLoop already exists, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
