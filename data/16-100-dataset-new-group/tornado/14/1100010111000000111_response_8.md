## The corrected version of the function
```python

# This is the corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

## Explanation and strategy for fixing the bug
The issue in the original code is with the condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists. The original code checks for None, and then raises an error if it is not None, which is the opposite of what is expected.

To fix the bug, the condition in the elif statement should be changed to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None, and then raise an error. This will correctly handle the case when the IOLoop instance already exists and prevent the RuntimeError from being raised when it shouldn't.

By making this simple change, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
