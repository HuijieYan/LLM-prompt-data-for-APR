The bug in the function `initialize` is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function is incorrectly checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None`. If it is not `None`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that "current IOLoop already exists".

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop instance is not None
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` before attempting to raise a `RuntimeError`.

This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
