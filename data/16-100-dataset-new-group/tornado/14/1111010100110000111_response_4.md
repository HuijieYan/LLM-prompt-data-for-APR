## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class does not handle the case where `make_current` is not provided, resulting in an error when attempting to make the loop current. This error was reported in GitHub issue `ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None`.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are the condition where `make_current` is None and where `make_current` is True.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs because when `make_current` is None, the code attempts to make the loop current without checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This leads to the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Suggested Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we will modify the `initialize` function to always check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make the loop current. If `make_current` is None, it will still check for an existing instance and make the loop current if one does not exist.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In this corrected version, if `make_current` is None, the function will check for an existing `IOLoop` instance and make the loop current if one does not exist. If `make_current` is not None, it will raise an error if a current `IOLoop` already exists, otherwise it will make the loop current.
