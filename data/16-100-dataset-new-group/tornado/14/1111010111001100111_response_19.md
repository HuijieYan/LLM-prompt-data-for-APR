## Corrections and Explanations

The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue with checking if the current `IOLoop` already exists. The problem is with the logic that checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue is related to the `make_current` parameter and how it interacts with the current instance of `IOLoop`.

The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if it is the current `IOLoop` instance. It also ensures that a second attempt to create a current `IOLoop` instance fails with a `RuntimeError`.

The GitHub issue further emphasizes that there is confusion about the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` check and the logic for raising "already exists" error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The fix strategy involves updating the `initialize` method to correctly handle the scenario when `make_current` is set to `True`.

1. If `make_current` is `None`, then it should check if there is no current instance and then call `self.make_current()`.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, it should directly call `self.make_current()` and raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance.

### Corrected Version

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other code...

    # Corrected initialize method
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` method should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly, as per the intended logic, and pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
