The issue with the function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is that it is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if not, make the current instance. However, when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when an IOLoop instance doesn't exist.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement in the function `initialize` is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional statements within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance does not exist.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first check for the current instance of IOLoop and then perform the appropriate action based on the value of `make_current`. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
