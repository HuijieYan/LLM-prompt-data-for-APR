The bug in the `initialize` function is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised when `make_current` is set to `True`. The function is incorrectly checking if the current IOLoop is `None`, and if it is, it raises the error. However, it should only raise the error if the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to check if the IOLoop is already the current one before attempting to make it the current one.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This correction checks if the current IOLoop exists before attempting to make it the current one. It should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
