The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the `IOLoop` class. It is meant to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance if `make_current` is `True` or if the current instance does not exist. However, there are potential error locations in the function.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. Incorrect use of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
2. Incorrect logic for checking the current instance and making it current.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not checking for the case where `make_current` is `False`, and it is not handling the logic for making the instance current properly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle all the different cases of `make_current` and the current instance correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
  def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            make_current = True
        
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
```
