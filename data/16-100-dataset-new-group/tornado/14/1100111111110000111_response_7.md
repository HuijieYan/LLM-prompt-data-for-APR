## The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The buggy code had a logical error in the `if` condition checking whether `IOLoop.current` is `None`. The condition should check if it is not `None` before calling `self.make_current()`. Additionally, the condition for `elif` checking if `make_current` is `True` should also compare it to `True`.

The corrected version of the code above should resolve the issue and allow the test to pass.
