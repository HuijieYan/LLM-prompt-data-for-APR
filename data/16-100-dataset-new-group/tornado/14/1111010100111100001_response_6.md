### Bug Analysis
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is failing because when `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist, and then raises a `RuntimeError` instead of setting the current instance.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the conditional statement `if make_current` where the `initialize` function incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist, and raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is the incorrect logic within the `if make_current` conditional statement. The function should set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True`, but it incorrectly checks if the current instance does not exist and then raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Fix Strategy
The fix strategy involves modifying the conditional statement to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` by setting the current `IOLoop` instance, and removing the unnecessary check for the non-existence of the current instance.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```
