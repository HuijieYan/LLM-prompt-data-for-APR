## The Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:  # Fixed comparison to check for True
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed condition to check if current IOLoop already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By comparing the original `initialize` function with the failing test, it was identified that the comparison and conditions were not in line with the requirements. The comparison for `make_current` needed to be checked against `True` and the condition for existing IOLoop needed to be reversed.

The corrected version is updated above to handle these issues and should now pass the failing test.
