The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is True, it should check if an IOLoop instance already exists before setting the current IOLoop. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling this condition, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the buggy function should be modified to first check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to set the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is True, it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If an instance exists, it raises a RuntimeError, and if not, it sets the current IOLoop.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_force_current` passes.
