The problem with the `initialize` function is that it checks whether a current instance of `IOLoop` exists and then raises an error if there is already a current instance, even if `make_current` is set to `True`. This is contradictory to the intended behavior, which is to make the current instance of `IOLoop`, if it does not exist.

The function should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be updated to check if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists, in which case it should raise an error. If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, it should make the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
