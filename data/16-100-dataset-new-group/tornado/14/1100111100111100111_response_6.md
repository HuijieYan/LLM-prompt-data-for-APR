## Correction of the Bug

The bug occurs in the `initialize()` function of the `IOLoop` class. The bug is caused by the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` being evaluated as `False` when it should be `True`. This condition is incorrectly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the condition to check for the absence of the current IOLoop instance, and properly initialize the IOLoop when `make_current` is `None` or `True`.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We first store the current instance of IOLoop in the `current_instance` variable.
- In the `if` condition, we check if `make_current` is `None` and the `current_instance` is `None`, then we call `self.make_current()` to create a new IOLoop instance.
- In the `elif` condition, we check if `make_current` is `True` and the `current_instance` is not `None`, then we raise a `RuntimeError` since the current IOLoop already exists.

With this correction, the `initialize()` function should now work as expected and pass the failing test.
