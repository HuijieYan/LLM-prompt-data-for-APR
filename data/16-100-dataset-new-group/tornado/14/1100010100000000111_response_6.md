Based on the provided buggy function and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug occurs because of the improper handling of the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current IOLoop instance.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions for `make_current` being `None` or `True`, and the subsequent logic based on the check for the current IOLoop instance.

The bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a RuntimeError even when the current IOLoop instance is None, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check for the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if `make_current` is `True` and then verify if the current IOLoop instance exists or not before raising a RuntimeError. This ensures that the function behaves as expected and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
