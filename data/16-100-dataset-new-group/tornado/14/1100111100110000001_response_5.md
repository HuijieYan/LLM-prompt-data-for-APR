The problem in the provided function is that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is incorrect. This causes the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" to be raised incorrectly. 

Here's the correct version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```
