### Analysis
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class has a bug causing it to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the `IOLoop.current` instance is `None`. This behavior is opposite to what is expected, as it should raise the error when the current instance already exists.

The bug seems to be within the `initialize` function, specifically in the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the conditional logic inside the `initialize` function is incorrect. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then raise an error if it does. Conversely, when `make_current` is `None`, it should make the current instance if it does not already exist.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by reversing the conditional logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, check if the current instance exists and raise an error if it does. When `make_current` is `None`, make the current instance if it does not already exist.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other methods and class declarations

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the conditional logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is modified to ensure that the correct behavior is triggered based on the value of `make_current`.
