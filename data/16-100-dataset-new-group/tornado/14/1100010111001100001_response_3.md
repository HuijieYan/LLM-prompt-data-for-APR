The buggy function `initialize` is not correctly handling the case where `make_current` is `True`. The function first checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if it is, it proceeds to call `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is not `None`, the function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if it is, it raises a RuntimeError. This logic does not cover the case where `make_current` is `True`.

The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if it is the current instance using `IOLoop.current()`. It also verifies that a second `make_current=True` construction should not succeed.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`. We should also ensure that the `IOLoop.current()` is updated correctly based on the value of `make_current`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if `make_current is True` and handle this case separately from the case where `make_current is None`. We also ensure that the current `IOLoop` is properly updated based on the value of `make_current`.
