After analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The problem arises in the conditional check for the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, due to the conditional statement, the check for an existing instance is not performed, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is performed when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions and class implementation)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `elif` condition is removed, and the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is performed in the `else` block when `make_current` is set to `True`. This ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is an existing instance of `IOLoop`.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_force_current` passes without raising a `RuntimeError`.
