The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing the failing test. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and the `IOLoop.current` check is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even though it should not.

The bug occurs because the logic within the `initialize` function is incorrectly checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raising a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't. This is due to the conditional checks not working as intended.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks in the `initialize` function need to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The correction involves adjusting the `if` and `elif` statements to only check for the conditions that matter and remove the redundant checks. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
