The cause of the bug in the `initialize` function is that the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect. When `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current `IOLoop`, but it currently tries to raise an error if the current `IOLoop` already exists. This is contradictory to the intended behavior based on the error message from the failing test.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function should be modified:
- When `make_current` is `None`, it should check if there is no current `IOLoop`, and if so, make the current `IOLoop`. The logic for this part is correct.
- When `make_current` is `True`, it should simply set the current `IOLoop`, without trying to raise an error if it already exists.

Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the function will successfully set the current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True`, and when `make_current` is `None`, it will also continue to work as expected. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
