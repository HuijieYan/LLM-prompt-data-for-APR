The buggy function `initialize` in the file `tornado/ioloop.py` initializes an IOLoop instance. The error message from the failing test indicates that when initializing the IOLoop with `make_current=True`, a RuntimeError is raised because "current IOLoop already exists".

The cause of the bug is in the conditional logic of the `initialize` function:
- When `make_current` is provided:
  - First, it checks if there is no current IOLoop. If there is none, it sets the current IOLoop.
  - Then, it raises a RuntimeError if there is already a current IOLoop.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the current IOLoop is checked and set atomically or using a lock, so that the state does not change in between these two operations.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The key change here is in the second `if` statement under the `elif make_current` block. It now checks if the current IOLoop is not None (i.e., it exists) before proceeding to set the current IOLoop.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
