The buggy function `initialize` is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. It is not checking if `make_current` is `True` or `False` and is not calling the `make_current` function accordingly.

The bug occurs because the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. It is not checking if `make_current` is `True` or `False` and is not calling the `make_current` function accordingly. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors, as it is not properly controlling the current `IOLoop`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and call the `make_current` function based on its value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we have modified the `if` condition in the `elif` block to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=True)` is not `None`, and then we call `self.make_current()` accordingly. This will handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and prevent any unexpected behavior.
