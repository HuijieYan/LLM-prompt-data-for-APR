## Error
The buggy function `initialize` is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly. It is not setting the current `IOLoop` instance as expected.

## Bug Cause
The `initialize` function is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance, but it has a conditional check that is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. This is causing the current `IOLoop` instance to not be set correctly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to ensure that the `initialize` function correctly sets the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. It should check if a current instance exists and then either make the new instance current or raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
