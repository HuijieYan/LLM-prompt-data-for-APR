The bug in the `initialize` function is that if `make_current` is `True`, it is not handling the case where the current `IOLoop` already exists.

To fix the bug, we should check if an instance of `IOLoop` is already the current `IOLoop` before trying to make the current `IOLoop`. If it already exists, then we should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass.
