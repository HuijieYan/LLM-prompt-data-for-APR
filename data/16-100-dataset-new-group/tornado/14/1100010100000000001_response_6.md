# The buggy function doesn't define the IOLoop class and its current() method, so it is difficult to identify the potential error locations without additional context.
# However, it seems that the function is trying to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if it doesn't exist already, but it's not handling the case when make_current is False.

# To fix the bug, we can add an else statement to handle the case when make_current is False.

# Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        # handle the case when make_current is False
        pass
```
In the corrected version, we added an else statement to handle the case when make_current is False. We can add the necessary code inside the else block to handle this case based on the requirements.
