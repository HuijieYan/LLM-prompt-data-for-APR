#### Correction:

The buggy function is failing to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised in the failing test case.

The issue arises from the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class where the conditional checks for the `make_current` parameter are not correctly handling the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks in the `initialize` method to properly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The `make_current` parameter is defaulted to `False` to avoid confusion with `None` values.
- The conditional check for `make_current` properly handles the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `initialize` method should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
