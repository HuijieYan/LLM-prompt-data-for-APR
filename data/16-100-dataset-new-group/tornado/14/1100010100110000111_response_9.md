Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it is not checking the condition properly before raising the RuntimeError. The function should be checking if the current IOLoop does not exist before trying to make it the current loop, or if `make_current` is True, then the current IOLoop should exist before making it.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional statements to ensure that the correct checks are being made before attempting to make the IOLoop current.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` has been modified to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to check if the current IOLoop exists before making it the current loop. Additionally, the condition `if make_current:` has been moved inside the `else` block to ensure that it is only checked when `make_current` is not None.
