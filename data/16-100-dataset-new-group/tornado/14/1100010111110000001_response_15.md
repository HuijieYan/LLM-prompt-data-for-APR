The buggy function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is the `initialize` method. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is True, and the current IOLoop already exists, a RuntimeError is raised. The failing test in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` tries to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True`, but it is expecting a RuntimeError to be raised.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop exists when `make_current` is True, but it does not check if it already exists when `make_current` is None.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should check if the current IOLoop already exists in both cases - when `make_current` is None and when `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version checks if the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is None or True, and raises a RuntimeError if it does. This ensures that the test case `test_force_current` will pass without any errors.
