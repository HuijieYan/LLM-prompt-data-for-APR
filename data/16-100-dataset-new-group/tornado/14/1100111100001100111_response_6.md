The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not properly checking the condition for whether the IOLoop.current instance already exists or not. This is resulting in the incorrect behavior and the RuntimeError being raised prematurely.

The cause of the bug is that the code checks if `make_current` is None and if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, in the elif condition, if `make_current` is True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, it raises a RuntimeError. This logic is flawed because it does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, as the intention seems to be to make the current IOLoop instance if it does not exist, not raise an error.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be modified to handle the case where `make_current` is True and the IOLoop.current instance does not exist, by creating the current IOLoop instance instead of raising a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                # Create the current IOLoop instance if it does not exist
                self.make_current()
            else:
                # Handle the case when make_current is True but the IOLoop.current instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
