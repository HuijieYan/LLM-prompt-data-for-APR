To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is correctly used to determine whether a current IOLoop instance already exists. We should also ensure that the current IOLoop instance is properly set based on the value of `make_current`.

The bug in the current code is that if `make_current` is `True`, the code checks if no current IOLoop instance exists and then proceeds to raise an error if a current instance does not exist. This behavior is contradictory and leads to the RuntimeError being raised inappropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` argument and the current existence of an IOLoop instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if not current_instance:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
1. We store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in `current_instance`.
2. In the logic for `make_current` being `None`, we check if `current_instance` does not exist and then proceed with making the current instance.
3. In the logic for `make_current` being `True`, we check if `current_instance` exists and then raise an error if it does, otherwise, we proceed with making the current instance.

This corrected logic ensures that the `make_current` argument is correctly handled, and the RuntimeError is only raised when necessary.

With this correction, the `initialize` function will pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
