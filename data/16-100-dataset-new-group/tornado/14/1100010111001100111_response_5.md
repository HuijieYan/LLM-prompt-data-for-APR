The issue is related to the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The problem is that when `make_current` is set to True, the function should check if an IOLoop instance already exists before making it current. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The conditional check for `make_current` being True or None.
2. The check for the current IOLoop instance.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is set to True, the function does not properly check if an IOLoop current instance already exists. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised even when the current instance does not exist.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the current IOLoop instance already exists before making it current. If it does, it should not raise a RuntimeError.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
