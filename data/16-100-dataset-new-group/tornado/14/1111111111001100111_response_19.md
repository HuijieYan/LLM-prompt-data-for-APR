The issue is caused by the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The function is intended to initialize the IOLoop and handle the `make_current` argument. However, there is a bug in the logic that checks if an IOLoop instance already exists.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance, and depending on the value of `make_current`, it may raise a `RuntimeError` even when the current IOLoop is not present.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current IOLoop instance. Additionally, the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` should be adjusted to accurately reflect the state of the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the `make_current` argument and correctly check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance.

The fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the `initialize` function behaves as expected, allowing the failing test to pass.
