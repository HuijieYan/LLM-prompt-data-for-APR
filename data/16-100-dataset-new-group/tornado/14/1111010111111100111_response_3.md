The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object and possibly make it the current IOLoop. However, the bug occurs when `make_current=True`, and the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`.

The potential error in the buggy function is in the `if make_current` block, where it checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None`. This check is incorrect because if `make_current=True`, it should check if the current IOLoop instance already exists rather than not existing.

The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional statement in the `if make_current` block. It checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` when it should check if it is not `None`, and then raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement in the `if make_current` block needs to be inverted. It should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, and then raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test. The `if make_current` block now checks if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` and correctly raises a `RuntimeError` if it already exists.
