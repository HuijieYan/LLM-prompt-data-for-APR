The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. The function checks if `make_current` is `None` and then attempts to make the current `IOLoop` if there is currently no current `IOLoop` instance. However, when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, it should raise an error if there is already a current instance.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if one exists. If `make_current` is not provided (i.e., `None`), it should make the current `IOLoop` if there is currently no current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the provided failing test case for the `test_force_current` function should pass.
