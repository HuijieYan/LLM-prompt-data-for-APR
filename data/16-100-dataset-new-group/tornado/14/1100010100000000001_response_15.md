## Analysis of the buggy function
The initialize function is meant to initialize the IOLoop, but it contains some logic that may produce unexpected results.

## Potential error locations
1. The condition `if make_current is None` checks if make_current is None, but it should likely be checking if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None.
2. The logic seems to be redundant in the else block as it performs the same check as the if block.

## Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the logic in the initialize function is not correctly checking if the IOLoop is already initialized or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially raise a RuntimeError when it should not.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the conditionals need to be re-evaluated to ensure that the IOLoop is properly initialized and the RuntimeError is only raised when necessary.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
