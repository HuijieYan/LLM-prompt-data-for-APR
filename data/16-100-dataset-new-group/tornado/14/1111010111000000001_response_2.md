## Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance and setting it as the current instance if `make_current` is True.

## Potential Error locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` is not handling the case where `make_current` is False.
2. The `self.make_current()` method needs to be properly handled to set the current `IOLoop` instance.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `initialize` function causes issues when attempting to make the `IOLoop` current. The logic does not handle the case where `make_current` is False, and the `self.make_current()` method is not being called properly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the value of `make_current` and handle the cases where it is True, False, or None.
2. Properly call the `self.make_current()` method to set the current `IOLoop` instance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other code...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current == True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With these changes, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and set the current `IOLoop` instance as expected.
