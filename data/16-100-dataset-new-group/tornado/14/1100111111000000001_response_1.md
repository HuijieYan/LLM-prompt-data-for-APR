## Analysis
The initialize function in the IOLoop class is checking for the current IOLoop instance and trying to create a new one if it doesn't exist. However, there are issues with the logic inside the initialize function, leading to the failing test.

## Identified potential error locations
1. The conditional check for make_current is not properly handled.
2. The logic for checking if the current IOLoop exists is flawed.

## Cause of the bug
The buggy initialize function does not correctly handle the make_current parameter. It also does not properly determine if an instance of IOLoop already exists, leading to the failing test case.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the conditional check for make_current to ensure that the logic is executed correctly based on the parameter value.
2. Verify the existence of the current IOLoop instance using the current() function.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:  # Update the conditional check
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix the logic for checking current IOLoop
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
After making the above corrections, the failing test "test_force_current" should pass successfully.
