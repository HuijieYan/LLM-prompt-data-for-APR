The cause of the bug is that the initialize function is not properly checking for an existing current IOLoop instance before trying to create a new one when make_current=True is passed as an argument.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the initialize function to properly handle the make_current argument.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    # ... (other functions)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            # check if current IOLoop already exists
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

By adding the condition to check if the current IOLoop already exists for the make_current=True case, we prevent the creation of a new IOLoop instance and appropriately raise a RuntimeError if one already exists. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
