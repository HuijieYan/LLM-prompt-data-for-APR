The bug in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is causing an issue where the method is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The cause of this bug is that the `initialize` method checks for an existing `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and based on the value of `make_current`, it should either create a new `IOLoop` instance or raise an error if an instance already exists. However, the condition checking for an existing instance is not working correctly, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the condition for checking the existence of an `IOLoop` instance is correctly evaluated. We can modify the condition to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before raising the `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we have modified the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the `initialize` method behave as expected.
