## Corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The buggy function had a logic error in the `initialize` function. It first checked if `make_current` is None and then called `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if the current instance exists. However, if `make_current` is not None, it did not follow the same logic and directly checked if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This inconsistency in logic caused the bug.

To fix the bug, I have corrected the logic to consistently check if the current instance exists based on the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is True, it checks if the current instance exists, and if `make_current` is False, it checks if the current instance does not exist. Additionally, the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` has been updated to match the corrected logic.
