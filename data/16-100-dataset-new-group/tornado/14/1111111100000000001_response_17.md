The main issue with the `initialize` function is the conditional logic in the `if` and `elif` blocks. It seems that the intention of the function is to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current instance, if specified. However, the current logic does not achieve this goal effectively and can lead to unexpected behavior.

The potential error locations are:
1. The `if` block where `make_current is None` is not properly handled.
2. The logic to check if the current IOLoop instance exists is not clear.

The cause of the bug is primarily related to the conditional logic and the usage of the `make_current` argument. The `initialize` function is supposed to make a new IOLoop the current instance, but the conditional checks are not performing this task correctly.

A strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary calls to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the `initialize` function, and rely on the `make_current` argument to determine whether to make the new IOLoop the current instance.
2. Handle the cases where `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or `False` explicitly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    # Add an else block to handle the case where make_current is False
    else:
        # Some alternative logic or default behavior when make_current is False
        pass
```

In the corrected version, the `make_current` argument is used directly to determine whether to make the new IOLoop the current instance. The conditional logic is simplified, and the potential for unintended behavior is reduced.
