Based on the failing test and the provided runtime values, it seems that the bug is in the logic of the `initialize` function in `IOLoop` class. The function is checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists and if not, it is trying to set it as the current instance.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, where it checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` and if not, it raises a RuntimeError. However, this logic is incorrect because it should check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` before raising the error.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`. The condition should check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` before raising the RuntimeError.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # other functions

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if not None
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, the bug is fixed. This change ensures that the RuntimeError is only raised if the current IOLoop instance already exists, as intended. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
