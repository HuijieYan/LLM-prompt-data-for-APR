The buggy function `initialize` is meant to initialize the IOLoop object with the option to make it the current IOLoop. The potential error here is that the function is using the `make_current` method without checking if it exists or is available. Additionally, the logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop is not implemented correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `make_current` method is called without proper validation, and the logic for setting the current IOLoop is not handled effectively.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to check if the `make_current` method exists, then set the current IOLoop based on its availability.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the `make_current` method is `None`, and then proceed to check if there is a current instance of IOLoop. If not, we call `self.make_current()` to set the current instance.
If `make_current` is `True`, then we check if there is already a current instance and raise an error if one exists. Otherwise, we call `self.make_current()` to set the current instance. This strategy ensures that the current IOLoop is set correctly based on the specified options.
