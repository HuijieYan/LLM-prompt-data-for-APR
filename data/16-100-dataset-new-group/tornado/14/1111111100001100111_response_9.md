The potential error in the buggy function is the conditional statement `if make_current is None:`. This statement checks if the `make_current` parameter is None, and if true, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None and then calls `self.make_current()`.

The cause of the bug is that the logic inside the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is None and the current instance of `IOLoop` is also None. In this case, it should call `self.make_current()` but it does not.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is None and the current instance of `IOLoop` is also None.

Here's a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first save the current instance of `IOLoop` in the `current_instance` variable. Then, in the conditional statements, we use this variable to check the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and take appropriate actions based on the value of `make_current`.

This should address the issue reported on GitHub and handle the different cases of `make_current` and the current instance of `IOLoop` correctly.
