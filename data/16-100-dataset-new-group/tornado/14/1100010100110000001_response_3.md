The bug in the `initialize` function is causing a RuntimeError with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when the `make_current` parameter is set to True.

The bug occurs because when `make_current` is True, the function should check if an IOLoop already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. However, the current implementation of the function is not handling this case correctly, resulting in the RuntimeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and an IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` when `make_current` is True, and raised a RuntimeError if an IOLoop already exists. This should fix the bug and prevent the RuntimeError that was occurring in the failing test.
