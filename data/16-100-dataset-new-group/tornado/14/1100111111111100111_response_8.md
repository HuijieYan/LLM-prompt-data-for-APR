To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we need to ensure that the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is correct.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. The function is intended to initialize the IOLoop and possibly make it the current instance. However, the current logic does not handle the `make_current` parameter correctly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised when it shouldn't.

The bug becomes apparent in the failing test `test_force_current`, where creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` raises a RuntimeError, even though it should not.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The strategy to fix the bug involves ensuring that the `make_current` parameter is correctly handled within the `initialize` function. This can be achieved by checking whether an IOLoop instance already exists and only making it the current instance if it doesn't. Additionally, raising a RuntimeError should only occur when a new IOLoop instance is being created while another current instance already exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other methods and functions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter has been updated. It now checks if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True` is provided, and raises a RuntimeError only in that case. Additionally, the `make_current` call is only made if an instance does not already exist when `make_current` is not specified.

This corrected version should address the bug and allow the `test_force_current` test to pass.
