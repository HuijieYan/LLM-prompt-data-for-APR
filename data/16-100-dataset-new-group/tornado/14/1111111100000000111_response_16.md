Analysis:
The buggy function 'initialize' in the IOLoop class is designed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists and make it current if not. It accepts a 'make_current' argument, which should control whether the new IOLoop instance should try to become the current instance and raise an error if one already exists. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the logic related to checking the current IOLoop instance.


Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect condition check for 'make_current' argument.
2. Incorrect logic for checking if the current IOLoop instance exists.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be in the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The 'initialize' function should handle the 'make_current' argument to make sure it correctly determines whether the current IOLoop instance exists and whether to make the new instance current.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance should be revised. If the 'make_current' argument is provided, it should be used to determine the behavior for making the new instance current. Additionally, the branching condition should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly handles all scenarios.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first obtain the current instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then, based on the value of the 'make_current' argument, we handle the logic for making the new instance current or raising an error if one already exists. The condition checks have been revised to accurately handle the different scenarios.
