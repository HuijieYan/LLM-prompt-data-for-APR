The buggy function is the `initialize` method in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file of the Tornado library.

Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` and the subsequent `self.make_current()` may not be handling the case properly when `make_current` is `True`.
2. The condition `elif make_current` might not be triggering when `make_current` is `True`.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True`. The first `if` statement checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it attempts to make the current IOLoop. However, when `make_current` is `True`, it should be handled differently. It seems that the `elif make_current` condition is not being triggered, causing the subsequent code to incorrectly raise a RuntimeError.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the conditions to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` separately. This will ensure that the correct logic is applied based on the value of `make_current`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    # Check for True separately
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we handle the case when `make_current` is `True` separately and perform the necessary actions based on that condition.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
