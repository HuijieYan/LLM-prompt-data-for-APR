## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `None` and then calls `self.make_current()` without any condition.
2. The `initialize` function also checks for `make_current` being `True` and then raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

## Explanation of the Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, it does not check if the instance of `IOLoop` already exists before making it current. If `make_current` is `True`, it incorrectly checks if the instance exists and raises an error if it does not. This behavior does not match the intended functionality of the `IOLoop` class, leading to the failing test case.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `make_current` is `None` and only make the `IOLoop` instance current if it does not already exist.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, simply make the `IOLoop` instance current without checking for its existence.

## Corrected Version of the initialize function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will correctly handle both cases of `make_current` and pass the failing test.
