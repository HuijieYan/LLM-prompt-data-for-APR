The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not properly checking whether the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make a new one current.

The failing test `test_force_current` attempts to create a new `IOLoop` and make it the current instance with the `make_current=True` argument. It then checks that attempting to create another current instance raises a `RuntimeError`. However, the original implementation does not properly handle this case and does not prevent the creation of multiple current instances.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should first check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and only attempt to make a new one current if one does not already exist. If `make_current` is `True`, it should ensure that a current instance already exists.

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `initialize` function first checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `None` or `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists. Then, it follows the original logic to make the new `IOLoop` instance current if needed.

This fix ensures that the `initialize` function correctly handles the scenario where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, preventing the creation of multiple current instances.
