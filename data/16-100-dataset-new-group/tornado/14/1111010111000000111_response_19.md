## Analysis
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize the IOLoop with the option to make it the current IOLoop. The issue on GitHub points out that there is a inconsistency in the behavior of line 252 in `ioloop.py`, where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for None, and an error is raised if it is None.

## Potential Error Location
The issue seems to be related to the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and how it is being handled.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug appears to be related to the conditional check of `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` without considering the value of `make_current` in the `initialize` function. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by checking the value of `make_current` before deciding whether to raise an error or make the IOLoop the current instance.

## Corrected Version

    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    We use ``epoll`` (Linux) or ``kqueue`` (BSD and Mac OS X) if they
    are available, or else we fall back on select(). If you are
    implementing a system that needs to handle thousands of
    simultaneous connections, you should use a system that supports
    either ``epoll`` or ``kqueue``.
    
    Example usage for a simple TCP server:
    
    .. testcode::
    
        import errno
        import functools
        import tornado.ioloop
        import socket
    
        def connection_ready(sock, fd, events):
            while True:
                try:
                    connection, address = sock.accept()
                except socket.error as e:
                    if e.args[0] not in (errno.EWOULDBLOCK, errno.EAGAIN):
                        raise
                    return
                connection.setblocking(0)
                handle_connection(connection, address)
    
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
            sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
            sock.setblocking(0)
            sock.bind(("", port))
            sock.listen(128)
    
            io_loop = tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()
            callback = functools.partial(connection_ready, sock)
            io_loop.add_handler(sock.fileno(), callback, io_loop.READ)
            io_loop.start()
    
    .. testoutput::

    By default, a newly-constructed `IOLoop` becomes the thread's current
    `IOLoop`, unless there already is a current `IOLoop`. This behavior
    can be controlled with the ``make_current`` argument to the `IOLoop`
    constructor: if ``make_current=True``, the new `IOLoop` will always
    try to become current and it raises an error if there is already a
    current instance. If ``make_current=False``, the new `IOLoop` will
    not try to become current.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 4.2
       Added the ``make_current`` keyword argument to the `IOLoop`
       constructor.
    """




    # The corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the function adds an additional check for `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `elif make_current` block to ensure that a RuntimeError is only raised if a current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is true. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the test case `test_force_current` to pass.
