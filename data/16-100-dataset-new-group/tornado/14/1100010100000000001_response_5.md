## Analysis of the buggy function:
The initialize function checks if the make_current argument is provided. If it is not provided, it then checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and if not, calls the make_current function. If make_current is provided and is True, it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and if not, raises a RuntimeError. If make_current is provided and is False, it does nothing.

## Potential error locations:
1. The condition for checking if make_current is None may not be working as expected.
2. The condition for checking if make_current is True may not be working as expected.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the code may occur due to the incorrect handling of the make_current argument. It looks like the intention is to call make_current if it is not provided or if it is True. However, the current implementation does not handle these cases correctly and may result in unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the conditions to properly handle the make_current argument. We should also ensure that the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance is correct.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
