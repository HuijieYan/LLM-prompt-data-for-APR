The buggy function `initialize` is designed to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and create a new one if necessary. However, the issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, it does not check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance, but simply sets the current `IOLoop` instance to the current one if it exists, and creates a new one if it does not.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        self.make_current()
```

This updated version eliminates the unnecessary conditional check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, and just proceeds with setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
