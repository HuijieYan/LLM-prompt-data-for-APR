The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is failing the test case `test_force_current` because it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True`. The expected behavior is to make the current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if there is already a current instance.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` incorrectly checks for the absence of a current `IOLoop` instance in both branches of the `if-else` statement. This leads to the erroneous `RuntimeError` being raised when it should instead proceed to set the current `IOLoop`.

To fix the bug, the condition should only check for the absence of a current instance when `make_current` is `True`. When `make_current` is `None`, the function should proceed to make the current `IOLoop` if there isn't one. If `make_current` is `False`, the function should not attempt to make the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function now correctly checks for the absence of a current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True`, and sets the current instance only if there isn't one.
