### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. In this case, the function is intended to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is none, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the current implementation does not properly handle this logic, causing it to fail to raise the error when needed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if one already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we fixed the condition in the `elif` block to properly check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.
