The buggy function `initialize` is checking if `make_current` is None and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, then calling `self.make_current()`. However, the `IOLoop.current` call is referencing the class method instead of the global function, which is likely causing the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to reference the global function `current` instead of the class method `IOLoop.current`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
