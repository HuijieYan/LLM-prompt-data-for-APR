The bug is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. It determines the behavior of the `IOLoop` instance creation and current state.

The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current` as `True`, without unsetting the current instance, and expects it to raise a `RuntimeError`.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, it throws the `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, but it should also set itself as the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `None`.

The fix strategy is to modify the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` argument correctly. When `make_current` is `None`, it should set the current instance; when it is `True`, it should check if a current instance already exists before setting the current instance. If found, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
