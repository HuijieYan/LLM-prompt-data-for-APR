The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` if it is not already set, and it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is `True`. However, the failing test `test_force_current` is not working as expected and raises a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function incorrectly checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance. It should only allow the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` already. However, the current implementation wrongly raises a `RuntimeError` when it should not.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to only check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. If there is a current instance and `make_current` is `True`, then it should raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it should proceed to make the current instance if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected implementation, the failing test should now pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
