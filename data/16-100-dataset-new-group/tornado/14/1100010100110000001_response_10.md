The cause of the bug: the current IOLoop is being checked twice, and the second check is causing the error to be raised.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Remove the second check for the current IOLoop and only make the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
