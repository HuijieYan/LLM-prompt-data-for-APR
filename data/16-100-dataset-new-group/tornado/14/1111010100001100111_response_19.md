## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` might not be evaluating correctly.

## Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect evaluation of the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:`. This is leading to the incorrect behavior of the function, resulting in raising a "current IOLoop already exists" error when it should not.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
It seems that the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` condition is not working as expected. The condition is supposed to check if there is a current IOLoop instance, but it may not be returning the correct result. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the implementation of the `IOLoop.current` method and ensure that it correctly returns the current IOLoop instance.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
