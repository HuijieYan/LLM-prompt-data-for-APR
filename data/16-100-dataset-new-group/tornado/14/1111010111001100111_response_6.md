The potential error in the buggy function is that the logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop instance is not correctly implemented.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current=True`, the function checks if the current IOLoop instance is none, and if it is not, it raises a `RuntimeError` instead of setting the current instance.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is `True`, and then check if the current instance already exists. If it does, we raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we set the current instance as expected.
