In the buggy function `initialize`, there are a few potential error locations:
1. The function is checking `if make_current is None`, but it's supposed to be checking `if make_current is None`.
2. The logic inside the `if make_current is None` block and `elif make_current` block seems to be incorrect.

The buggy function is causing the error message because it is not handling the conditions properly. When `make_current` is None, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if it is, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, in the next `elif make_current` block, it again checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if it is not None, it raises a RuntimeError. This is contradictory logic because if it was None in the previous check, it should not be None in the current check.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic by removing the `elif make_current` block and modifying the `if make_current is None` block to directly raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop instance is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
