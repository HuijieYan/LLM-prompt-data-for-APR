The problem with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if an IOLoop already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, it should be checking if there is no current IOLoop and raise an error if that is the case.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to change the conditional check inside the `initialize` function so that it raises a `RuntimeError` only if there is no current IOLoop. Additionally, the `self.make_current()` call should be removed, as it is not necessary in this case.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
