The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance depending on the value of the `make_current` parameter. However, the current implementation is not correctly checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance, leading to potential errors and mismatches between the code logic and the GitHub issue.

The potential error location is in the conditional statements that check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and whether to make the current `IOLoop` based on the `make_current` parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks for the existing current `IOLoop` instance are incomplete and do not account for all possible scenarios. This leads to incorrect handling of whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance and results in the raised `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks should be revised to properly handle the scenarios where the current `IOLoop` instance exists or does not exist based on the value of the `make_current` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the current instance of `IOLoop` is obtained before the conditional checks, and the checks are updated to accurately handle the cases where the current instance exists or does not exist. This ensures that the `make_current` behavior aligns with the intended logic and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
