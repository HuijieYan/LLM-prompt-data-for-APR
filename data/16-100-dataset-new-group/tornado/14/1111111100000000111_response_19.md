The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The issue is related to the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` or not, and the error message "current IOLoop already exists" is raised even when the current instance is `None`.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function has a conditional check for the `make_current` parameter, and if it is not provided, it attempts to make the `IOLoop` instance the current one. However, the condition to check if the current instance is `None` or not is not correctly handling the case where the current instance is `None`.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for the current instance in the `initialize` function needs to be modified to handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the current instance is assigned to `current_instance` variable and then the conditional checks are modified accordingly to handle the `None` case correctly. If `make_current` is not provided and the current instance is `None`, it will make the `IOLoop` instance the current one. If `make_current=True` and the current instance is not `None`, it will raise an error.
