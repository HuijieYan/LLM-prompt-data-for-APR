### Potential Error Locations
1. The `if make_current is None` block
2. The `elif make_current` block

### Cause of the Bug
The problem seems to arise from the logic inside the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, the code checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None, and if it is not None, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This logic is contradicting as it should only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None, not the other way around.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `initialize` function should be modified to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not None.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # changed to not None
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the comparison `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is changed to `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `elif make_current` block to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when the current `IOLoop` instance is not None.
