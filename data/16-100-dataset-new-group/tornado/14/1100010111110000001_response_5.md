The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is designed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance. The function checks if a current IOLoop exists and if not, tries to create one. However, the bug occurs when the function is called with `make_current=True`, as it raises a `RuntimeError` when it expects it to be None.

The failing test is `test_force_current` from `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` and it asserts that calling `IOLoop(make_current=True)` should raise a `RuntimeError` as the current IOLoop already exists, but the test fails due to the bug in the `initialize` function.

The error message indicates that when the `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True`, it raises a `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` when it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly. If `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current IOLoop, it should make the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and pass the failing test.
