## Correction

The issue is with the logic in the `initialize` function. It checks whether the current IOLoop instance exists and whether to make a new one. The problem is that it does not handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

I suggest updating the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists. It should raise an error in this case.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will properly handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists, raising a `RuntimeError` as expected.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
