The problem with the current implementation of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is that it does not handle the case where `make_current=True` and an instance of the current `IOLoop` already exists. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected implementation, the `initialize` function will first check if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists and then handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test case `test_force_current` passes without raising a `RuntimeError`.
