The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and then either create a new one or raise an error. However, the current implementation is not handling the case when `make_current` is `True` correctly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

The issue lies in the conditional statement `if make_current:`. The code does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists, and the failing test should pass.
