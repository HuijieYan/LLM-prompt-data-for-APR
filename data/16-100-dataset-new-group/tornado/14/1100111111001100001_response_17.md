The bug in the `initialize` function is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. It is supposed to check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to create a new one, but it doesn't do so effectively.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and prevent the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance if one already exists.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
