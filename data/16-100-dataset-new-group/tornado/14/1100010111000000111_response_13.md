## Analysis 
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop object. The problem seems to be with the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if not, then to initialize a new one. There is also an issue with the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

## Error Location
The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The `initialize` function is not handling the case where a current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is True. This leads to the wrong RuntimeError being raised and prevents the correct behavior described in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
Fix the conditional statements to properly handle the case where a current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is True. Also, revise the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter in order to address the issue described in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
