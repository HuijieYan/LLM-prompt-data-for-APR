#### Bug in the buggy function
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The function has a problem with handling the `make_current` parameter. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance.

### Cause of the bug
The `initialize` function is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance, but it fails to do so when `make_current` is `True`. This leads to the incorrect handling of the current `IOLoop` instance and can result in a RuntimeError being incorrectly raised.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and set the current `IOLoop` instance based on its value.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the `initialize` function addresses the bug by checking if `IOLoop` is already the current instance before trying to make it the current instance again when `make_current` is `True`. It prevents unnecessary attempts to set the current `IOLoop` instance and correctly raises a RuntimeError if the current instance already exists.
