The bug in the initialize function is that it is using IOLoop.current(instance=False) to check if an IOLoop already exists, but it should be using self.current(instance=False) to check this. Additionally, the logic for checking if an IOLoop already exists needs to be in the first part of the if statement.

To fix the bug, we need to replace IOLoop.current(instance=False) with self.current(instance=False) and adjust the logic of the if statement.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With these changes, the function should pass the failing test.
