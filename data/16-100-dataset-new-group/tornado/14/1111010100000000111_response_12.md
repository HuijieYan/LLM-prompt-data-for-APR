### Analysis
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance, including making it the current instance if necessary. The issue on GitHub suggests that there is a problem with the logic in the `initialize` function that causes it to improperly raise an error even when the current IOLoop does not exist.

### Error Location
The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and the check for the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the logic of the conditional statements in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `None`, the first conditional statement checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then calls `self.make_current()`. However, the logic for when `make_current` is `True` seems to be incorrect, causing the function to raise an error even when the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the conditional logic for when `make_current` is `True` needs to be revised to properly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist. Additionally, the logic for when `make_current` is `None` should also be reviewed to ensure it behaves as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
