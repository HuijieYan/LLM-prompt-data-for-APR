The buggy function `initialize` is throwing a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This is because when `make_current` is True, it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if it does, it raises the `RuntimeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is opposite of what is expected. When `make_current` is True, the code is checking if an instance does not exist, and if it does, raises an error. It should instead check if an IOLoop instance already exists and only proceed further if it does not exist.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditions in the `initialize` function to:
- Check if `make_current` is True and an instance of IOLoop already exists, then raise an error.
- Check if `make_current` is True and no instance of IOLoop exists, then the function should make the current IOLoop.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version swaps the logic within the `initialize` function to properly check for the existence of an IOLoop instance when `make_current` is True, and acts according to the check's result.
