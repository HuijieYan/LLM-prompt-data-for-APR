The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. It should be checking if an IOLoop is already the current instance before trying to make it the current instance, but the current code is not correctly handling this case.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to properly check if an IOLoop is already the current instance before trying to make it the current instance when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test case should now pass.
