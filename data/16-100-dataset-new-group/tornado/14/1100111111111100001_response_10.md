The buggy function is the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The function is intended to initialize the IOLoop and optionally set it as the current IOLoop. However, the bug causes an error when trying to initialize a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` if a current IOLoop already exists.

The main issue in the buggy function is that it does not handle the case when a current IOLoop already exists and `make_current=True`. This results in a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if a current IOLoop exists, and if it does, either raise an error or handle the situation appropriately before making the new IOLoop the current one.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions...

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, when `make_current=True`, the function first checks if a current IOLoop already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If no current IOLoop exists, it then proceeds to make the new IOLoop the current one.

With this correction, the failing test should pass and no `RuntimeError` should be raised when attempting to initialize a new IOLoop with `make_current=True`.
