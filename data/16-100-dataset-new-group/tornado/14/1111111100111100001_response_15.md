The bug in the `initialize` function exists in the conditional statements. The function first checks if `make_current` is `None` and then tries to initialize the current `IOLoop` if it does not exist. However, when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, the function incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` exists, and if it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` exists is incorrectly handled when `make_current` is set to `True`.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement for handling `make_current` should be modified to always attempt to make the current `IOLoop`. If there is already a current `IOLoop`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` only when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With the corrected function, it will always try to make the current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and it will raise a `RuntimeError` only if a current `IOLoop` already exists and `make_current` is `True`.
