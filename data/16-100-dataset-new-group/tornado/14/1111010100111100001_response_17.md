The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not checking if there is already an existing current `IOLoop` before attempting to make a new one current when `make_current=True`.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
With this corrected version, the function will first check if `make_current` is `True` and if there is already an existing current `IOLoop`. If so, it will raise a `RuntimeError`. Then, it will check if `make_current` is `None` and if there is no current `IOLoop`, in which case it will make the new `IOLoop` current.
