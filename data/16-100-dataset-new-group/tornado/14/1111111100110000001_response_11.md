The bug in the function `initialize` is that it always compares `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to `None` when evaluating the condition to check if a current IOLoop instance exists or not. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised, as it incorrectly determines that a current IOLoop already exists when it doesn't. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to properly check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the `instance=False` argument from the calls to `IOLoop.current()` and used the `is not None` condition for checking the existence of a current IOLoop instance. This should resolve the bug and the function should now pass the failing test.
