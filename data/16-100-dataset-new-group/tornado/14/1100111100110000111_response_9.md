The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the RuntimeError to be raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This is contradictory and causing the test to fail.

The potential error locations are the conditionals in the `initialize` function that check for the existence of the current IOLoop.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checking for the existence of the current IOLoop is not correctly handling the case where it is None.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditionals to correctly handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By storing the value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable and checking that variable in the conditionals, we can ensure that the correct behavior is applied. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
