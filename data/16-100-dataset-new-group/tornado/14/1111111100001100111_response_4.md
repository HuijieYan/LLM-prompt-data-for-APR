The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly checks for a current instance of `IOLoop` when `make_current` is set to `False`. This causes the function to raise a RuntimeError despite there not being a current instance of `IOLoop`.

The bug occurs because the `initialize` function erroneously checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. This logic is incorrect because when `make_current=False`, it should not be checking for the current instance at all.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `if make_current` condition is adjusted to `if make_current is True` to accurately check for the `True` value. This change ensures that the function correctly checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` only when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.
