The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class and is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance. The potential error locations within the function are the conditional statements that check the value of the `make_current` parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not handling the case where `make_current` is `False` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This would result in the new `IOLoop` instance not being made current as intended.

To fix the bug, we will modify the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is `False` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if existing_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            # If make_current is False and a current instance exists, do not make the new IOLoop instance current
            pass
    elif make_current:
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if existing_instance is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional block to handle the case where `make_current` is `False` and a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If this is the case, the new `IOLoop` instance will not be made current, which aligns with the intended behavior.
