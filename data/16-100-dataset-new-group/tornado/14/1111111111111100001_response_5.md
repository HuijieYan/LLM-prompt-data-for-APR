The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the failing test because the function is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument.

The buggy code is misbehaving when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. It should check if an instance of the `IOLoop` class already exists and only then try to make the current loop. If an instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and perform the necessary checks and actions.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will check the value of `make_current` and act accordingly, ensuring that the `IOLoop` instance is handled correctly.

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test.
