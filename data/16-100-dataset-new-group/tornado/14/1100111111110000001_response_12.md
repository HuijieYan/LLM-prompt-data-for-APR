The issue with the `initialize` function is that it is not properly handling the logic to check whether an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance. As a result, the `RuntimeError` is being raised incorrectly in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`.

To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to properly validate the logic for making the current IOLoop instance. Here's the corrected version:

```python
# The source code of the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, we ensure that the current IOLoop instance is properly checked for existence before attempting to set it as the current instance. This should resolve the `RuntimeError` issue with the failing test.
