## Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` function is causing it to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is True, even when the current IOLoop already exists. This is conflicting with the condition check and causing the failing test.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error is in the conditional check for `make_current` and the subsequent logic to raise a `RuntimeError`. 

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is the incorrect logic in the conditional check for `make_current`. When `make_current` is True, it should only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists. However, the buggy function is raising a `RuntimeError` even when the current IOLoop does not exist.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the conditional check for `make_current`. The `RuntimeError` should only be raised if the current IOLoop already exists and `make_current` is True.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By using `current_instance` to store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and modifying the conditional check, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
