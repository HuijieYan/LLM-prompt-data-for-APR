### Fixed Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# this is the fixed function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking if the current IOLoop exists is incorrect. The original code would attempt to create the IOLoop if it did not exist, and would also attempt to create it again if `make_current` was specified as `True`, resulting in the `RuntimeError` being raised even if the IOLoop did not exist.

The fixed version of the function first checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if it is, it checks if the IOLoop exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. If `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if the IOLoop exists and again raises a `RuntimeError` if it does.

This logic ensures that the IOLoop is only created if it does not exist and that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if the IOLoop already exists when attempting to make it current.
