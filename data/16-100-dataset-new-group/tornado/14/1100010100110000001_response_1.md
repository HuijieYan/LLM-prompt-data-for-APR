Based on the error message, the bug is causing the RuntimeError: "current IOLoop already exists" to be raised when the make_current parameter is set to True. This means that the IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not evaluating as None when it should. 

The bug is likely within the IOLoop.current(instance=False) method, which is not returning None as expected.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to modify the initialize function to properly check whether the current IOLoop instance exists, and only make it the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Removed the redundant check for 'elif make_current'
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

By incorporating the check for IOLoop.current(instance=False) inside the second condition, the function should now work as expected and pass the failing test.
