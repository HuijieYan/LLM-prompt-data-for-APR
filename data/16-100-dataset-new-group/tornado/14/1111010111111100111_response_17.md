The issue with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is that it does not handle the `make_current` parameter correctly. The function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and only raise an error if `make_current` is set to `True` and a current instance exists.

The corrected version of the `initialize` function should first check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. If both conditions are met, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it should proceed to make the current instance if needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class members)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if current_instance is not None and make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")

        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue. Now, when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it will raise a `RuntimeError` as expected.
