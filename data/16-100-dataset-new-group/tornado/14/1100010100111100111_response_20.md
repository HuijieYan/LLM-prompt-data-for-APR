Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is occurring when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, which contradicts the check within the function. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None. We can also consider refactoring the conditional statements for clarity.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the variable `current_instance` and then use this variable for the conditional checks. This ensures that we are properly handling the case for `make_current=True` and the current instance already exists.

This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the failing test pass.
