## The corrected version of the function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The cause of the bug is that the logic in the original function does not check the condition properly to determine whether the current IOLoop already exists. This results in the RuntimeError being raised when it should not be.

By modifying the condition and the order of statements within the `initialize` function, we can properly check if the current IOLoop exists and then either raise the RuntimeError or make the current IOLoop based on the condition.

The corrected version of the function should properly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that the correct action is taken based on the existence of the current IOLoop.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
