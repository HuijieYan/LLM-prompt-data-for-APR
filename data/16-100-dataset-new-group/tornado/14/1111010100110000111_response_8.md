The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and the check for the current `IOLoop` instance.

The cause of the bug is that the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`, indicating that there is no current `IOLoop` instance. However, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when it should not.

To fix the bug, we should first check if `make_current` is `True` and if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If both conditions are met, then the `IOLoop` instance should be set as the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this corrected version, the function checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True`, it sets the current instance only if one does not already exist. If `make_current` is `False`, it raises a `RuntimeError` only if there is already a current instance. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the function behave as intended.
