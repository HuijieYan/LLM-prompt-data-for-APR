The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the condition checks for the `make_current` parameter and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. 

The cause of the bug is that in the `initialize` function, when `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, it should set the current `IOLoop`, but instead, it raises a `RuntimeError` saying "current IOLoop already exists". This is contradictory and causes the test to fail. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition when `make_current` is `True` to ensure that the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` before setting the current `IOLoop`. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and set it accordingly, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
