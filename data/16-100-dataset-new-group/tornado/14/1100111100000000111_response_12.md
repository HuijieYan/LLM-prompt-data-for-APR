### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is checking if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to see if the current IOLoop instance exists. If not, it calls `self.make_current()` to set the current IOLoop. However, the issue on GitHub points out that the logic may be incorrect.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` may not be properly evaluating the existence of the current IOLoop.
2. The logic for checking if the current IOLoop already exists may be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect evaluation of whether the current IOLoop instance exists. The function is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is None and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic properly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and handles the case when `make_current` is None.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):` is used to properly check if the current IOLoop instance does not exist. Additionally, the condition for raising RuntimeError has been adjusted to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False):` to address the issue reported on GitHub.
