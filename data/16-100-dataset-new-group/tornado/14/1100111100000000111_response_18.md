## Correction

### Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop. It checks for the current instance of IOLoop and sets it as the current instance if it doesn't exist. However, there is a bug in the logic where it checks if the current instance is None. This is inconsistent with the subsequent logic that raises a RuntimeError if the current instance already exists.

### Identified potential error locations:
The potential error locations are within the conditional statements where it checks if the current instance is None and then proceeds to handle the logic based on this check.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug causes inconsistency in the logic of the `initialize` function. If `make_current` is None, it checks if the current instance is None and sets it as the current instance. But if `make_current` is True, it also checks if the current instance is None, and if it's not, it raises a RuntimeError. This is inconsistent and leads to the bug.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the cases of `make_current` and the current instance in a consistent manner. Additionally, we should also ensure that the `make_current` function is called with the appropriate parameters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we have modified the conditional statements to check for the conditions in a consistent manner and also made sure that the `make_current` function is called with the appropriate parameters. This should address the inconsistency and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
