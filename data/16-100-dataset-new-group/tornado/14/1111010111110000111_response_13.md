The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class on line 253. The conditional statement `if make_current is None:` triggers a call to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, which should return `None` when no current `IOLoop` instance exists. However, if `make_current` is `True`, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

The bug seems to be caused by the conditional logic in the `initialize` method not correctly handling the condition when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, a better strategy would be to modify the conditional logic to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This can be done by removing the first `if make_current is None:` check and keeping the `elif make_current:` check. Additionally, the logic inside this conditional block should correctly handle the case when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method should now handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, as well as the case when `make_current` is `None`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
