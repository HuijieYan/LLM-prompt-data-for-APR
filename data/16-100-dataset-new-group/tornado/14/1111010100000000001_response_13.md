Potential error locations within the `initialize` function:
1. The `make_current` method is called without being defined within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The `IOLoop.current` method is called with `instance=False` argument, which may not be a valid argument for the method.

Cause of the bug:
The `make_current` and `IOLoop.current` methods are being used incorrectly within the `initialize` function. Additionally, the usage of the `instance` argument with the `IOLoop.current` method is causing confusion and possibly incorrect behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `make_current` method within the `IOLoop` class.
2. Check the documentation or code for the `IOLoop.current` method to understand the correct usage of the method and its arguments.
3. Review the intended behavior of the `initialize` function and make necessary updates to achieve the desired behavior.

Corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current():
                raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we assume that the `make_current` method is defined within the `IOLoop` class. We remove the unnecessary check for `make_current` being `None` and simplify the logic to only check if `make_current` is `True`. We also remove the `instance` argument from the `IOLoop.current` method as it's unnecessary and potentially incorrect.
