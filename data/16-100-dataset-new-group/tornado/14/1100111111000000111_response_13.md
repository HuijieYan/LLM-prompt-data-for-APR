The issue is with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class inside the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The problem arises when the `make_current` argument is `True`. The logic in the `initialize` function is intended to check if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if not, creates a new one. However, the logic is flawed and does not handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` when `make_current` is `True`.

The logic should be corrected to handle this case properly and raise an error if a new IOLoop instance is being created when one already exists. Additionally, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument needs to be revised to ensure that it functions as expected.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be updated as follows:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the `initialize` function will handle the `make_current` argument correctly and avoid creating a new IOLoop instance if one already exists. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `test_force_current` function passes successfully.
