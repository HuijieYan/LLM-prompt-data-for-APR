The issue with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is that it doesn't correctly handle the `make_current` argument. The current logic is flawed and doesn't account for the case where `make_current` is set to `True`.

The bug is due to the incorrect conditional checks and improper handling of the `make_current` argument.

To fix the bug, the logic of the `initialize` function needs to be updated to properly handle the `make_current` argument. Additionally, the usage of the `make_current` function should be corrected to ensure that the current IOLoop instance is set correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With these changes, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument is corrected. The function will now correctly determine whether to make the IOLoop instance the current one based on the value of `make_current`.

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test provided.
