The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class does not correctly handle the `make_current` argument. When `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` method, it should set the IOLoop as the current instance and raise an error if there is already a current instance. However, the current implementation is checking `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` which causes the incorrect behavior of raising an error every time a new IOLoop is initialized.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` argument. When `make_current=True`, we should simply make this IOLoop the current instance without checking the existence of the current instance again.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected implementation, the `initialize` method should now correctly handle the `make_current` argument and pass the failing test.
