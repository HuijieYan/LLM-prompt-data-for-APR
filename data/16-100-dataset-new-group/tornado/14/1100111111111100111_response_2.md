## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the issue described in the GitHub post should be resolved. This fixed version of the `initialize` function properly handles the cases where `make_current` is `None` and when it's `True`, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the desired logic based on the failing test case provided.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
