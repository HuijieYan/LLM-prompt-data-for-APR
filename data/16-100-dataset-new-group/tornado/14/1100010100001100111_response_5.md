Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` which may not be evaluating as expected.
2. The condition `if make_current` which may not be evaluating as expected.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect evaluation of the conditions `if make_current is None` and `if make_current`, leading to unexpected behavior of the function.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition `if make_current is None` to check if `make_current` is `True` or `False`.
2. Update the condition `if make_current` to avoid potential false positives.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
