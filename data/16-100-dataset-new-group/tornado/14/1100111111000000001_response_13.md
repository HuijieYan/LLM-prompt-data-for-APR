## Analysis:
The bug seems to be within the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` function is supposed to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, create one. However, the logic is incorrect and not behaving as expected.

### Error Location:
The error is likely to be in the `initialize` function, specifically in the conditional checks and the way the `make_current` parameter is being used.

## Bug Cause:
The `initialize` function does not correctly handle the logic of creating a new `IOLoop` instance. It fails to check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and always tries to create a new one, causing the test to fail.

## Strategy to Fix the Bug:
The `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance. It should only create a new instance if one does not already exist, and it should also handle the case where `make_current` is `True` appropriately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")

    # Other class methods...
```

In the corrected version, the logic for `make_current` is correctly handled, and the conditional checks ensure that a new `IOLoop` is only created when needed. This should address the bug and make the `test_force_current` function pass.
