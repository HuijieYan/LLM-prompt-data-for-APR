The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` class. It takes an optional argument `make_current`, and based on its value, it calls the `make_current` method of the class.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The comparison `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is unexpected as it is calling the class method directly and comparing it to `None`.
2. The use of `self.make_current()` without checking if `make_current` is `None` before calling it.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly used to check if the class should be initialized, and the `make_current` method may be called even if it is not needed.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic of the function to properly handle the `make_current` argument and avoid direct calls to class methods.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
1. We replaced `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` with `if not IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, which checks if the current IOLoop instance does not exist.
2. We added a check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False):` before trying to make the current IOLoop instance, in order to avoid unnecessary calls.
