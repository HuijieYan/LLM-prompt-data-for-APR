The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current loop if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the bug occurs when the function does not correctly handle the case where there is already a current IOLoop present.

The failing test `test_force_current` verifies that a second call to `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` because the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly check if a current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make the loop current.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case of an existing current IOLoop and pass the failing test.
