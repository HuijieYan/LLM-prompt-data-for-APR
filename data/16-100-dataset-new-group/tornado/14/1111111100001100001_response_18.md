### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` class, making it the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing current `IOLoop`. It should also make the `IOLoop` current if `make_current` is not provided and there is no existing current `IOLoop`.

The bug seems to be related to the logic around checking and setting the current `IOLoop`.

### Bug
The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing current `IOLoop`. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Fix
The bug can be fixed by changing the logic to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is an existing current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing current `IOLoop`, the function should proceed to make the `IOLoop` current.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
