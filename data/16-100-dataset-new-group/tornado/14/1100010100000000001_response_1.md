## Analysis of the buggy function:
The `initialize` function is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists and create it if not. However, there are potential issues with the conditional logic and the `make_current` method.

Potential error locations:
1. Conditional logic for checking `make_current` and `IOLoop.current` instances.
2. The `make_current` method may not be called correctly.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when the `make_current` method is not being called properly based on the conditional checks, leading to incorrect initialization of the IOLoop instance.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the conditional logic to ensure that the `make_current` method is called when necessary.
2. Ensure that the `make_current` method is called with the appropriate parameters.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
