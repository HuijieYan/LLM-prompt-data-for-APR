The bug in the `initialize` function causes the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` to be raised when `IOLoop(make_current=True)` is called the second time in the test function. This error occurs because the `initialize` function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises an error if it does.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function to handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We can modify the `initialize` function to only set the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True` and no current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other functions in the class remain the same

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test.
