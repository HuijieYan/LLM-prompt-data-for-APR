## Analysis of the buggy function:
The initialize function is designed to set the current IOLoop instance. It takes an optional parameter make_current, which is used to determine whether to make the current IOLoop instance or not.

## Potential error locations:
1. The conditional logic seems to be incorrect in the function.
2. The make_current() method is called but not defined within the function.
3. The RuntimeError is raised without checking the condition properly.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the function is in the conditional logic. It does not handle the make_current parameter properly, and the make_current method is not defined. Also, the RuntimeError is raised without checking the condition properly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the make_current parameter properly and handle the conditions accordingly.
2. Define the make_current method if necessary.
3. Properly handle the RuntimeError condition after checking the necessary conditions.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current() # assuming make_current is a defined method
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current() # assuming make_current is a defined method
```
