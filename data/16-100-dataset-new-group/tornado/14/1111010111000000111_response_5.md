## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are:
1. Incorrect condition checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop`.
2. Incorrect usage of the `make_current` parameter.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the condition checking in the `initialize` function is incorrect. It is not properly handling the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` as it is not raising the error message "current IOLoop already exists" when it should. This is causing the failing test `test_force_current` to fail because the assertion for `RuntimeError` is not being triggered.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the condition checking in the `initialize` function needs to be revised to correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. Additionally, the `make_current` parameter should be used appropriately to ensure that the current `IOLoop` is correctly initialized.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function with the corrected version, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass. This fix properly handles the conditions for the existence of the current `IOLoop` and the `make_current` parameter.
