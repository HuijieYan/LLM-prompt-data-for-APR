The issue with the `initialize` function is that it does not handle the case when `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance. This causes the test to fail because the RuntimeError is not being raised in that scenario.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance. It should pass the failing test provided.
