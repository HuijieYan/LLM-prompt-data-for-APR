The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the failing test `test_force_current` in the `ioloop_test.py` file.

The bug appears to occur when the `initialize` function is called with the parameter `make_current=True`. The function is intended to check if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if not, to create one. However, the current implementation of the function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the failing test.

The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `None` and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If both conditions are met, it calls `self.make_current()`. Otherwise, it checks if `make_current` is `True` and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and then it raises a `RuntimeError`.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Changed elif to else to handle both None and True cases
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists, addressing the bug and ensuring that the failing test `test_force_current` passes.

This correction should resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the line 252 in `ioloop.py`, where the behavior was inconsistent with the expected logic.
