The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file has a bug where it incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop already exists, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised, as seen in the failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the function attempts to check if the current IOLoop already exists. If it does not exist, the function should create a new IOLoop instance. If it does exist, it should not create a new instance and raise a `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and check if the current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, it should not create a new instance and raise the `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and not raise a `RuntimeError` when the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
