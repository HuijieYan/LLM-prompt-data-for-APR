The issue with the initialize function is that it is not properly handling the make_current parameter. When make_current is True, the function should check if the current IOLoop instance already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. However, the function is not handling this case correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code so that it properly handles the make_current parameter and checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly check if the current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to create a new one, and will raise a RuntimeError if it does.
