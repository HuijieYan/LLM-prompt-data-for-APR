## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The bug in the original function is that if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it should not raise an error because the current IOLoop does not already exist. The bug causes the test `test_force_current` to fail because it raises a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't.

The bug can be fixed by changing the `if` condition in the `elif` block to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None. This will ensure that the error is only raised when the current IOLoop already exists.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
