A potential error location in the `initialize` function is the condition `if make_current is None`. There is an issue with how the `make_current` parameter is being used to determine whether to call `self.make_current()` or to raise a `RuntimeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current is None` is not sufficient to check if the current IOLoop already exists. The `make_current` parameter is not being used correctly to check for the existence of the current IOLoop.

To fix the bug, we can update the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check for the existence of the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_ioloop is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `make_current` parameter is used to determine whether to make the current IOLoop or check for its existence appropriately.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
