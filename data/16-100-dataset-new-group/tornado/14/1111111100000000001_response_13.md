The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The purpose of this function is to initialize the IOLoop instance.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional logic used to check `make_current` and the calls to `IOLoop.current` and `self.make_current()`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic for `make_current` is not correctly handling all cases. There is a check for `make_current` being `None`, but the subsequent logic is not properly executed. Additionally, the calls to `IOLoop.current` and `self.make_current()` may not be functioning as intended.

To fix the bug, we can update the conditional logic to handle the case when `make_current` is `None` and when it is `True`. We also need to ensure that the calls to `IOLoop.current` and `self.make_current()` are functioning as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we removed the unnecessary check for `make_current` being `None` or worked on the situations where `IOLoop.current()` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` are both None. We also adjusted the condition for `make_current` being `True` to properly check if the current IOLoop already exists and appropriately raise an error or make it current.
