The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize an instance of the class and make it the current `IOLoop` if required. However, the current implementation is not handling the case where `make_current=True` properly, leading to a RuntimeError being raised when it shouldn't.

### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` inside the `initialize` function doesn't seem to handle the case of `make_current=True` correctly.
2. The `if` statement that raises a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function incorrectly handles the case where `make_current=True`. The condition to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None doesn't seem to correctly handle the initialization process.

The failing test is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, and then it is checking if the current `IOLoop` is the one that was created. This should pass without any error, but the current implementation is raising a RuntimeError.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and adjust the logic to avoid raising a RuntimeError if the current `IOLoop` is None. The initialization logic should also be reviewed to ensure it sets the current `IOLoop` as expected.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code here)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is True and current_instance is not None:
            return  # if already current, do nothing
        elif make_current and current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is False and current_instance is not None:
            current_instance.clear_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument has been adjusted to properly determine if the current `IOLoop` instance is already set, and to avoid raising a RuntimeError. This correction should address the issue reported and allow the failing test to pass.
