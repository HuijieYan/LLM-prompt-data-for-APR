### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, but it has a logical error in the condition checks. It incorrectly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop and the value of `make_current` to determine if the IOLoop needs to be made current. This logic is flawed and leads to the function not functioning as intended.

### Bug Fix
The logic needs to be revised to properly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`. Additionally, the function should be redesigned to ensure that the current IOLoop is set correctly based on the input conditions.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
