### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` is failing the test because it does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` correctly. The function is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and then either make it the current instance or raise a `RuntimeError` if it already exists. However, the current implementation is not working as expected.

The error message specifically indicates that the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is being raised, which is not the intended behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic inside the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and correctly check if an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and address the issue that caused the failing test.
