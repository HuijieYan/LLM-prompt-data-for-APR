The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly when `make_current` is set to `True`. This is leading to the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.

The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`. It attempts to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, but the condition is incorrect, which leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted so that it correctly handles the case where `make_current` is `True`. Specifically, the condition for checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists needs to be updated to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and avoid raising the `RuntimeError` erroneously. This should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
