The bug in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is related to the way the `make_current` argument is handled. The bug is causing the `test_force_current` test to fail.

The potential error locations within the `initialize` method are:
1. Incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument.
2. Improper use of the `IOLoop.current` method.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method is not handling the `make_current` argument as intended, which leads to the incorrect behavior when creating a new `IOLoop` instance with the `make_current=True` argument.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be modified to properly handle the `make_current` argument. It should only attempt to make the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, and it should raise an error if there is already a current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will correctly handle the `make_current` argument and address the issue reported on GitHub. The corrected version of the `initialize` method should resolve the failing test and the GitHub issue.
