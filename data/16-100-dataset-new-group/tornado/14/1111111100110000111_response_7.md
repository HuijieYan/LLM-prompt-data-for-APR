## The buggy function analysis

The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class appears to be checking if an IOLoop instance already exists and then either setting it as the current instance, or raising a `RuntimeError` if it already exists. 

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are:
1. Checking the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`
2. Handling the `make_current` argument and setting the current instance


## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the logic to check the current IOLoop instance and handling the `make_current` argument is not consistent with the behavior mentioned in the class documentation. The error message "current IOLoop already exists" is triggered even when the current IOLoop instance is `None`, which contradicts the logic in the function's code.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance and handling the `make_current` argument needs to be revised. Additionally, the handling of the `make_current` argument should be aligned with the expected behavior described in the class documentation.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `True` and if the current IOLoop instance is not `None`. If both conditions are true, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is `True` but the current instance is `None`, then it sets the current instance using `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `False`, it does not attempt to become the current IOLoop.
