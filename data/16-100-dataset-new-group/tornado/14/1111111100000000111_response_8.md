Analysis:
The buggy function in the initialize method of the IOLoop class checks if the IOLoop.current instance is None and then attempts to make the current IOLoop instance. However, the logic seems flawed as it checks for None and then raises an error if it's not None, which is contradictory.

Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic within the initialize method, specifically the conditional statements.
2. The make_current method may not be functioning as expected.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect logic within the initialize method. It checks if IOLoop.current is None, but then raises an error if it's not None, which is contradictory.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the logic within the initialize method to ensure that the error is only raised if IOLoop.current is indeed not None when make_current is set to True.
2. Verify the functionality of the make_current method to ensure it sets the current IOLoop instance correctly.

Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
