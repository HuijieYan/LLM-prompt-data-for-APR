The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module. The test that is failing is `test_force_current` from `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`. The error message clearly indicates that "current IOLoop already exists". This is because the `make_current` argument is not correctly handled in the `initialize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checked twice, leading to the premature setting of the current `IOLoop` instance. This prevents the second check from raising the `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to refactor the conditional statements in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` argument. Then, we should instantiate a new `IOLoop` object and call its `initialize` method to set the current `IOLoop`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should handle the `make_current` argument properly and pass the failing test.
