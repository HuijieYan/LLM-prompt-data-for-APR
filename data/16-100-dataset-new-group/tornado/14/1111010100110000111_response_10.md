The issue in the `IOLoop` class `initialize` method is that it checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance incorrectly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly. The code checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None, but in the case where the `make_current` argument is True and there is already an instance of `IOLoop`, it incorrectly raises the RuntimeError. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the conditional statement to check if `make_current` is True and there is already an instance of `IOLoop`, then no action should be taken.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if make_current is True and there is already an instance
        pass  # Do nothing
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Invalid value for make_current argument")
```

In this corrected version, we added an additional condition to check if `make_current` is True and there is already an instance of `IOLoop`, then nothing should be done. This ensures that the RuntimeError is only raised when necessary.

By making this change, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
