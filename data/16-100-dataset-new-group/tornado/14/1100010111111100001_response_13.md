The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize an IOLoop instance and ensure that it is set as the current IOLoop. However, the error message from the failing test indicates that the current IOLoop already exists. The relevant code in the failing test is attempting to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` after the initial IOLoop has already been set as the current one, which is expected to raise a `RuntimeError`.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the `if make_current` condition, specifically the check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition is meant to determine if the current IOLoop already exists, but it is not handling the case where the current IOLoop already exists correctly.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter when a current IOLoop already exists. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not sufficient to check if the current IOLoop already exists, as it only checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance without considering the `make_current` parameter.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop should be revised to consider the `make_current` parameter and whether the IOLoop is already set as current. Additionally, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter should be adjusted to ensure that a new IOLoop is only set as the current one if it doesn't already exist.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
