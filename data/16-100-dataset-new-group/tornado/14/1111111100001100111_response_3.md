The issue in the code arises from the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` function takes in a parameter `make_current`, which is used to determine whether the current `IOLoop` instance should be made the current instance. However, the logic inside the function is causing unexpected behavior as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`. In this case, the function first checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. If this condition is true, it should raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". However, the condition is inverted, causing the error to be raised when the current `IOLoop` does not exist.

To fix the bug, the condition at line 9 should be modified to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None before raising the `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the function should behave as expected, and the error described in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
