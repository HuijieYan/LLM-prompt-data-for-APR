The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing a RuntimeError to be raised when `make_current` is True. The issue seems to be related to the condition checks for `make_current` and the call to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

The `current` method should be called with the `instance` parameter set to `False` to check if an IOLoop instance already exists. However, in the current implementation, the `current` method is being called as `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` which is incorrect.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the condition check for `make_current` to handle the case when `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current()` is not None.
2. Call the `current` method with the correct parameter setup to check for the existence of an IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
