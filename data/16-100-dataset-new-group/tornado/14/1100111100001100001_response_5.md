The buggy function `initialize` is checking if the `make_current` parameter is None and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, then it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError or calls `self.make_current()`.

The potential error location is in the condition `if make_current is None`. It should be `if make_current is not None`. 

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current is None` will always be False and the code inside that block will never be executed, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the condition `if make_current is None` should be changed to `if make_current is not None`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
