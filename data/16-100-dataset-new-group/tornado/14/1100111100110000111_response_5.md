### Fixing the bug

The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the code checks if the current IOLoop is None and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists. However, there is a discrepancy in the logic as it should only raise the error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None.

Additionally, the `current` method within the `IOLoop` class is missing the `self` parameter and should have it as it's a class method. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the `initialize` method to correctly check if the current IOLoop already exists.

### The corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(self, instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(self, instance=False) is None:  # Fixed line
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(self, instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed line
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version, the condition for checking the current IOLoop's existence has been fixed in the `initialize` method. It now correctly checks if the current IOLoop instance exists or not before raising the `RuntimeError`. This will address the issue reported on GitHub and resolve the failing test case.
