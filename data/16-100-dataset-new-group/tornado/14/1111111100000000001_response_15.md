The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. It calls the `current` and `make_current` functions from the same class, and also indirectly calls the `current` and `make_current` functions from the same file, but not the same class.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` does not check if the current instance is available, leading to a potential logical error.
2. The `make_current` function is called without any arguments, which could also lead to a potential error.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not appropriately check for the current instance of `IOLoop` and does not handle the `make_current` argument properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function can be revised as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In the revised version:
1. The `make_current` argument is made default to `True`.
2. It appropriately checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` and handles the `make_current` argument based on the conditions provided.

This revised version should resolve the potential bugs in the `initialize` function.
