The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` class by setting the current instance if it doesn't already exist. It takes a parameter `make_current` which defaults to `None`.

The bug in the function lies in the conditional statement for checking `make_current` and the subsequent logic to initialize the current instance.

The bug causes the function to not initialize the current instance correctly, leading to potential runtime errors and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to restructure the conditional statements and the logic for initializing the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not self.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the function properly checks if the current instance exists and initializes it accordingly based on the `make_current` parameter.
