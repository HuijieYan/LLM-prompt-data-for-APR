The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and can optionally make itself the current IOLoop. The bug in the function is that the logic is incorrect for determining whether to make the IOLoop current.

The cause of the bug is that in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, the conditional check for whether the current IOLoop exists is incorrect. It incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True`, even if the IOLoop is not yet current.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function. This can be done by checking the value of `make_current` and then conditionally calling `self.make_current()` if the current IOLoop is not already set.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods and definitions)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self` ensures that the current IOLoop is not already set before attempting to make the current IOLoop. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function operates correctly. After making this change, the test_should_not_err test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
