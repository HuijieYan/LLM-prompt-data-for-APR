Potential error locations: 
1. The condition `make_current is None` might not be evaluating as expected.
2. The condition `make_current` might not be evaluating as expected.

Cause of the bug: 
The buggy function is not checking the condition `make_current is None` correctly, which leads to unexpected behavior when trying to make the current IOLoop.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Update the conditional statements to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that the current IOLoop is correctly initialized.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
