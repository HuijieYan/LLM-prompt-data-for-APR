## Analysis
The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `None`, and the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is also `None`. In this case, the function incorrectly calls `self.make_current()` and sets the current `IOLoop` instance even though it should not.

## Error Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional statements where `make_current` is checked.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `None`, the function assumes that an `IOLoop` instance does not exist, and it calls `self.make_current()`, incorrectly setting the current instance.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the current instance of `IOLoop`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the `current_instance` variable to avoid calling the method multiple times. Then we modify the conditional statements to check the value of `current_instance` and handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly.
