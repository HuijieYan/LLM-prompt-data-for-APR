### Analysis:
The initialize function in the ioloop.py file checks for the current IOLoop instance and raises a RuntimeError if it already exists when make_current=True. The failing test checks if calling IOLoop(make_current=True) twice raises a RuntimeError as expected. The error message points to the line in the initialize function where the RuntimeError is raised.

The GitHub issue indicates confusion about the condition that leads to the RuntimeError being raised.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect condition check for the presence of the current IOLoop instance.
2. Misunderstanding of the behavior of IOLoop.current().

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the initialize function does not correctly handle the case when make_current=True and an IOLoop instance already exists. The condition check for the current IOLoop instance is not being evaluated correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the initialize function to correctly check if an IOLoop instance already exists when make_current=True.
2. Use the IOLoop.current() method to determine if an instance already exists.

### Corrected Version of the initialize function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With the corrected version, the condition for checking the current IOLoop instance is also changed to ensure that it correctly handles the case when make_current=True and an instance already exists.

This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
