The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class, and it takes a parameter `make_current` which decides whether the new `IOLoop` instance should become the current instance.

The potential error in the buggy function is in the conditional checks for `make_current`. The first `if` statement checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it calls `IOLoop.current()` with `instance=False`, but it does not handle the case where `make_current` is `False`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic does not account for the case where `make_current` is `False`, which would prevent the new instance from becoming the current instance.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional logic to handle the case where `make_current` is `False`. We can explicitly check for the value of `make_current` and decide whether to make the new instance the current one based on that value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        # If make_current is explicitly False, do not make the new instance the current one
        pass
```

In the corrected version, we added an `else` condition to handle the case where `make_current` is `False`, and it explicitly does not make the new instance the current one in that case.
