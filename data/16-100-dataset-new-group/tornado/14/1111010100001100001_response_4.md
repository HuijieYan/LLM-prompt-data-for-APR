The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop class, and it takes a parameter `make_current` of type boolean. 

The potential error in the function lies in the condition `if make_current is None`, as it seems to be incorrectly checking if the `makce_current` flag is set to `None`, and if so, it tries to make the IOLoop current.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current is None` does not handle the case where `make_current` is not provided. It only handles the case where `make_current` is explicitly passed as `None`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check if `make_current` is not provided, and then set the default behavior accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we are checking if `make_current` is None using `if make_current is None`, and if so, we are performing the default behavior. If `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, we execute the corresponding block of code, and the rest of the code remains unchanged.
