The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file has a logic issue in the `if` condition for checking the current IOLoop instance. The problem arises when the `make_current` argument is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised even though the condition should have allowed a new IOLoop instance to be created.

The cause of the bug is that the existing logic doesn't account for the scenario where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. This results in the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before deciding whether to create a new instance based on the value of `make_current`. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
