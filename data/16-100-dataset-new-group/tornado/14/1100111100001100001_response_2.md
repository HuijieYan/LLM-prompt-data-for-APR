The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not properly handling the `make_current` parameter. 

The buggy function `initialize` first checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None. If it is, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if it is True and then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None. If it is, it raises a `RuntimeError`, otherwise it calls the `make_current` method.

The problem with this logic is that it is not handling the case where `make_current` is False. Additionally, the logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None is flawed because it calls the class method directly instead of on an instance of the class.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
1. We use `self.current` instead of `IOLoop.current` to call the method on an instance of the class.
2. We added a check to handle the case where `make_current` is False. If `make_current` is False, no action is taken and it just exits the function.
