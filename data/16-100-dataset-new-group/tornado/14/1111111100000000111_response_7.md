The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` class by setting the current IOLoop instance. However, there is a bug where it incorrectly checks whether a current IOLoop instance exists.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is None. If it is, then it proceeds to check if the current IOLoop instance is None. If it is, then it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if it is true and then checks again if the current IOLoop instance is None before calling `self.make_current()`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are incorrectly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The bug arises when `make_current` is not None and the current IOLoop instance is None, leading to a RuntimeError being raised for an already existing IOLoop.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to remove the unnecessary check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is not None. Instead, always call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is True, and only check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is None.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statement for `make_current` being None remains the same, but for the case when `make_current` is not None, it directly checks if `make_current` is true and then proceeds to raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop instance exists.
