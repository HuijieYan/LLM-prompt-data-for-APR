The bug in the `initialize` function is with the logic to handle the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `None`, it should check if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then make the current `IOLoop` instance. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if there is, or make the current `IOLoop` instance if there isn't.

The current logic in the `initialize` function is flawed and does not handle these cases correctly, causing the failing test `test_force_current` to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the different cases of the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)  # Get the current IOLoop instance
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass.
