### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None` and then checks if the current IOLoop exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it does not exist, it calls `self.make_current()`. The issue arises when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` but the function still raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".

### Identified Potential Error Location
The potential error location is at the `if make_current` condition where it should not check if the IOLoop exists again, but simply call `self.make_current()`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the redundant check within the `if make_current` condition. Since it is already determined that the IOLoop exists, there is no need to check it again.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by removing the redundant check for the IOLoop within the `if make_current` condition and simply calling `self.make_current()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
