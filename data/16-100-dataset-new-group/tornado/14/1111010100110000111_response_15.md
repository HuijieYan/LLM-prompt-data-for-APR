The cause of the bug is that when the `initialize` method is called with `make_current=True`, it first checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None before raising a RuntimeError. The issue here is that if it is not None, it should not try to make the current IOLoop. However, the current implementation still attempts to make it the current IOLoop, resulting in the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `initialize` method to directly handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None when `make_current=True`. In this case, we should simply return without raising a RuntimeError.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified condition
            return  # Return without raising an error
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` method now correctly handles the case where `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, preventing the RuntimeError from being raised incorrectly.
