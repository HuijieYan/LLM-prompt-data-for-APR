### Bug Explanation:
The buggy code is checking if the current IOLoop exists and then trying to make it current. However, if `make_current` is set to `True`, the code is incorrectly raising a RuntimeError even if the current IOLoop exists.

The issue on GitHub suggests that there is confusion in the code regarding the check for the existence of the current IOLoop.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) and self is not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("Another IOLoop instance is already current")
        self.make_current()
```

With the corrected logic, the function will first check if the current IOLoop already exists and is different from the one being initialized. If so, it will raise a RuntimeError, otherwise, it will proceed to make the IOLoop current. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
