The cause of the bug:
The issue here is that when calling the `initialize` method with `make_current=True`, the code still checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and then raises a `RuntimeError` even if it is not None.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None when `make_current` is True.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
