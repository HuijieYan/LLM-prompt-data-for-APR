The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` does not handle the case where `make_current` is True.
2. The `self.make_current()` call is missing a check to ensure it is not already the current `IOLoop`.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is True, and it does not check if the current `IOLoop` is already set before calling `self.make_current()`.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `make_current` is True and if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before calling `self.make_current()`.

Here is the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function should now pass the failing test.
