### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance and set it as the current IOLoop. However, the bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. The function raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" despite the condition checking for the existence of the current IOLoop being false.

The failing test case provides the input parameter `make_current` with a value of `True`. The error message, however, indicates that the condition for the existence of the current IOLoop is evaluated as true, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised.

The GitHub issue reflects the confusion about the condition at line 252 and questions why the error is being raised when the condition seems to indicate that the current IOLoop does not exist.

### Bug Location
The potential error location is in the `if make_current:` block, where the condition to check for the existence of the current IOLoop seems to be incorrectly evaluated.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the condition to check whether the current IOLoop exists is not being properly evaluated. This results in the `RuntimeError` being incorrectly raised, causing the failing test and the reported GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the condition that checks for the existence of the current IOLoop when `make_current` is set to `True` needs to be correctly evaluated. Additionally, the logic for handling the creation of the current IOLoop may need to be adjusted.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition inside the `elif make_current:` block has been fixed to check for the existence of the current IOLoop using `IOLoop.current(instance=True)`. This ensures that the correct condition is evaluated before deciding whether to raise a `RuntimeError`. With this fix, the function should no longer raise a `RuntimeError` when the current IOLoop already exists.
