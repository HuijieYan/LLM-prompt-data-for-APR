The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop.py` file. The error message indicates that a RuntimeError is being raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when trying to force the current IOLoop to be made. This suggests that the bug is related to the logic for checking whether a current IOLoop instance exists or not.

The bug is at the `initialize` function when trying to enforce the creation of the current IOLoop instance. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The logic is supposed to check if a current instance exists and then either create a new one or raise an error.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditional check of the `make_current` parameter, particularly when determining whether to raise an error or not.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current == True:  # Modified this line to have a proper conditional check
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified this line to check if current instance exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Modified the error message
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` to raise a RuntimeError. Otherwise, the function will proceed without raising an error.
