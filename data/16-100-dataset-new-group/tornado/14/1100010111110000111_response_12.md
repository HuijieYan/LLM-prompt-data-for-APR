## Fixing the bug

The bug seems to be in the logic of the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be incorrectly raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current is None` is not handled properly. As a result, the code within this condition is not executed as expected, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised only when necessary.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is None or True, and then we check if the current IOLoop already exists. If it does, then we raise the RuntimeError. Otherwise, we call `self.make_current()` to set the current IOLoop.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test pass while resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
