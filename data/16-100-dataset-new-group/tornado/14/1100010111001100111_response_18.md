### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly, which is causing the test function `test_force_current` to fail. The `initialize` function is supposed to check if the current IOLoop exists and if not, make it the current IOLoop. However, the conditionals and logic in the function are incorrect, leading to the test failure.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The conditional check for `make_current` is incorrect.
2. The logic for handling the case when `make_current` is `True` or `None` is flawed.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the IOLoop to be incorrectly detected as already existing, even when it does not. This is leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised inappropriately when the `make_current` parameter is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the different cases when `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and ensure that the current IOLoop is initialized appropriately. The conditional checks need to be adjusted to accurately determine if the current IOLoop exists or not.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current IOLoop instance and then use this variable to perform the conditional checks. This ensures that the correct state of the current IOLoop is determined before making any decisions based on the `make_current` parameter. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
