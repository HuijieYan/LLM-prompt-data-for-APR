The buggy function `initialize` from the `IOLoop` class is failing with the error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`. The `initialize` function takes an optional argument `make_current` and is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance.

The buggy `initialize` function has a logical error in the conditional statements. When `make_current` is None, it should check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and make itself the current instance if one does not exist. When `make_current` is True, it should only make itself the current instance if no current instance already exists. However, the current logic is doing both in both blocks, causing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to change the two if conditions to nested if-else blocks to ensure that the correct behavior is executed based on the value of `make_current`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the conditional logic should now correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and make the current instance based on the value of `make_current`, resolving the RuntimeError.
