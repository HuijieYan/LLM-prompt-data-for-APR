## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function occurs when it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect, as it should be checking for the opposite condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`. This is because if the current IOLoop instance already exists, it should raise a RuntimeError.

Fix:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the condition for the existence check within the function. By changing `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, the bug can be resolved.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
