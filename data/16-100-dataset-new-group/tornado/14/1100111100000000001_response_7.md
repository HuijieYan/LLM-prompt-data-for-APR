The buggy function `initialize` is calling the class method `current` and the instance method `make_current` without specifying the class or instance from which they should be called. This could lead to a potential error when trying to access these methods.

To fix this bug, we need to explicitly specify whether we are calling the class method or the instance method. We can do this by using the `self` parameter for instance methods and the class name for class methods.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we replaced `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` with `self.current(instance=False)` to clearly indicate that we are calling the instance method. Similarly, we replaced `self.make_current()` with `self.make_current()` to explicitly call the instance method for `make_current`.
