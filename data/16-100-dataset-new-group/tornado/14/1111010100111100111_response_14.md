The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing it to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is set to `True`, even though it should only raise this error if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

The bug seems to be in the logic of the `initialize` function, where it checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and then determines whether to make the current instance or raise an error. It appears that the logic for checking the current instance and handling the `make_current` argument is incorrect.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be updated. It should only raise the `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Otherwise, it should make the current instance if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this updated logic, the function will correctly handle the `make_current` argument and only raise an error if there is indeed a current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is `True`. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
