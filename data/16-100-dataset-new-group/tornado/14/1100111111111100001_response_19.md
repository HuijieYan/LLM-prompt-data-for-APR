The problem in the buggy function is that it is not properly checking if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one with make_current=True.

The initialize function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance, and if make_current is True, it should check if an IOLoop instance already exists using the current method. If it does, it should raise a RuntimeError, and if not, it should call the make_current method to set the current IOLoop instance.

The issue with the current implementation is that it is not properly checking for the existence of an IOLoop instance when make_current is True. It should be calling the current method without passing the instance parameter, and the make_current method should be called only if an IOLoop instance does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements in the initialize function to accurately check for the existence of an IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function will properly check for the existence of an IOLoop instance and handle the make_current parameter accordingly. This should resolve the failing test case.
