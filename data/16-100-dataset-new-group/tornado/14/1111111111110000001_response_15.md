The potential error within the buggy function initialize is the incorrect logic for the case when make_current is None, which leads to the RuntimeError being raised when it shouldn't be. The failing test test_force_current is written to create a new IOLoop and asserts that a RuntimeError is raised.

The bug in the initialize function is caused by the incorrect implementation of the logic to handle the make_current parameter, as there is a mix-up in the condition block for make_current=None. The initialize function should call self.make_current() when make_current is set to True, and it should only check for an existing current IOLoop if make_current is set to None.

To fix the bug, the initialize function should be modified to handle the make_current parameter correctly. The corrected version of the initialize function should be as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling the make_current parameter has been simplified to address the bug. The check for an existing current IOLoop is now performed only when make_current is set to True, and self.make_current() is called immediately if make_current is set to None.

This corrected version of the initialize function should resolve the bug and ensure that the failing test test_force_current passes successfully.
