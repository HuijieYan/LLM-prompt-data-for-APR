The buggy function `initialize` involves checking the current IOLoop instance and creating a new one if there isn't one already. The `make_current` parameter is used to control the behavior of the current IOLoop.

The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new IOLoop instance and make it the current one. It then tries to create another IOLoop instance and expects it to fail, raising a RuntimeError. However, the test instead causes an error when it tries to make the second IOLoop instance the current one.

The cause of the bug is that the current IOLoop is not being handled correctly. The `initialize` function does not correctly take into account possible pending instances, causing it to raise a RuntimeError incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic of the `initialize` function to properly consider the availability of an existing IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one. Also, it should handle the `make_current` parameter appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With these corrections, the failing test `test_force_current` should now pass without raising an error.
