The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is True, the function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` and raise a `RuntimeError` if it exists, but it does not do so.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.initialized():
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
