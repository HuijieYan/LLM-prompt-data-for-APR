The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the incorrect condition check when `make_current` is `True`. The function should raise a `RuntimeError` only if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists, but the current implementation does not account for the case when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check for `make_current` to raise a `RuntimeError` only if a current `IOLoop` exists when `make_current` is `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an existing `IOLoop` is already present. This should resolve the issue with the failing test and the `RuntimeError` that was previously raised.
