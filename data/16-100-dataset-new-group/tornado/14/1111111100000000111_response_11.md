The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is checking the current instance of the `IOLoop` using the `current` function with the `instance` argument set to `False`. It then determines whether to make the current instance based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. However, there is a logical error in the `initialize` function that leads to the incorrect behavior, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if so, it calls the `make_current` method. However, if `make_current` is set to `True` explicitly, it still checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if not, it raises an error. This logic is flawed because if `make_current` is set to `True`, it should ensure that the current instance exists rather than checking if it's None.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter based on whether it is `None`, `True`, or `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current and current_instance is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    
    if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance in the `current_instance` variable. Then, we handle the `make_current` parameter as follows:
- If `make_current` is `True` and `current_instance` is not `None`, we raise an error as the current `IOLoop` already exists.
- If `make_current` is `None` and `current_instance` is `None`, we call the `make_current` method to make the current `IOLoop`.

This corrected logical flow should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
