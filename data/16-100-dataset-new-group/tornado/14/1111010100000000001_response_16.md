The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. This function is designed to initialize the IOLoop and set it as the current IOLoop if needed.

The potential error in the buggy function is with the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if there is a current instance of IOLoop and makes the current one if it does not exist. If `make_current` is provided and is True, it checks if there is already a current instance of IOLoop, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

The cause of the bug is that in the `initialize` function, if `make_current` is not provided, it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists by using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` which implies that it does not create a new instance if it does not exist. This may cause unexpected behavior if there is no current instance of IOLoop.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function can be modified to always make the IOLoop the current instance if `make_current` is True, and only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and a current instance of IOLoop already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
In this corrected version, if `make_current` is True, it checks for the existence of a current instance of IOLoop and raises a `RuntimeError` if one exists. If `make_current` is not provided or is False, it will make the current IOLoop instance only if it does not already exist. This ensures consistent behavior when initializing the IOLoop.
