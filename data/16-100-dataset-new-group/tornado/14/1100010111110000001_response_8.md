The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file seems to have a problem with the logic to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists. 

The test function `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then verify that a RuntimeError is raised when attempting to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.

The specific error message shows that the RuntimeError is raised at the `initialize` function in `tornado/ioloop.py` due to the condition not correctly identifying the existing IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists should be revised to properly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and an instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the revised logic, the condition checks if the `make_current` flag is set, and if so, it correctly identifies whether the IOLoop instance already exists to raise the RuntimeError accordingly. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
