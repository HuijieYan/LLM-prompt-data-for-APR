The buggy function `initialize` is failing the test because it does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. 

The buggy function has the following issues:
1. It does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.
2. It does not handle the case when a current `IOLoop` already exists.

To fix the bug, the function should check if a current `IOLoop` already exists before attempting to make the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if a current `IOLoop` already exists.

To address these issues, the buggy function `initialize` can be corrected as follows:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With the above correction, the function should now properly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test.
