## Analyze the buggy function

The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the class `IOLoop`. This method is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance, and it takes an optional argument `make_current`.

## Identify potential error locations

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The conditional statements for `make_current is None` and `make_current is not None`.
2. Calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and `self.make_current()`.

## Explain the cause of the bug

The bug in the `initialize` method arises from the way it handles the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, and if so, it makes the current instance. However, the condition seems to be incorrect because it checks for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` which might not be the intended behavior. Similarly, when `make_current` is not `None`, it attempts to make the instance current without checking if there is already a current instance.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statements to correctly handle the `make_current` argument. Additionally, we should check the state of the current IOLoop instance before making the instance current. It's also important to ensure that the `make_current` parameter properly respects the behavior described in the class documentation.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
