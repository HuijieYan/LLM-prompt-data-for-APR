## The corrected version of the initialize function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# Here is the corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The cause of the bug: The bug in the original initialize function is that it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance incorrectly, leading to a RuntimeError being raised when it shouldn't be.

Strategy for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance in the if and elif conditions and handling the conditions accordingly.

The corrected version of the function fixes the bug by checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance correctly and raising a RuntimeError only when necessary.
