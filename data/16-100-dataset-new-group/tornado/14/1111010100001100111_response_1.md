The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logic error where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then tries to make it current even if it already exists. The logic is conflicting, leading to the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check if `make_current` is `True` and whether the current `IOLoop` instance is already set. If it is, then we should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current() is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
``` 

This version simplifies the logic to check if `make_current` is `None` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and then it makes the current `IOLoop`. In the case where `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
