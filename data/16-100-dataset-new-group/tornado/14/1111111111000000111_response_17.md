The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop and control its current instance. The issue arises when trying to force the IOLoop to become the current instance using the `make_current` argument. This is causing a conflict when there is already an existing current IOLoop.

The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are:
1. Incorrect checking of the existing current IOLoop using `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.
2. Incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when trying to force the current instance while it already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current instance of the IOLoop.

To fix the bug:
1. Check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current instance, then raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. If `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance, then make the current instance.
3. If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance, then make the current instance.
4. If `make_current` is `False`, do not attempt to make the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the initialization and setting of the current instance of the IOLoop, resolving the issue and causing the failing test to pass.
