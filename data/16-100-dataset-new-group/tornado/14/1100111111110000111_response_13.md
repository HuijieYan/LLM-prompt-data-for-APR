The bug in the code provided is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. It checks whether the current IOLoop instance exists before initializing a new one, but the logic appears to be incorrect, as it produces a RuntimeError even when the current IOLoop instance does not exist.

The failing test calls `IOLoop(make_current=True)` to initialize a new IOLoop instance with the intention of making it the current one. However, the logic in the `initialize` method incorrectly raises a RuntimeError when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, indicating that the current IOLoop instance does not exist. This causes the failing test to produce the error message "RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists."

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be modified to correctly handle the case when the current IOLoop instance does not exist. It should also be made sure that the `make_current` parameter is properly handled.

The corrected version of the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class should be as follows:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method now correctly checks if the current IOLoop instance exists before initializing a new one and sets it as the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to True. This corrected version of the method should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
