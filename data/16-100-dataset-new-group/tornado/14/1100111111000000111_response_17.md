The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is intended to initialize the IOLoop object, but it has a bug that causes it to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError`. The bug seems to be related to the logic inside the `initialize` function and its interaction with the `current` and `make_current` functions from the same file, and a failing test in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`. The GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" also highlights this bug.

The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when it checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists. If a current IOLoop instance does not exist, it tries to create one using the `make_current` method. However, if the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists. But the current logic doesn't handle this case correctly.

To fix this bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the check for an existing IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if existing_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if existing_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and handle the `make_current` argument as expected.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
