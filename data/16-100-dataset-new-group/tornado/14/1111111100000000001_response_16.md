The bug in the `initialize` function is that it doesn't handle the case where `make_current` is `False`. If `make_current` is `False`, it should not attempt to make the IOLoop current. 

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif not make_current:
        pass  # Do nothing if make_current is explicitly set to False
```

In the corrected version, the function now includes a condition to handle the case where `make_current` is `False`, and it simply does nothing in that case.
