The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py` is causing the test to fail and raise a `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error. The `initialize` function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before calling the `make_current` method, but the logic is incorrect and leading to the error.

The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of `make_current` argument and the condition for checking if the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. The error message and the GitHub issue both point to the fact that the check for the current `IOLoop` instance is not functioning as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is flawed. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should raise an error only if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. However, the current implementation is raising the error even when the current `IOLoop` instance exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` argument, and also fix the condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `elif` condition checks if `make_current` is `True`, and then it correctly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` before raising the error. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the related GitHub issue.
