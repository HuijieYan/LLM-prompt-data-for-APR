### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
- This function interacts with the `current` and `make_current` functions from the same file or class, which might be causing the bug.
- The failing test indicates that when `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".
- The related GitHub issue suggests that the problem occurs with the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` call on line 252.

### Potential Error Location:
- The issue might be related to how the `current` function is returning a value.
- The condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop might not be correctly handled.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The `initialize` function is intended to set up the IOLoop, including ensuring the current IOLoop exists. However, the condition checking for the existence of the current IOLoop is not working as expected.
- The bug is likely caused by the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` call in the `initialize` function not properly handling the check for an existing IOLoop.

### Bug-Fixing Strategy:
- Ensure that the `current` function returns the correct value to indicate the existence of the current IOLoop.
- Check the conditions in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.
- Verify the behavior of the `make_current` function in relation to setting up the current IOLoop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class methods and functions

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `initialize` function properly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop and raises an error only when it actually exists. The condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop is fixed to avoid the erroneous RuntimeError.
