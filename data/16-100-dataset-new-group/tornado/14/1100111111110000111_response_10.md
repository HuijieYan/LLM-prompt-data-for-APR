    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

Explaination:
1. Analysis:
   - The function `initialize` seems to have a logic issue where it checks for the opposite condition to determine whether to raise a `RuntimeError`.
   - The failing test indicates that 'IOLoop.current(instance=False)' is None, but the code is raising a `RuntimeError` for an existing IOLoop.

2. Potential error locations:
   - The logic within the 'initialize' function, specifically in the conditions for 'if make_current is None' and 'elif make_current'.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The 'initialize' function has a logic issue where it checks the opposite condition for 'if make_current is None' and 'elif make_current' leading to incorrect error messages being raised.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the conditions within the 'initialize' function to have the correct checks for the state of the IOLoop, and whether it should raise `RuntimeError` or not.

5. Given the explanation and strategy, the corrected version of the buggy function is provided above.
