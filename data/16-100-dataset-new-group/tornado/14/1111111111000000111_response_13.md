## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`.
2. The test function `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is failing due to the bug in the `initialize` function.
3. The GitHub issue points to a potential problem at line 252 in `ioloop.py` where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` at line 252.
2. The condition `if make_current` followed by `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` at line 256.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because at line 252, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is evaluated as True, indicating that the current `IOLoop` does not exist. However, at line 256, when `make_current` is True, it still checks if the current `IOLoop` does not exist. This contradicts the logic and leads to the RuntimeError being raised even when the current `IOLoop` does not exist.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` exists is consistent with the intended behavior of the `initialize` function. Additionally, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument needs to be adjusted.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None: 
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None or make_current:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the function, the conditions have been adjusted to ensure that the logic is consistent with the intended behavior. The checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` and the handling of the `make_current` argument have been modified to resolve the bug.
