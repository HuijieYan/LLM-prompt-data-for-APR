### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is part of the class `IOLoop` in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`. This function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before creating a new one. The error message indicates that the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when attempting to make the current `IOLoop` instance even if it already exists.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect conditional checks within the `initialize` function
2. Incorrect behavior of the `make_current` method

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is within the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class. The function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists, which is contrary to its intended behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks within the `initialize` function. Additionally, we should update the behavior of the `make_current` method to align with the intended functionality.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the `initialize` function now correctly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current` and raises an error only when appropriate. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as intended.
