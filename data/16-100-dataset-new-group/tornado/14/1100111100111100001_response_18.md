The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class. It takes an optional parameter `make_current`. The function first checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls the `make_current` method of the current instance if there is no current instance.

If `make_current` is not None, it checks if `make_current` is True and if there is no current instance, it raises a RuntimeError.

The failing test is trying to initialize an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but it is raising a RuntimeError because it thinks that a current IOLoop already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect. This condition is checking if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, but it should be checking if there is a current instance of the specific `IOLoop` being initialized.

To fix the bug, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should be replaced with `if self.current(instance=False) is None` to check if the specific `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
