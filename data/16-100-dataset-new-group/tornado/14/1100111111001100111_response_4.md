## The buggy function and its potential errors
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance. However, the logic currently has some potential errors. 

1. If `make_current` is None, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it is None, it calls `self.make_current()`.
2. If `make_current` is True, it also checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it's not None, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. There is a confusion between the class method `IOLoop.current` and the function `current` defined outside the class. This might cause incorrect resolution of the method call.

## Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by the confusion and incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current `IOLoop` instance's existence.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance's existence and the `make_current` parameter handling needs to be revised. Also, the class methods need to be accessed using `self` and the correct resolution should be used.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing methods and functions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, I have replaced `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` with `self.current(instance=False)` to access the class method from within the instance. Additionally, I modified the condition for raising `RuntimeError` to `if self.current(instance=False) is not None`. This corrected version should address the issues and pass the failing test.
