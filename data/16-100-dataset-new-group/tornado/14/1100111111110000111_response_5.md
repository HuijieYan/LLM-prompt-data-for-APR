The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. This method checks if the current IOLoop doesn't already exist and then tries to make the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't. However, the bug causes a `RuntimeError` to be raised when it shouldn't be, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is True, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. The intention of the code is to make the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't already exist, but it is incorrectly raising an error instead.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True. We also need to ensure that the `make_current` method is called when needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `if` condition for `make_current` now checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before raising a `RuntimeError`. This ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when the current IOLoop instance already exists, as per the intended functionality.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue as reported on GitHub.
