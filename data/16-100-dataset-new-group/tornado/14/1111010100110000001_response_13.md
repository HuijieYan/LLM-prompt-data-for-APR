The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class and it is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object with the option to make it the currently running `IOLoop` if needed. The error message indicates that when attempting to force the current `IOLoop` (by setting `make_current=True`), it is throwing a `RuntimeError` because it thinks that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current is None:` within the `initialize` function is incorrectly calling `self.make_current()` without checking if there is a current `IOLoop` instance. This results in an attempt to replace the current `IOLoop` even when it already exists, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug, the function should only call `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`. If it is set to `None`, it should only set the `IOLoop` as current if no instance already exists.

Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will only attempt to make the `IOLoop` the current instance if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, and it will check for the existence of a current instance before making it current. This should resolve the `RuntimeError` issue.
