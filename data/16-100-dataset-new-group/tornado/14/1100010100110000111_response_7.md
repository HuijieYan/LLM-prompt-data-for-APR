### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop, and it checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance. However, the error message and the GitHub issue indicate that the function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when it should not.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error might be occurring in the condition where it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and decides whether to raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug seems to be in the logic of the `initialize` function. It is incorrectly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance, and as per the error message and GitHub issue, it is raising the `RuntimeError` even when the IOLoop instance is None.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when the IOLoop instance is None. This might involve adjusting the conditions and the flow of the function to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when it is appropriate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise RuntimeError only when IOLoop exists
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is retained, and the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` is modified to correctly check for the existence of the IOLoop instance. The `RuntimeError` is only raised when the IOLoop already exists.
