Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance, and the bug is related to the conditional logic within this function.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional statements that check for the existing current `IOLoop` instance and the value of `make_current`.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the existing current `IOLoop` instance is not properly applied, leading to the "already exists" error being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to rewrite the conditional logic to ensure that the checks for the existing current `IOLoop` instance and the value of `make_current` are properly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the function based on the analysis:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        # Check if make_current is None
        if make_current is None:
            # Check if there is no current IOLoop instance
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        # Check if make_current is True
        elif make_current:
            # Check if there is an existing current IOLoop instance
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional logic is rewritten to accurately check if the current IOLoop instance exists and handle the `make_current` argument accordingly. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
