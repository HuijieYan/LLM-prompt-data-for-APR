## Analysis of the buggy function:
The initialize function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, ensuring that there is a current instance of the IOLoop. However, there are potential errors in the logic that could cause the function to behave incorrectly.

## Potential error locations:
1. The conditional statements inside the function might not be correctly handling the cases where make_current is None or True.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug might occur because the logic inside the function does not appropriately handle the cases where make_current is None or True. This could result in the IOLoop not being properly initialized or an incorrect RuntimeError being raised.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditional statements are correctly handling the cases where make_current is None or True, and that the IOLoop is properly initialized based on the condition.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first retrieve the current instance of IOLoop and store it in a variable. Then, we use this variable to check the conditions and initialize the IOLoop accordingly. This ensures that the function handles the cases where make_current is None or True correctly and initializes the IOLoop as intended.
