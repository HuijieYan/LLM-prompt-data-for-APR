The buggy function has a problem with the logic inside the `initialize` method. It checks if `make_current` is `None` and then proceeds to call `self.make_current()` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. However, when `make_current` is explicitly `True`, it first checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then raises a `RuntimeError` if it is not `None`. This contradicts the behavior and does not align with the intention to set `make_current` to `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is explicitly `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions and methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, when `make_current` is explicitly `True`, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, and if it is, it raises a `RuntimeError` as intended.

This correction should resolve the failing test case and ensure that the logic in the `initialize` method behaves as expected.
