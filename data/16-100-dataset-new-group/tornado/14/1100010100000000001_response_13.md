## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is meant to initialize the IOLoop, but there are several issues with the logic in the function.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if make_current is None` and the subsequent call to `self.make_current()` may cause unnecessary initialization.
2. The condition `elif make_current` seems redundant and could lead to incorrect behavior.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the function is that it does not handle the initialization of `make_current` correctly. It also does not check the current state of the IOLoop before attempting to initialize it, leading to potential errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to simplify the logic and ensure that the IOLoop is properly initialized based on the value of `make_current`. We also need to check if the IOLoop is already set before attempting to initialize it.

Based on the above analysis, the corrected version simplifies the logic and checks for the existence of the current IOLoop before attempting to initialize it.

By making the `make_current` parameter default to True and simplifying the conditional checks, we ensure that the IOLoop is initialized properly.

By doing so, the corrected version will avoid unnecessary initialization and correctly check if the IOLoop is already set before attempting to initialize it.
