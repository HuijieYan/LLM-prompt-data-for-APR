The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument. It is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance if `make_current` is True, and if not, it should check if there is already a current instance and raise an error if so.

The bug in the function is that when `make_current` is True, it is not properly checking if there is already a current instance before making itself the current instance. This causes the test case `test_force_current` to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to check if there is already a current instance before making the new instance the current one, and raise an error if `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
