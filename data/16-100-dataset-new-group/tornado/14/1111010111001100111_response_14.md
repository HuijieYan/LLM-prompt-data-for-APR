The buggy function `initialize` is meant to initialize the IOLoop instance by setting it as the current instance, if `make_current` is set to `True` and there is no current instance already. However, there seems to be a bug in the logic of the function that causes it to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current instance.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditional statements for checking `make_current` and the checks for the current instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect, leading to the function incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current instance. The failing test `test_force_current` also demonstrates that the behavior of the function is not as expected.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the function needs to be corrected to properly handle cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and to ensure that the function raises `RuntimeError` only when there is an existing current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current` and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
