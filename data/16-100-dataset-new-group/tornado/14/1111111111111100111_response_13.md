Based on the analysis, the bug is causing the RuntimeError to be raised when make_current=True, even though IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None. The bug occurs due to the missing reference to the current instance of the IOLoop when make_current is True.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the initialize function to correctly handle the make_current parameter.
2. Add the current instance of IOLoop when make_current is True.
3. Make sure to check if the current instance already exists before setting the new instance as the current one.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This updated version correctly handles the make_current parameter and checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before setting a new one. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
