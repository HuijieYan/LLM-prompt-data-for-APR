#### Case 1 Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class. It takes an optional parameter `make_current`, which defaults to `None`. If `make_current` is not provided or is `True`, it should call the `make_current` method of the `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The failing test is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, but it's raising a `RuntimeError` because a current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Case 1 Error Location
The bug seems to be located in the logic for checking if a current `IOLoop` exists and in the conditional statements for handling the `make_current` parameter.

### Case 1 Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the logic for checking if a current `IOLoop` exists is not functioning correctly. It is not properly handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Case 1 Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for checking if a current `IOLoop` exists is accurate. Additionally, we need to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            elif make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the corrected version, I've combined the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True` into a single conditional statement. If `make_current` is `None` or `True`, it will attempt to make the current `IOLoop` and then raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists.
