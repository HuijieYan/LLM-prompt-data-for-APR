### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not handling the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is actually not `None`.
2. The `make_current` argument is not being properly checked and utilized within the function.

### Cause of the bug
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop, and especially the `make_current` argument. However, it fails to correctly handle the case when the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, leading to the erroneous `RuntimeError`. The GitHub issue also confirms this problem, indicating that there is a discrepancy between the check for `None` and the subsequent raise of `already exists`.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Modify the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to properly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.
2. Ensure that the `make_current` argument is properly checked and handled within the function, such that it only triggers the `make_current` action when necessary.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the function, the condition `if current_instance is None` is used to properly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`. Additionally, the `make_current` argument is properly checked and utilized within the function.
