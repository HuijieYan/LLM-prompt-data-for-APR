## Correction:

### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if a second attempt to create the current IOLoop instance raises a `RuntimeError`. The error message indicates that the `initialize` method is raising a `RuntimeError` for the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.

### Bug Location:
The issue is located in the `initialize` method when `make_current` is `True`. It incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` method. It needs to check if a current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`, and only raise a `RuntimeError` when an instance already exists.

### Fix Strategy:
The fix involves modifying the conditional check for `make_current` and the existence of a current IOLoop instance within the `initialize` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is changed to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to fix the bug. This ensures that a `RuntimeError` is only raised if a current IOLoop instance exists when `make_current` is `True`.
