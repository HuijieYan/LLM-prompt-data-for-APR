## Analysis
The initialize function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object with the provided make_current parameter. However, the current implementation is not handling the make_current parameter correctly, leading to the failing test and the GitHub issue.

## Error location
The issue seems to be in the conditional checks for the make_current parameter.

## Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the function is not properly checking the existing current IOLoop instance before initializing a new one. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised even when the current IOLoop instance is None.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to modify the conditional checks for make_current to ensure that the existing current IOLoop instance is properly handled before initializing a new one.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we first obtain the current instance of IOLoop before making any decisions. Then, we use this information to properly handle the make_current parameter and avoid raising a RuntimeError when it's not necessary. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
