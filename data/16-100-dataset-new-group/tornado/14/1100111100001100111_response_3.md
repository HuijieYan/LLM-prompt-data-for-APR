The buggy function is the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. It takes an input parameter `make_current` and is supposed to initialize the IOLoop by setting it as the current instance if it doesn't already exist.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are at the if-elif statement where it checks for the `make_current` parameter, and in the conditions where it calls the `IOLoop.current` and `self.make_current()` functions.

The cause of the bug is that the logic to check if the current IOLoop instance exists or not is incorrect. When `make_current` is not provided, the function should create a new IOLoop instance if it doesn't already exist. When `make_current` is True, it should raise an error if an IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check and handle the `make_current` parameter and the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and handles the `make_current` parameter to create a new instance or raise an error based on the existing state.
