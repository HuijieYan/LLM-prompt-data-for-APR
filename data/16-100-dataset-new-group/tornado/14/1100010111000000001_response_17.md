The issue with the buggy function `initialize` seems to be related to the `make_current` parameter and how it interacts with the `IOLoop.current` method. The failing test `test_force_current` is attempting to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempting to create another `IOLoop` instance with the same parameter, which should raise a `RuntimeError`. 

The `initialize` function doesn't seem to handle this scenario correctly. It should check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True` is passed, and if so, raise a `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the function checks if `make_current` is `None` and if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, then it checks if `make_current` is `True` and raises a `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists. This should fix the bug and make the function work as expected when tested with the failing test.
