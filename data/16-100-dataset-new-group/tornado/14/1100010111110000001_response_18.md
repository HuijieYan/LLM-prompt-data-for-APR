The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is not handling the `make_current` initialization correctly, as evidenced by the failing test in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`. The test is expecting an error to be raised when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` for the second time, but this is not happening.

The buggy function is not properly checking if the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`, which causes the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, we should modify the initialize function to check if the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. If it does, we should raise a RuntimeError. If it does not, we should proceed with the initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
