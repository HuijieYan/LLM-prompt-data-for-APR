The issue with the buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is that it is not checking its own instance of `IOLoop` to see if it is already the current `IOLoop`. The bug arises from the logic in the `initialize` function where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and then raises an error "current IOLoop already exists" regardless.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function should be checking if the current instance of `IOLoop` is the same as the instance on which `initialize` is called. Instead, it just checks if any instance of `IOLoop` exists and always raises the error message.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should compare the current instance of `IOLoop` with the instance on which `initialize` is called using a conditional statement. If they are the same, it should just return immediately, and only raise the "already exists" error if a different instance of `IOLoop` exists.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance != self:  # Check if the current instance is not the same as this instance
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance and current_instance != self:  # Only raise error if current instance is different
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
