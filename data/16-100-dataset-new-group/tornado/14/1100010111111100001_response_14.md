The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the make_current parameter. The function is supposed to check if an IOLoop already exists, and if not, create a new one. However, the buggy function is not correctly checking for the presence of an existing IOLoop instance.

The failing test is expecting that when make_current is True, the function should raise a RuntimeError if an IOLoop already exists. However, the buggy function is not performing this check correctly, leading to the test failure.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the initialize function to properly check for the existence of an IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the make_current parameter and pass the failing test.
