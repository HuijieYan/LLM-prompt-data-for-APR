### Fixing the bug

#### Bug Cause
The buggy function is intended to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before making the current IOLoop. However, the condition for checking the current IOLoop instance is incorrect, leading to the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the current IOLoop instance to accurately determine if it already exists before proceeding with making it the current IOLoop.

#### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition has been updated to first check if the `make_current` parameter is None or True. Then, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is not None before deciding to raise an error or make the current IOLoop.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
