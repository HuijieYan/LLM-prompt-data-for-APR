The bug in the provided function is causing the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" to be raised when it shouldn't be. This is inconsistent with the logic of the code and the expected behavior.

The bug is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is None, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None and if so, calls `self.make_current()`. When `make_current` is True, it again checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None and if not, raises the RuntimeError.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the current instance of `IOLoop` is incorrect. In both cases, it incorrectly checks if the current instance is None and it should only check for None when `make_current` is None.

To fix this bug, a correct strategy would be to modify the conditional statements to check for the presence or absence of the current instance of `IOLoop` based on the value of `make_current`. When `make_current` is None, it should check if the current instance is None. When `make_current` is True, it should check if the current instance is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method should now properly check for the presence or absence of the current instance of `IOLoop` based on the value of `make_current`, and the RuntimeError should no longer be raised when it shouldn't be.
