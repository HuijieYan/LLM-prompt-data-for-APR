The potential error locations within the buggy function are within the `initialize` function where the conditional statements are checking for `make_current` option and calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement for `make_current` is not handling the case where `make_current` is set to `True`. It should not be raising a `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement for `make_current` to handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. We can remove the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and simply call `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
