The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class appears to be designed to initialize a new instance of the `IOLoop` class. The function takes an argument `make_current` and assigns the current instance of `IOLoop` based on its value, or raises a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists regardless of the value of `make_current`, which leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` argument.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

The correction involves changing `elif make_current` to `elif make_current is True` in order to properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`. Additionally, the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` is updated to check if a current instance exists or not based on the value of `make_current`.
