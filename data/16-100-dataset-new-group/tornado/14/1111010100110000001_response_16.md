# Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance, and it should only do so if there is no current instance already.
2. The error message indicates that when attempting to initialize a new `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, it is raising a `RuntimeError` because the current `IOLoop` already exists.

# Potential Error Locations
1. The `initialize` function conditionally checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and then attempts to set it as the current if it doesn't exist or if `make_current=True`. 
2. The bug seems to be associated with the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:`.

# Cause of the Bug
1. The conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is likely causing the bug. This condition checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, but it should only execute if `make_current` is set to `True`. 
2. The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

# Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
2. When `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if there is already a current instance. Otherwise, it should proceed with setting the current instance only if it doesn't exist.

# Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the conditional check for `make_current` being `True` has been fixed to raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This should resolve the bug and align with the intended behavior of the function.
