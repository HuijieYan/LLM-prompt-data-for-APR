The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is not correctly checking for the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. The `make_current` function should only be called if there is no current IOLoop instance, but the buggy function is not checking this properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:  # Check for True explicitly
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method properly checks if the current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to make it the current instance. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
