The bug is caused by the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The function is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument, which results in the error "current IOLoop already exists". The failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file is attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and it expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised if a current `IOLoop` already exists, which is not happening.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not properly handle the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is `None`, it is supposed to create a new `IOLoop` instance as the current instance if none exists. When `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` already exists. However, the function does not handle these cases correctly, leading to the bug.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument. If `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance, it should create a new `IOLoop` instance as the current one. If `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it should not try to make the new instance the current one.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass, and the GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" should be resolved.
