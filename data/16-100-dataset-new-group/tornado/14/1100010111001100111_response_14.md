The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file is causing a problem with the test case `test_force_current` in the `ioloop_test.py` file. The test is failing with a `RuntimeError` when attempting to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

The buggy function `initialize` is intended to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and, if not, then make the current `IOLoop`. However, it is failing to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

The GitHub issue indicates that the problem occurs at line 252 in `ioloop.py` where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and questions why a "already exists" RuntimeError is being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make it the current instance when `make_current=True`.

Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function now checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make it the current instance when `make_current=True`. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
