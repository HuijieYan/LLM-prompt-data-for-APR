The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The method is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance and optionally make it the current IOLoop.

The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`. In this case, the method incorrectly checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and if it does, it raises a `RuntimeError` instead of proceeding to make the current instance.

To fix the bug, we should remove the check for the current instance when `make_current` is `True` and always proceed to make the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the method will always make the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to `True`, regardless of whether a current instance already exists.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
