The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is causing a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This error occurs when the function tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance but it already exists.

The potential error location is:
- In the `initialize` function, where it checks for the current `IOLoop` instance and tries to make it current if `make_current` argument is set to `True`.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists properly. If `make_current` is `True` and there's already a current instance, it should not try to make the current instance again.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to only make the current instance if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance already.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None:
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the function will now check if `make_current` is `True` and there's no current instance before trying to make the current instance, and it will also handle the case when `make_current` is explicitly set to `False`. After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test.
