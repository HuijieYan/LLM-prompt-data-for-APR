The issue with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is that it incorrectly handles the `make_current` argument. When `make_current=True`, the function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` and raise a `RuntimeError` if so. However, the current logic incorrectly checks if there is no `IOLoop`, and this leads to the error in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that it correctly checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Use else here to fix the logic
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` argument and pass the failing test.
