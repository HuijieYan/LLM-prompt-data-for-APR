## Analysis
The buggy function is designed to initialize an IOLoop, but it has a few potential error locations. 
1. The condition `if make_current is None` is checking if `make_current` is `None`, but the intended check is for `make_current` to be `True`.
2. The function is calling `self.make_current()` without checking if `make_current` is `True`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition `if make_current is None` and the lack of a check before calling `self.make_current()`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
- Change the condition `if make_current is None` to `if make_current is not True`.
- Add a check before calling `self.make_current()` to ensure that `make_current` is `True`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
