### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. If not, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. The issue on GitHub suggests that there is a problem with the logic in line 252, where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and then raises an "already exists" error.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error location is in the `elif` branch where it checks if `make_current` is `True` and current `IOLoop` instance exists.


### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect logic in the `elif` branch. It should not raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the `IOLoop` current instance exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `elif` branch to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance exists without raising a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # modified logic here
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # check if current instance exists
            return  # do nothing if current instance exists
        self.make_current()
```
