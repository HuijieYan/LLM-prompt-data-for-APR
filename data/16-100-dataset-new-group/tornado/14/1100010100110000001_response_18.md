## Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised, which is unexpected. This indicates that the logic in the `initialize` function is not working as intended, resulting in the error being raised when it shouldn't be.

## Identifying potential error locations
The potential error location is within the `initialize` function, specifically in the logic for checking if the current IOLoop exists and whether to make it current or raise a RuntimeError.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements within the `initialize` function are not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`. The control flow is not appropriately checking the current status of the IOLoop and deciding whether to make it current or raise an error.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditional statements are correctly evaluating the current state of the IOLoop and making the necessary decisions based on the `make_current` parameter.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first store the current instance of the IOLoop in the `current_instance` variable. Then we use this variable to check if the IOLoop exists and make appropriate decisions based on the `make_current` parameter. This ensures that the logic functions as intended and should pass the failing test.
