    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

## Analysis and Explanation
The buggy function "initialize" is meant to check and set the current IOLoop instance, but it has a logic error in handling the "make_current" argument and checking for the current instance. The bug occurs in the elif statement where it checks if make_current is True before checking for the current IOLoop instance. Additionally, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance is already present is incorrect.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Change the condition for checking "make_current" to "if make_current is None" instead of "if make_current is not None"
2. Change the condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance is already present to "if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None" instead of "if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None"
3. Simplify the logic by removing unnecessary conditions and elif statements.

By making these changes, the bug in the function will be fixed.
