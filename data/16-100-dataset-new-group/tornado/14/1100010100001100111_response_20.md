### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` seems to be conflicting with the `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` statement.
2. The logic seems to be inconsistent and may not be handling the `make_current` parameter as intended.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by inconsistent logic in handling the `make_current` parameter and checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance exists, but the subsequent logic doesn't align with this check, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter and checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance is consistent. We should also refactor the conditions to make the code more readable and easier to understand.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we store the current IOLoop instance in a variable for better readability and consistency in the code. We then use this variable to check for the existence of the current instance and handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
