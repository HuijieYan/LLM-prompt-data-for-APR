The buggy function `initialize` is trying to check for the existence of the current IOLoop and make it the current one if it doesn't exist. However, it is not handling the case where `make_current` is provided but the current IOLoop already exists.

Error locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` does not handle the case where `make_current` is provided but the current IOLoop already exists.
2. The condition `elif make_current:` does not handle the case where `make_current` is True but the current IOLoop already exists.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incomplete handling of the `make_current` parameter and the check for the existence of the current IOLoop.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the conditions to handle the case where `make_current` is provided but the current IOLoop already exists.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # added condition to handle make_current=True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to handle the case where `make_current` is provided and the current IOLoop already exists. If the current IOLoop exists and `make_current` is True, it will raise a RuntimeError.
