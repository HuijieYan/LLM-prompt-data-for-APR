The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize a new instance of the class, making it the current IOLoop if necessary. However, the bug causes the function to raise a `RuntimeError` even if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current IOLoop.

The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is being raised on line 255 of `tornado/ioloop.py`. This happens if the `make_current` argument is `True` and the check for the current IOLoop instance fails.

To fix the bug, the logic of the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the current IOLoop instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version checks whether `make_current` is `None` or `True` and then checks the current instance of the IOLoop to determine whether it should become the current IOLoop. This should resolve the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.
