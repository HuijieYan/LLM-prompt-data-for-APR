Potential error locations in the buggy code:
1. The logic for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists is incorrect.
2. The usage of the `current` method from the `IOLoop` class may not be intended.

Cause of the bug:
The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize an IOLoop, and if `make_current` is True, it should check if an IOLoop already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. However, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check for the existence of an IOLoop, which is incorrect. Additionally, the `make_current` method is not being called correctly.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different method to check for the existence of an IOLoop instance.
2. Correct the usage of the `make_current` method to ensure that the IOLoop is properly initialized.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if getattr(IOLoop, '_instance', None) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if getattr(IOLoop, '_instance', None) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We have used `getattr(IOLoop, '_instance', None)` to check for the existence of an IOLoop instance.
- We have corrected the condition for checking if an IOLoop already exists and for calling the `make_current` method.
