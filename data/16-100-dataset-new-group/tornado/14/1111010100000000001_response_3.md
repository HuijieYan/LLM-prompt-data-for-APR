Potential error locations within the `initialize` function:
1. The `self.make_current()` line may not be functioning as intended.
2. The `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` calls may not be returning the expected value.

Cause of the bug:
The `initialize` function is designed to control the behavior of the current IOLoop instance. However, the logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop instance is not clear. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, especially with the `make_current` argument.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop instance is clear and accurate.
2. Verify that the `make_current` argument is handled correctly and consistently.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
1. The `make_current` argument is set to default to `True` for consistency and clarity.
2. The logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop instance is updated to ensure correctness in different scenarios.
