The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is `True`, it should check if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, then make the current IOLoop. However, it is currently raising a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance doesn't exist.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic to only raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if IOLoop instance exists before making it current
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
