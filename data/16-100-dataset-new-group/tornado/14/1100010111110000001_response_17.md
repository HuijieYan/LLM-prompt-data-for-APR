The issue in the `initialize` function is that it doesn't handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True`. As a result, the function always tries to make the current IOLoop, leading to the RuntimeError when another IOLoop is already the current one.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to explicitly check if `make_current` is set to `True` and then handle that case accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # explicitly check if make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adding the check `elif make_current is True`, the function will now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and avoid trying to make the current IOLoop when it already exists.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
