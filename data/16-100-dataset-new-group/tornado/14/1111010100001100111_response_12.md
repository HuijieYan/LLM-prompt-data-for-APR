### Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The function is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, there are issues with the current implementation:

1. The conditional check for `make_current is None` results in attempting to make the current `IOLoop` if there is no current instance, which is incorrect.

2. The conditional check for `make_current` results in raising an error if there is already a current instance, which is redundant because the initial check already handles this case.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks to correctly handle the scenarios where `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or `False`. We also need to remove the redundant conditional check that raises an error.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    elif make_current:
        IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we removed the redundant check for the existence of a current `IOLoop`. The function now first checks if `make_current` is `None`. If it is `None`, it only gets the current `IOLoop` instance, without attempting to make it the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it gets the current instance and then makes it the current instance. If `make_current` is `False`, it does nothing, allowing the current instance (if it exists) to remain unchanged. This behavior aligns with the intended functionality described in the class documentation.
