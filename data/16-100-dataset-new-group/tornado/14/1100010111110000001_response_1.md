The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is failing the test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` with the error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`. The issue arises when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.

The bug in the function `initialize` is that it is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is True. The function should only raise a RuntimeError if a current IOLoop already exists, and not if it does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check for the existence of a current IOLoop before trying to make the current instance. If a current instance already exists when `make_current` is True, then we should raise the RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) and make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the case when `make_current` is True and pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
