The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it is not correctly checking whether a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to make the current `IOLoop`. This results in a `RuntimeError` being raised when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to check if `make_current` is True and if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to make the current `IOLoop`. If a current instance already exists, then simply do nothing. If it does not exist, then make the current `IOLoop`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                return  # Do nothing if current IOLoop already exists
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is True and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, we simply return without doing anything. Then we continue with the original checks for `make_current` being None or True, and perform the necessary actions based on those checks.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass.
