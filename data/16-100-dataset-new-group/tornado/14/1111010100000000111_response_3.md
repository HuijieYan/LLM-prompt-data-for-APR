The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class initializes the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that on line 252, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for `None`, and if it is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists." This behavior is contradictory, as checking for `None` and then raising an error if it is `None` does not make sense.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and raising the error is conflicting. The intention seems to be to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raise an error if it does, but the current logic does not achieve this.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and raising an error needs to be modified. Also, the default value for `make_current` needs to be considered for proper initialization.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `make_current` parameter has a default value of `True`, and the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and raising an error has been modified to be more consistent. Now, if `make_current` is True, it will check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raise an error if it does. If `make_current` is False, it will make the current `IOLoop` instance if it does not already exist.
