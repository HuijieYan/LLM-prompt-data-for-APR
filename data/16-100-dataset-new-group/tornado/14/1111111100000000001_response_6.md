The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class has a bug in the conditional logic. There are a couple of potential error locations within the function:

1. The `make_current` argument is not being handled properly. The condition `if make_current is None` should be `if make_current is None:` to properly handle the case where `make_current` is not provided.
2. The logic inside the `if make_current is None:` block is incorrect. It should check if the current IOLoop instance is None and, if so, make it the current instance using `self.make_current()`.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument and not making the IOLoop instance the current instance when it should.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Properly handle the `make_current` argument by using `if make_current is None:` and `if make_current:` conditions.
2. Inside the `if make_current is None:` block, check if the current IOLoop instance is None and, if so, make it the current instance using `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `make_current` argument is handled properly, and the logic inside the `if make_current is None:` block has been fixed to set the IOLoop instance as the current instance when necessary.
