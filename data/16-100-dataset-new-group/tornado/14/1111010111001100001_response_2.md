The bug in the `initialize` function is that it doesn't handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` correctly. Instead of checking if there is already a current IOLoop instance, it is always trying to make the current IOLoop without checking if it already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the function will now correctly check if the current IOLoop instance exists before trying to make it the current IOLoop when `make_current` is set to `True`.

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test.
