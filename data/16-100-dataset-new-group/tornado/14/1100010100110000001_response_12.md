The bug in the given function is that the condition to check if the IOLoop instance already exists is incorrect. It is raising a `RuntimeError` even when make_current is True. This is causing the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the condition to check if the IOLoop instance already exists should be adjusted so that it raises the `RuntimeError` only if the make_current is False and an IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This correction ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when make_current is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.
