### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`. The issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and the function checks if the current `IOLoop` already exists. The bug causes a `RuntimeError` to be raised even when the current `IOLoop` does not exist.

### Bug Explanation
The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when the current `IOLoop` doesn't exist.

The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` already exists, but the failing test with `make_current=True` shows that `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is actually `None`. This means that the check for the existing `IOLoop` is not functioning as intended.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it's necessary to update the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly check the availability of the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should only make the `IOLoop` current if it doesn't already exist.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance is updated. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` already exists and only raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. Otherwise, it proceeds to make the `IOLoop` current.
