The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` class and make the newly initialized `IOLoop` current if specified. However, the bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is incorrectly checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` when it should check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. Additionally, the condition `if make_current is None:` does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `False`.

To fix the bug, we should refactor the conditions in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or `False` and check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By making these changes, the function now correctly handles the cases where `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or `False` and correctly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. This should resolve the `RuntimeError` issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
