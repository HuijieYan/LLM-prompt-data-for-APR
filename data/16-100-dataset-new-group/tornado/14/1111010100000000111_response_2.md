The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a bug related to the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and raising an error if it already exists. The issue on GitHub points out that on line 252, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked if it is `None`, and then it raises an error if it already exists. This logic seems contradictory and needs to be fixed.

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is not properly handling the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary check for `None` and simplify the logic for making the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we simply check if `make_current` is `True`, and then directly check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`. If it is not `None`, we raise an error, otherwise we make the current `IOLoop` instance. The unnecessary `if` conditions and the unnecessary `None` check have been removed for better clarity and consistency.
