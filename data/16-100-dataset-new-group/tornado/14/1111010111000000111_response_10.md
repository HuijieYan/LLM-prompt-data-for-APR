Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in `tornado/ioloop.py`.
2. The potential error locations in the `initialize` method are the conditions for checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None or not.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current=True`, it checks if the current instance is None, and if it is not None, it raises a RuntimeError. However, in the failing test, it is trying to create a second current instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a RuntimeError, but the current implementation is not doing so, leading to the failing test.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
In the `initialize` method, modify the conditions for checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None or not. It should always raise a RuntimeError if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance.

Code for the Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... [Existing code] ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:  # Add an else block to raise a RuntimeError if make_current is None and there is already a current instance
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change the condition to check if current instance is not None
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the bug in the `IOLoop` class should be fixed, and the failing test should pass.
