The buggy function `initialize` is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter when it is set to `True`, as shown in the failing test `test_force_current`. The bug causes the `IOLoop` class to not handle the `make_current` parameter correctly, resulting in the RuntimeError not being raised as expected.

Based on the analysis of the buggy code and the failing test, the bug is located in the `initialize` function where the `make_current` parameter is not being properly handled when set to `True`. The code does not correctly check if the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, an additional check is needed to verify whether the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is `True`. If it does, a RuntimeError should be raised, and the `make_current` function should not be called.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    # ... existing code ...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            
            self.make_current()
```

With the corrected function, the provided failing test `test_force_current` should now pass, as the bug has been fixed by properly handling the `make_current` parameter.
