The issue in the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the case where `make_current=True`. The function is supposed to raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop already exists, but it is not doing so.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current is None` does not properly handle the case where `make_current=True`. As a result, the function does not raise a RuntimeError when it should.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Check for make_current=True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop already exists, resolving the issue posted on GitHub and passing the failing test.
