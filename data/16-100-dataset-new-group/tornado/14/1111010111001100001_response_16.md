The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the current `IOLoop` and make it the thread's current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True`. However, the bug causes an `RuntimeError` to be raised even if there is no current `IOLoop` present.

The cause of the bug is in the conditional check:
```python
if make_current is None:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```
This causes the `self.make_current()` to be executed when `make_current` is `True`, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, we need to change the conditional check and remove the unnecessary calls to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. We can directly check the value of `make_current` and then call `self.make_current()` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current_instance is None:
            self.current_instance = self
    elif make_current:
        if self.current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.current_instance = self
```
In the corrected version, we're using the `self.current_instance` variable instead of calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. This variable represents the current `IOLoop` instance and is used to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` present.

After making this change, the function should now pass the failing test.
