### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop by setting it as the current IOLoop. It takes an optional argument `make_current`, which, if set to `True`, should make the IOLoop the current IOLoop and raise an error if a current IOLoop already exists.

### Identifying potential error locations
The potential error locations in the code are:
1. The `if` condition where it checks if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop already exists.
2. The `elif` condition where it checks if `make_current` is `None` and no current IOLoop exists.

### Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the conditional logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop already exists, the function should raise an error. However, it currently does not handle this case correctly.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditional logic correctly handles the cases where `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop already exists, as well as where `make_current` is `None` and no current IOLoop exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions here...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:  # Correct the condition here
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for the presence of a current IOLoop
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the function, the conditional logic is modified to check if a current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is `True`. If a current IOLoop exists, it raises an error. Otherwise, it proceeds to make the IOLoop the current IOLoop.
