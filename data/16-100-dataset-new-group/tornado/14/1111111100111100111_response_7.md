The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" even when the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is met.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the code checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then immediately raises the `RuntimeError` even if it is `None`.

To fix the bug, we should only raise the `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`. Also, we can simplify the logic of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
