The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the conditional logic for `make_current`. The current logic is checking if `make_current` is None and then trying to make the current IOLoop if it doesn't exist. The problem is that the logic is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is True. It should first check if `make_current` is True, and if so, then try to make the current IOLoop and raise an error if it already exists.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be updated to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    ...

    # the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the `make_current` argument and pass the failing test.
