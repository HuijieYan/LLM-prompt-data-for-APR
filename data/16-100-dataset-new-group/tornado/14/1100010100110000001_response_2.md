The bug in the initialize function is causing a RuntimeError when make_current is set to True. The bug appears to be occurring when make_current is set to True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, which should raise the RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
class IOLoop:
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:  # Checking for True explicitly
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Checking for not None
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the original function, there was an issue with the conditional check for make_current, as well as a logical error in the block that raises the RuntimeError. The corrected version now explicitly checks for `True` and `not None` as intended.
