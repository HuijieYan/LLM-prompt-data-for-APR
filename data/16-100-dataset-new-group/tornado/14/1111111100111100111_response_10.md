The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current `IOLoop` if specified. However, there is a bug in the logic that checks whether a current `IOLoop` already exists, leading to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` and the logic for handling the `make_current` argument.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the conditional check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` is incorrect. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function incorrectly raises a RuntimeError even if a current `IOLoop` does not already exist. This is due to the incorrect conditional check at line 252 of ioloop.py.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` need to be corrected. Additionally, the handling of the `make_current` argument needs to be adjusted to ensure that it correctly sets the current `IOLoop` as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions and class documentation)

    def initialize(self, make_current=False):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks have been adjusted to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and examine the existence of the current `IOLoop`. The logic for raising the RuntimeError has been corrected to accurately reflect whether a current `IOLoop` already exists.
