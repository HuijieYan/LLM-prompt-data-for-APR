### Potential Error Location
The potential error in the buggy function is within the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the misinterpretation of the conditional statements. When `make_current` is True, the function is checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and raising a RuntimeError if it is not None. This contradicts the intention of the code, as it should only raise the error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is True or None. Additionally, we should ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when the appropriate condition is met.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version addresses the issue by updating the conditional check in the elif branch to verify if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before raising the RuntimeError. This alteration ensures that the error is only raised when the expected condition is met.
