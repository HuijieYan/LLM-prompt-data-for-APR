The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is attempting to check for an existing `IOLoop` instance when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. However, at the same time, it's also checking for an existing instance when `make_current` is `None`, and there's an issue in the logic here. 

The error message indicates that when creating a new `IOLoop` with `make_current` set to `True`, it's checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. It correctly identifies that an `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError`. This is due to the initial logic block where it's checking for an existing instance when `make_current` is `None` before checking it again when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix this bug, the logic for checking an existing instance when `make_current` is `None` should be removed. This will ensure that the `IOLoop` attempts to become the current instance only when the `make_current` parameter is explicitly set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the function checks for an existing `IOLoop` instance only when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`. This will fix the bug and ensure that the `IOLoop` is correctly initialized without attempting to become the current instance when it shouldn't.
