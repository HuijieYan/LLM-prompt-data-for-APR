The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` even if the current IOLoop already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly used to check if the current IOLoop already exists. This condition only checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, but it should also check if the current IOLoop instance is already running.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is already running before attempting to create another one.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.initialized():
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By using the `IOLoop.initialized()` method, we can correctly check if the current IOLoop is already running and raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True`.

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
