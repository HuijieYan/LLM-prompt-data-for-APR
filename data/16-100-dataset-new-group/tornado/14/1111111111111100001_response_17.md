The bug in the given initialize function is that it is not correctly checking whether there is already a current IOLoop instance when the make_current parameter is set to True. This is causing the RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance only if make_current is set to True, and then raise the RuntimeError if a current instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass without raising a RuntimeError.
