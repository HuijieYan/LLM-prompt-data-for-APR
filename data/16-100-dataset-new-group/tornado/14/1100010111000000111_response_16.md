The potential error in the buggy function is within the conditional statements where the make_current parameter is checked and then executed.

The bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a RuntimeError even when the current IOLoop instance does not exist.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the logic within the initialize function to correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before raising a RuntimeError. Additionally, the condition to check for the make_current parameter should be adjusted to ensure it is properly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test as mentioned above and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
