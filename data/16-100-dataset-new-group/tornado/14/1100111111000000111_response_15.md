The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is not working as intended and causing a failure in the `test_force_current` test in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`. The issue was reported on GitHub with the title "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" and the detailed description questions why the `initialize` function raises "already exists" when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the conditional check `if make_current is None:` and `elif make_current:`. Here, the `make_current` argument is not being properly validated against the instance of `IOLoop`, leading to incorrect behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not handling the `make_current` argument properly. It is not correctly validating the existing `IOLoop` instance and is not making appropriate calls to `make_current`. This results in incorrect behavior and the failing of the `test_force_current` test.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to properly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that the `IOLoop` instance is created and managed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition checks for `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` have been modified to ensure that the `make_current` argument and the existing `IOLoop` instance are properly validated. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the `test_force_current` test.
