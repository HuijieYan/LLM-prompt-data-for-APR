The cause of the bug is that the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function is not being properly handled. The buggy function checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True` but it doesn't handle the case when `make_current` is `False`.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should handle the case when `make_current` is `False`, and it should call the `make_current` method only if `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        # Handle the case when make_current is False
        pass
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` argument correctly and pass the failing test.
