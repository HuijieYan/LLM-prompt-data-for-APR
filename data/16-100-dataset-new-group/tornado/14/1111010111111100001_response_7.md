The buggy `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class seems to be designed to initialize the `IOLoop` object and make it the current instance if `make_current` is True. However, there is a bug where it is incorrectly handling the case when a current `IOLoop` already exists.

The failing test `test_force_current` attempts to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create another one which should raise a `RuntimeError` because a current `IOLoop` already exists.

The error message indicates that the `initialize` function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` because it believes a current `IOLoop` already exists, even though it should be initializing the current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix this, we can modify the `initialize` function to only check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is True. If a current instance exists, it should raise the `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This change ensures that if `make_current` is True, it checks if a current instance exists before attempting to make the current instance, and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. This should fix the failing test.
