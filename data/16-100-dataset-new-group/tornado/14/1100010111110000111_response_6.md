Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is occurring in the `initialize` function of the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The issue seems to result from the `make_current` parameter not being handled correctly, causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.

The buggy function is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly when it shouldn't. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but the buggy function is not handling it properly.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when it shouldn't, and the GitHub issue also highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of the `initialize` function.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. If `make_current` is `None`, it should only call `self.make_current()` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and pass the failing test. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
