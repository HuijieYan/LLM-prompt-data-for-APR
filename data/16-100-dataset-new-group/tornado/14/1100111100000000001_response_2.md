The buggy function `initialize` is checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance using the `IOLoop.current` function. It also calls the `make_current` function under certain conditions.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. In the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, there is a missing parameter for the `current` function. It should be `IOLoop.current(self, instance=False)` to properly call the function within the class.

2. The logic of the `if make_current is None` and `elif make_current` statements seems incorrect, as it does not cover all possible cases.

The cause of the bug is that the `current` function is being called without the required `self` parameter within the class, leading to potential errors in function execution and evaluation.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be updated as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `current` function is called within the class using `self.current` and the conditions for `make_current` are properly checked. Additionally, the `elif` condition is updated to explicitly check if `make_current` is `True` to cover the case when it's a boolean value.
