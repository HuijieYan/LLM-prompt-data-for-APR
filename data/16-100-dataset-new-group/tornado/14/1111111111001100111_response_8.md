The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logic issue that causes the failing test case `test_force_current` to fail. The problem stems from incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should first check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if not, it should make the current instance. Conversely, if `make_current` is `None`, it should also check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and make the current instance if not.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the `IOLoop.current` call. It incorrectly assumes that if the `IOLoop.current` returns `None`, then it should make the current instance, which causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised where it should not be.

To fix the bug, the function `initialize` should consistently check the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if a current instance already exists. If `make_current` is `None`, it should try to make the current instance only if there is no current instance.

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the buggy function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test case.
