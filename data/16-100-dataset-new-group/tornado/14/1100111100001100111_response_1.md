The buggy function `initialize` has a conditional logic to check if the `make_current` parameter is None or not. Based on the input value, it then calls the `make_current` method and checks if the current IOLoop already exists. However, there are some issues in the logic and implementation of this function.

Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect logic in the conditional statements.
2. Inconsistent use of `IOLoop.current` and `make_current` methods.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is True and the current IOLoop already exists. In this case, the function should raise a `RuntimeError`, but the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the conditional statements to handle all the possible scenarios correctly.
2. Use consistent method calls to check and create the current IOLoop.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statement for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is updated. It now correctly checks if the current instance is not None before raising a `RuntimeError`.
