The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop object, and if `make_current` is provided, it should ensure that the IOLoop object becomes the current instance, raising an error if a current instance already exists.

The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current` to `True` when constructing an IOLoop object. It then checks that attempting to create another IOLoop object with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.

The error occurs because the `initialize` function incorrectly checks for an existing IOLoop instance using the `IOLoop.current` function, which always creates a new instance if `instance=True` when called. This behavior is incorrect and causes the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to change the `IOLoop.current` function to return the current instance if `instance=False` as required. Additionally, the `initialize` function should correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and check if a current IOLoop instance already exists before making itself the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```
