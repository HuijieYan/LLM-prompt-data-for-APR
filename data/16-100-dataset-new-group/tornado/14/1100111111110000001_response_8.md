The buggy function `initialize` has an issue with checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance. When `make_current` is set as `True`, it should check if the current IOLoop instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the buggy function does not handle this case properly, leading to the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should compare against `IOLoop.current(instance=True)` instead of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:  # Compare against IOLoop.current(instance=True)
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:  # Compare against IOLoop.current(instance=True)
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case where the current IOLoop instance already exists, and the failing test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
