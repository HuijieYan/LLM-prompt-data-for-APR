The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module. This function is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance and optionally making it the current instance.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect usage of the `IOLoop.current` method.
2. Incorrect usage of the `self.make_current()` method.

The cause of the bug is that the `IOLoop.current` method is being used with the `instance=False` argument, which is not a valid usage. Additionally, the `self.make_current()` method is being called without proper handling of the case when an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

To fix the bug, a proper check for the current instance of `IOLoop` should be performed using the `IOLoop.current()` method, and then the `make_current` method should be called only if the instance does not already exist.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current()
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `IOLoop.current()` method is used without the `instance` argument, which defaults to `True` to check for the current instance. Depending on the value of `make_current`, the `make_current` method is called if no current instance exists, and an error is raised if a current instance already exists.
