Given the buggy function and its related functions, we can identify the potential error location in the `initialize` function where the condition `if make_current is None:` is checked. This condition is meant to check if the `make_current` parameter is not provided, but it's not working as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the condition is checking for the wrong value. Instead of checking if `make_current` is `None`, it should check if it is `False`. This is because the intention is to call `self.make_current()` only if `make_current` is `None`, or if it is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `if make_current is None:` to `if make_current is False:` to properly check for the absence of the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is False:  # Fix: change the condition to check for False
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function should now work correctly, maintaining the intended behavior when the `make_current` parameter is not provided or is explicitly set to `False`.
