## Analysis
The `initialize` function is supposed to set the IOLoop as the current loop. The `make_current` parameter decides whether to make the IOLoop current, and if it is already current, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The condition for checking if the IOLoop is already current.
2. The logic for setting the IOLoop as current.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic for checking and setting the IOLoop as current. This results in the `initialize` function not properly handling the `make_current` parameter.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditions for checking the current status of the IOLoop and the logic for setting it as the current loop.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
