The potential error location in the buggy function is in the `initialize` method, where the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None, and if it is not None, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists." This is contradictory because if the current instance is not None, then it is supposed to be handled, not raised as an error.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` method needs to be revised to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function properly checks if the current instance exists and then handles the `make_current` parameter accordingly.
