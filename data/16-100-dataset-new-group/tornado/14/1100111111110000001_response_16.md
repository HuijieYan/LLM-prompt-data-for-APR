The bug in the provided code is within the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The issue is that when `make_current` is True, the condition `if make_current is None` is never satisfied, and therefore the code goes into the `elif make_current` block, which then checks if the current instance is None. Since the current instance is not None, it raises the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists".

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # rest of the class remains the same

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this change, the code should correctly handle the `make_current` argument and avoid the RuntimeError.
