The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. The method takes an optional argument `make_current` which determines whether the current IOLoop should be created. 

The issue appears to be with the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function.

The buggy function checks if `make_current` is set to `None`, and if the current IOLoop is None, it calls the `make_current()` function. If `make_current` is true, it checks if the current IOLoop is None and if not, raises a `RuntimeError`.

The bug is caused by incorrect conditionals where `make_current` is not `None`. It should check if the current IOLoop is not `None` and only then raise a `RuntimeError`, instead of the other way around.

To fix the bug, we will reverse the condition in the elif statement to check if the IOLoop is not None before calling `self.make_current()` and modify the conditional statements accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # No need to explicitly check for make_current, since this will be True by default
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None: 
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
