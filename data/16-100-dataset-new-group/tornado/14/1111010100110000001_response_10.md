The bug originates from the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. The issue occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present. In this case, the function should raise an error as the current `IOLoop` already exists, as indicated by the error message.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic inside the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    already_exists = IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None
    if make_current is None:
        if not already_exists:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if already_exists:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In this corrected version, we first check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and store the result in the `already_exists` variable. Then, based on the value of the `make_current` argument, we handle the logic to make the `IOLoop` instance current or raise an error if it already exists. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
