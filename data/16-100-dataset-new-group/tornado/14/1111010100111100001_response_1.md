The buggy function `initialize` is failing with the error message "RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists". This indicates that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not being correctly evaluated.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checking if the current instance of IOLoop does not exist. However, when `make_current=True`, it should be checking if the current instance of IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, the condition inside the `initialize` function needs to be updated to check if the current instance of IOLoop already exists when `make_current=True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function `initialize`:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will check if the current instance of IOLoop already exists when `make_current=True`, and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. This should resolve the failing test case.
