The cause of the bug in the initialize function is that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is incorrect. It should be checking if the current IOLoop instance is not None, instead of checking if it is None. Additionally, the logic for raising an error if the current IOLoop already exists is missing.

To fix the bug in the initialize function, the logic can be modified to properly handle the make_current argument and the existing current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function will properly handle the make_current argument and prevent the creation of multiple current IOLoop instances when make_current is set to True.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
