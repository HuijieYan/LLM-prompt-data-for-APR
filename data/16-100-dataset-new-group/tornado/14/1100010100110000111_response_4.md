### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is intended to initialize the IOLoop and set it as the current IOLoop if `make_current` is `True`. However, the error message and the GitHub issue indicate that the function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, even though it should only raise this error if `make_current=True`.

### Identified Potential Error Location:
The potential error is occurring in the `initialize` function's `if make_current` block, where it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. The function should only check and raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True`, but it is incorrectly raising the error even when `make_current=False`. This is causing the test to fail and the GitHub issue to be raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current=True`. We can do this by modifying the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=False`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable for reusability. Then, we modify the conditional checks to correctly handle the case when `make_current=False`. The conditional logic now checks if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is not already set before raising a `RuntimeError`.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
