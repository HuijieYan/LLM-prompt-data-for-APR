The bug in the provided function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is causing the test to fail and raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". The problem occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and even though current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it still attempts to make the current `IOLoop` again.

The bug is evident from the fact that the function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the logic checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make it the current instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. This should resolve the issue and the failing test.
