The bug is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The bug causes the `make_current` argument to be ineffective and raise a `RuntimeError` even when the `IOLoop` is not already current.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not properly checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. This is evident from the failing test `test_force_current` where the RuntimeError is raised even though the current `IOLoop` doesn't exist.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to properly handle the `make_current` argument and check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False):
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

This fix checks if `make_current` is None and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, then it makes the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is True and there already exists a current `IOLoop`, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This change ensures that the `make_current` argument is properly handled and that the `IOLoop` instance is correctly verified.
