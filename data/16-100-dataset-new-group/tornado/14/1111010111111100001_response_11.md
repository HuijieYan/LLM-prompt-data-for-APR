The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. It should check if the `IOLoop` is already the current one and only set it as the current instance if it is not.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` method to handle the `make_current` parameter properly:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    We use ``epoll`` (Linux) or ``kqueue`` (BSD and Mac OS X) if they
    are available, or else we fall back on select(). If you are
    implementing a system that needs to handle thousands of
    simultaneous connections, you should use a system that supports
    either ``epoll`` or ``kqueue``.
    
    Example usage for a simple TCP server:
    
    .. testcode::
    
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the fixed version, we check if `make_current` is `True` and if the current instance of `IOLoop` already exists. If it does, we raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we set the current instance as before.

This change will ensure that the `initialize` method handles the `make_current` parameter correctly and the provided test case should pass.
