## Analysis
The initialize function is checking the condition for make_current but not handling the case when it is False.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The conditional statement for make_current 
2. The make_current() function call

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case when make_current is False, which can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to add a condition to handle the case when make_current is False, and the make_current() function should only be called when make_current is True.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
