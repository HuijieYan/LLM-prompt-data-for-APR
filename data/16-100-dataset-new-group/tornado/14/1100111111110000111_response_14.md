To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is not provided, and the condition for checking if the current IOLoop is already initialized is incorrect.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other methods)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where `make_current` is `None` or `True`. If `make_current` is `None` or `True`, we check if the current IOLoop is already initialized using `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`. If it is already initialized, we raise a `RuntimeError`. If it is not initialized, we proceed with `self.make_current()` as intended. 

Now, this corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
