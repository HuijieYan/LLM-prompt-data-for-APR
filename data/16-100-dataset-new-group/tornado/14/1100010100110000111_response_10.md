### Bug Analysis
The bug is occurring in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`, which is causing confusion.

### Error Location
The bug seems to be in the logic of checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance, especially when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. This is leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when the current `IOLoop` instance is not present as indicated by `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be modified. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance`. Then, based on the value of `make_current`, we only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and `current_instance` is not `None`. Otherwise, we proceed with setting the current `IOLoop` instance as needed.
