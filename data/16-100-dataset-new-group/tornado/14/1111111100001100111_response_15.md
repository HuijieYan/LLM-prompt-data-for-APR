## Potential Error Location
The issue is likely with the logic inside the `initialize` function where it checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` and whether to make it the current instance or raise an error.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be due to the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is no current instance of `IOLoop` and then makes it the current instance. However, when `make_current` is `True`, it is also checking if there is no current instance of `IOLoop` and then raising an error stating that the current instance already exists. This is contradictory and causing the bug.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be updated to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. It should only raise an error if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
