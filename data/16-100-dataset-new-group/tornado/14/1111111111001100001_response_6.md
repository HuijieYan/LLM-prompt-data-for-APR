The buggy function `initialize` is failing the test because it is not setting the current `IOLoop` instance properly when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`. It should check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise an error if it does.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. We can do this by adding an additional check to see if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if it does, raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the test case should pass as the `initialize` function now correctly handles the case when `make_current` is `True`.
