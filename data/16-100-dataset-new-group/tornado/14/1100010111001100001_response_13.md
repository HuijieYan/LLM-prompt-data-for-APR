The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. The function should only call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is `True` and no current IOLoop instance exists. However, the current implementation also allows `make_current` to be `True` even when a current IOLoop instance already exists, which causes the `RuntimeError` to not be raised as expected in the test.

To fix the bug, the function should only call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is `True` and no current IOLoop instance exists. If a current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, the function should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
