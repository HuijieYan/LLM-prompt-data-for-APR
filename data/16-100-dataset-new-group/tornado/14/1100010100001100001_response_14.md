### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` function seems to occur when `make_current` is True. In this case, the function checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists and if not, it creates a new one. However, the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is None is not working as expected.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is None and create a new one.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
