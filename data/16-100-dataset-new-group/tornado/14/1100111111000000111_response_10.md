## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is not checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance correctly. The logic for checking the current instance and raising a `RuntimeError` is flawed.

## Error Location
The error is in the `initialize` function where the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance is not correctly implemented.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug causes the `initialize` function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when it should not, leading to the failing test `test_force_current`. The issue on GitHub also points out the incorrect behavior, where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None` but the code still attempts to raise "already exists".

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raise a `RuntimeError` only when necessary.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raise a `RuntimeError` if it is not `None` when `make_current` is `None` or `True`. Otherwise, we call `make_current` as before. This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test.
