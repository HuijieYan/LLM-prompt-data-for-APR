Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` does not seem to be handling the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None properly.
2. The `if` condition inside the `else` block may not be handling the check for the existing IOLoop properly.

Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter and the existing IOLoop. In the provided function, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter and the existing IOLoop is not properly implemented. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised when it shouldn't be.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The function should first check if an IOLoop instance already exists. If not, it should then proceed to make the current IOLoop. If an IOLoop instance already exists, it should only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
This corrected version of the function properly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance based on the value of `make_current` and no longer incorrectly raises a RuntimeError based on the initial bug report in the GitHub issue.
