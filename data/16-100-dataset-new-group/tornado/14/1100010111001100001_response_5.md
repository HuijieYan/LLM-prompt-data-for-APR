The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop, but there seems to be an issue with the `make_current` parameter. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an IOLoop and force it to be the current IOLoop instance. If another attempt is made to make a current instance while one already exists, a `RuntimeError` should be raised.

The bug in the function lies in the conditional checks. It does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`. Instead, it checks if the current IOLoop exists and then tries to make it current, but does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly check if the current IOLoop exists and handle the `make_current` parameter appropriately to avoid overwriting the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the conditional check properly ensures that the `make_current` parameter is handled correctly, and the function should pass the failing test.
