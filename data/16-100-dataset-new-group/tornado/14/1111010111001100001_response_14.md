The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance if `make_current` is `True`. However, the logic inside the function has a bug that prevents it from working as expected.

The bug is likely in the `initialize` function, where it checks if `make_current` is `None` before attempting to make the current instance. The logic is incorrect and does not handle the case when `make_current` is `True` correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This leads to the test failing because the function should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should now handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and the failing test should pass.
