The bug in the provided code is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The issue is related to the use of the `make_current` variable and the logic to check if the current instance already exists.

The buggy function tries to initialize an IOLoop instance, and if `make_current` is not provided, it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and creates one if it doesn't. If `make_current` is provided, it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does.

The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if the current instance matches the newly created one.

The error message shows that during the test, the code tries to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, but it raises a RuntimeError because it thinks a current IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug, I would suggest modifying the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, the logic for initializing the IOLoop instance and checking if a current instance exists has been fixed. The `make_current` parameter is now processed correctly, and the check for the current instance is also adjusted. This should resolve the bug and make the `test_force_current` function pass without raising a RuntimeError.
