There are a few potential error locations within the `initialize` function:

1. The `make_current` parameter is not being properly handled when it is `True`.
2. There is a reference to `self.make_current()` but the method `make_current` is not defined within the `IOLoop` class.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and if not, make the current `IOLoop`. However, the function is also trying to call `self.make_current()` which is not defined.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and remove the reference to `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            IOLoop.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        IOLoop.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the incorrect reference to `self.make_current()` and replaced it with a call to `IOLoop.make_current()` when necessary. Additionally, we have added a check to ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance does not already exist when `make_current` is `True`.
