The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not properly handling the `make_current` argument. The function should check if `make_current` is True, and if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError` instead of making the `IOLoop` current again.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` argument properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None and current_instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will properly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that a `RuntimeError` is raised when a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` is attempted.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
