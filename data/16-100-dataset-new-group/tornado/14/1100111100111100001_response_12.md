The bug in the given code is that the `initialize` function is not properly checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the current instance. This results in the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" when a new `IOLoop` instance is initialized with `make_current=True`.

To fix this bug, the initialize function should first check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before trying to make the current instance. If a current instance already exists and make_current is set to True, it should raise a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now properly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the current instance. This will prevent the RuntimeError from being raised when a new instance is initialized with `make_current=True`.
