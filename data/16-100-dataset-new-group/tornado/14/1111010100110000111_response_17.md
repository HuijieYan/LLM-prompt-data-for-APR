Since the error message indicates that the IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, the function is incorrectly raising a RuntimeError for "current IOLoop already exists". This suggests that there is a logical error in the code where the condition for checking if a current IOLoop already exists is not being handled correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the initialize() function to correctly handle the case where IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None. We should only raise a RuntimeError if make_current is True and there is already a current instance. Otherwise, the make_current() method should be called.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize() function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the bug should be fixed. This version of the function will correctly handle the case where IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None or not None and will only raise a RuntimeError when necessary.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
