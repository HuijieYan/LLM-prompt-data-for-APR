The potential error in the `initialize` function is the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument. If `make_current` is `None`, then it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist. If it does not exist, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, then it again checks if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist, and then raises a `RuntimeError` if it does.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current `IOLoop` instance. This is inconsistent with the intended behavior, which is to raise a `RuntimeError` only if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If it does not, it then proceeds to call `self.make_current()`.

With this correction, the function should behave as expected and pass the failing test.
