The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object with a flag `make_current` indicating whether to make the IOLoop current. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then asserts that the current IOLoop is indeed the newly created instance. However, the test fails with a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error in the buggy function is the condition `if make_current:` which checks if `make_current` is True, and then tries to raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current:` does not handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists, resulting in the `RuntimeError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists. We can achieve this by explicitly checking if the current IOLoop exists before attempting to make the IOLoop current.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # Check if current IOLoop does not exist
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Current IOLoop already exists
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop does not exist, then it will make the IOLoop current. If `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists, it will raise a `RuntimeError` as expected.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
