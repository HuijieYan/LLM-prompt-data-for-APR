The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize a new instance of the `IOLoop`. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that there is a discrepancy in the logic of the `initialize` function, particularly around line 252 where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for `None` and then raising an error "current IOLoop already exists".

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the inconsistent logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if so, it attempts to make the current instance. However, when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, it again checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if not, it raises an error. This contradiction in logic leads to the reported issue.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be updated to have consistent logic for checking and making the current `IOLoop` instance. The logic should be adjusted to only attempt to make the current instance if it is not already the current instance, and not raise an error if it is already the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic checks if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance exists, it makes the current instance. If `make_current` is `True` and the current instance does not exist, it raises an error. If `make_current` is `None` and the current instance does not exist, it makes the current instance. This ensures consistent logic and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
