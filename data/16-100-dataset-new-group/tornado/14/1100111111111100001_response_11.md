The buggy function `initialize` is failing because it doesn't correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. The code is supposed to check if a current `IOLoop` already exists, and if not, then it should make the current `IOLoop`. However, the current implementation fails to accurately handle this logic, leading to the RuntimeError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current `IOLoop` is checked properly before attempting to make it the current `IOLoop`. We can do this by directly calling the `current` method of the `IOLoop` class.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test should now pass.
