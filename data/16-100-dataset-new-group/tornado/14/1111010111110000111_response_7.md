The issue is occurring in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class defined in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is throwing a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This error is related to GitHub issue titled "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None", which questions the logic for raising the error.

The cause of the bug is that in the `initialize` function, when `make_current` is `None`, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it should set the `IOLoop` as the current instance. However, instead of making the current instance, it is raising a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to handle the case when `make_current` is `None` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. We should make the current `IOLoop` in that case. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the currently executing `IOLoop` is not overridden when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else: 
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current and current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:  # Ensure only one IOLoop is made current
            self.make_current()
``` 

With these changes, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `None` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and will also prevent overriding the current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True`. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and make the failing test pass.
