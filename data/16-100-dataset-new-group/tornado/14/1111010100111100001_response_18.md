The buggy function `initialize` takes an input parameter `make_current` of type `bool`.

The error message indicates that the function is trying to raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current` should only check whether `make_current` is `True`, not whether the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. This incorrect condition is causing the function to raise the `RuntimeError` when it should not be raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition `if make_current` to `if make_current is True`. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Fix: change the condition to check if make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
