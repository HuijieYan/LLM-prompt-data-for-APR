The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class. The purpose of the function is to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and optionally make it the current `IOLoop` instance.

The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should be `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists.
2. The condition `if make_current is None` should be `if make_current is not None` to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is provided.

The bug in the function is that it does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is provided as `False`. The function only attempts to make the `IOLoop` instance the current instance when `make_current` is `None` or `True`.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance should be corrected and the logic for handling the `make_current` argument should be adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is not None:
        if make_current and current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
    elif current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is not None. If it is not None, we then check if it is True and if a current instance already exists, and raise an error if so. If `make_current` is True and no current instance exists, we make the current instance. If `make_current` is None, we check if a current instance exists and make it the current instance if not.
