Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file arises from the logic of checking the current instance of the `IOLoop`. The issue seems to be that the logic for checking whether the current `IOLoop` exists or not is incorrect, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised when it should not.

To fix this, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly check whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists and only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the logic inside the `elif make_current` block has been modified to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, indicating that a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

With this correction, the `initialize` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
