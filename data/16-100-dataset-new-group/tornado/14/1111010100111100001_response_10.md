The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, then it should raise a `RuntimeError` to indicate that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If such an instance does exist, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If no current instance exists, it proceeds to make the current `IOLoop` instance.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and pass the failing tests.
