## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In the buggy function, the bug is caused by the inconsistency in the condition checks and error raising logic. The existing logic checks for None value, but the error is raised for a different condition, thus leading to inconsistencies in the behavior of the function.

The corrected version of the function now includes proper condition checks and consistent error raising logic according to the requirements specified in the description. The condition checks for both cases (when `make_current` is None and when it is True) have been updated, and the error raising logic has been modified accordingly.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
