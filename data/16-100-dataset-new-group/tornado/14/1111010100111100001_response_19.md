The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current IOLoop, and it takes a parameter `make_current` of type boolean to control its behavior.

The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function is trying to raise a `RuntimeError` because it believes that the current IOLoop already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly evaluating whether the current IOLoop instance exists. When `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current IOLoop without checking if it already exists.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to only set the current IOLoop if `make_current` is `True`, without checking if it already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

This revised function checks if `make_current` is `True`, and only then sets the current IOLoop instance without checking if it already exists.
