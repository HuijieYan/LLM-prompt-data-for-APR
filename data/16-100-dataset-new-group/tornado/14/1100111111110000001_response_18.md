The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` from the file `tornado/ioloop.py` is failing the test case `test_force_current` in the file `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` with the error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`. 

The cause of this bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` parameter is provided. It should first check if a current IOLoop already exists before setting a new one, but the current logic is not properly checking for this, which results in the `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is provided. It should check if a current IOLoop already exists and throw a `RuntimeError` if it does.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will properly handle the case when `make_current` is provided, and it should pass the failing test.
