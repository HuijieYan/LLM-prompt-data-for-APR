The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists and create one if it doesn't. However, the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` appears to be causing confusion, as it is not clear whether to raise an error or make the current IOLoop instance.

To fix this bug, the conditional statements in the `initialize` function need to be revised to ensure that the correct action is taken based on whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not.

Revised function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the current IOLoop instance is stored in the variable `current_instance` to avoid calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` multiple times. The conditional statements are also revised to correctly handle cases where the current IOLoop instance exists or not, ensuring that the appropriate action is taken in each scenario.
