The bug in the provided function is that it does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. The function is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance is already the current instance, and if not, make the new IOLoop instance the current one. However, the current implementation is not handling this case correctly.

The bug is causing the failing test to raise a RuntimeError, indicating that the "current IOLoop already exists" when attempting to initialize a new IOLoop with `make_current=True`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance, resulting in the RuntimeError being incorrectly raised.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. This can be done by checking if there is already a current IOLoop instance before attempting to make the new instance the current one.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
