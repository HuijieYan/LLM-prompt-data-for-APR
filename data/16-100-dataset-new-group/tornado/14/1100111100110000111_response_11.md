## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. It checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and if not, it calls the `make_current` method to make it the current `IOLoop`. The bug causes a `RuntimeError` to be raised erroneously.

The error message indicates that the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` call is returning `None`, but the code is still raising a `RuntimeError` for an existing `IOLoop`. This means that the logic in the `initialize` method is faulty.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `initialize` method. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should not raise a `RuntimeError` because it actually indicates that an `IOLoop` doesn't already exist, contrary to the erroneous behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case where an `IOLoop` instance doesn't exist.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        # Check if make_current is None and IOLoop does not already exist
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        # Check if make_current is True and IOLoop does not already exist
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the corrected version, the `initialize` method no longer raises a `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. Instead, it will correctly call `self.make_current()` in that case. If `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` already exists, it will raise the `RuntimeError` as intended.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
