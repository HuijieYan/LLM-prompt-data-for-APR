The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is causing a RuntimeError to be raised when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The conditional statement `if make_current is None` and `elif make_current` seems to be causing the issue.
2. The use of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if the current IOLoop already exists might not be functioning as intended.

The cause of the bug is as follows:
1. When `make_current` is True, the buggy function checks if the current IOLoop exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it exists, it raises a RuntimeError, indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.
2. However, the check for the current IOLoop's existence using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not working correctly, leading to an incorrect RuntimeError being raised.

To fix the bug, a potential strategy is to refactor the logic for checking the current IOLoop's existence and whether to create a new one based on the value of `make_current`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the function first captures the current instance of IOLoop using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then, it checks the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current IOLoop based on the captured current_instance variable. If `make_current` is True and the current_instance exists, it raises a RuntimeError. Otherwise, it creates a new IOLoop instance.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub and pass the failing test.
