The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, but it is failing due to an error in the conditional logic. The error message indicates that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is not working as expected.

The problem lies in the conditional logic for checking if the current IOLoop already exists. The bug is present in the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class.

The issue arises from the conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` followed by the `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")`. The intention seems to be to check if an instance of IOLoop already exists and then raise an error if it does. However, the condition is incorrectly structured, resulting in the error being raised when it shouldn't.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic to accurately check if the current IOLoop instance exists and then raise the error if it does.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # other functions in the IOLoop class

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the conditional logic checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and raises an error if it does, otherwise it proceeds with the initialization. This should fix the bug and the failing test.
