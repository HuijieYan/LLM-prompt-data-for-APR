The problem with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is that it is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is supposed to set the current IOLoop instance, but it is not doing so properly.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the function is not setting the current IOLoop instance correctly. This is causing the test `test_force_current` to fail, as it expects the `initialize` function to correctly set the current IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` parameter properly and ensure that it sets the current IOLoop instance correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now correctly set the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`. The failing test should pass with this correction.
