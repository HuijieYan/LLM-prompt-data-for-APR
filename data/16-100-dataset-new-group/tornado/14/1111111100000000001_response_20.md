## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    """Initializes the IOLoop.

    Args:
        make_current: If True, the new IOLoop will always try to become
                      current and will raise an error if there is already
                      a current instance. If False, the new IOLoop will
                      not try to become current. Default is True.
    """
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original code is related to the logic of the `initialize` function. The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop with an option to make it the current IOLoop if there isn't already a current instance. However, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument is flawed.

In the original code, if `make_current` is not provided, the function will try to make the IOLoop current only if there is no current instance. This logic is unnecessary and can lead to unexpected behavior.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to simplify the logic in the `initialize` function and explicitly handle the cases where `make_current` is True or False. Also, the default value for `make_current` should be set to True to align with the intended behavior of making the IOLoop current by default.

The corrected version of the function provided above fixes the bug by simplifying the logic and explicitly handling the cases where `make_current` is True or False. Now the function will correctly initialize the IOLoop and attempt to make it current based on the value of the `make_current` argument.
