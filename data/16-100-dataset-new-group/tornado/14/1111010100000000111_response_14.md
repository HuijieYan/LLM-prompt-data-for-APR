Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The logic for checking the current instance of IOLoop is not well-implemented.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect checking of the current instance of IOLoop. The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and potentially make it the current instance. However, the logic for checking the current instance is flawed, leading to the incorrect raising of a RuntimeError.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the logic for checking the current instance of IOLoop in the `initialize` function to ensure it functions as intended.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
