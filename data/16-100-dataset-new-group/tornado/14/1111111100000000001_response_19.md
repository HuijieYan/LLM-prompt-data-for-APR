The bug in the `initialize` function is that it compares the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to `None` when it should be comparing it to `self`. The purpose of this function is to ensure that the current IOLoop is the one being initialized, and it should check if the current IOLoop is the same instance as `self`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self`. This will check if the current IOLoop is not the same as the instance being initialized, and then we can make it the current IOLoop using `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
