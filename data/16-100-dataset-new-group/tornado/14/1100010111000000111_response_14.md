The bug in the "initialize" function seems to be causing the "test_force_current" test to fail. The purpose of the test is to verify that a RuntimeError is raised when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with make_current=True if one already exists.

Upon analyzing the "initialize" function, it seems that the bug is in the logic used to check if there is already a current IOLoop instance. When make_current is True, it should raise a RuntimeError if there is already a current IOLoop instance. However, the current logic seems to be flawed, leading to the incorrect behavior in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance needs to be revised. One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to explicitly check if there is already a current IOLoop instance before attempting to make the current IOLoop. If a current instance already exists and make_current is True, then a RuntimeError should be raised.

Here's the corrected version of the "initialize" function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the "test_force_current" should pass, and the issue posted in GitHub should be resolved.
