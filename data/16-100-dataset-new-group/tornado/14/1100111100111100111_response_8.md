Based on the provided information, the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists is incorrect. The code attempts to check if an IOLoop instance already exists by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and then raising a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, due to the incorrect condition, the `RuntimeError` is being raised erroneously.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, I have changed the condition in the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None when `make_current` is True. This ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is True.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub ticket and resolve the failing test case.
