### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to initialize the IOLoop by setting it as the current IOLoop if it is not already set. However, there are potential issues with the conditionals and the logic used to initialize the IOLoop.

### Bugs
1. The conditional statement for `make_current` is not handling the case when `make_current` is `True`.
2. The function is not correctly handling the case when the IOLoop is already set as the current IOLoop.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the mishandling of the `make_current` parameter and the incorrect checking for the current IOLoop.

### Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the conditional statements to handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.
2. Correctly check if the current IOLoop already exists and handle it accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
