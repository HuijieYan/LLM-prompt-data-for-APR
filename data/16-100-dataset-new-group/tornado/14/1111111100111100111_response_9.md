### Bug analysis
The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should raise an error if the current `IOLoop` already exists. However, due to the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, the error is being raised incorrectly.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Incorrect condition statement in the if-else block for `make_current`.

The cause of the bug:
The bug causes the function to raise a `RuntimeError` even when the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True`.
2. Use a proper condition to ensure the correct behavior of the function.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated the condition to check for the existence of current IOLoop
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
