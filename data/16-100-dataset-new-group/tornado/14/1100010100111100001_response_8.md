The buggy function `initialize` is failing to properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. The function is supposed to check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the check is not functioning correctly and the error message "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised when `make_current` is set to `True`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and correctly check if the current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make it the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # fixed the condition to properly check if make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # fixed the check to see if the current IOLoop exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test.
