The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly, leading to a RuntimeError when trying to force the current IOLoop.

The bug occurs because when `make_current` is not provided, the code inside `initialize` function attempts to call `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` without first setting the instance as current.

To fix the bug, the code should check if `make_current` is True and then set the instance as current before attempting to call `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly check if the IOLoop instance is already set as current before attempting to do so and will raise an error accordingly.

This corrected version should resolve the RuntimeError and pass the failing test.
