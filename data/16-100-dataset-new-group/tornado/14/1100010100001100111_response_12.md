## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the current IOLoop. It checks if the current IOLoop already exists and then either makes it the current one or raises an error. The issue on GitHub is questioning why the error is being raised even when the current IOLoop is set to None.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might not be functioning correctly.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current IOLoop's existence. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not working as expected, leading to the erroneous behavior when raising the "already exists" error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop and the handling of the `make_current` parameter. We also need to ensure that the condition for raising the "already exists" error is correctly evaluated.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have revised the condition for raising the error to check if the current IOLoop is not None when `make_current` is True. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as intended.
