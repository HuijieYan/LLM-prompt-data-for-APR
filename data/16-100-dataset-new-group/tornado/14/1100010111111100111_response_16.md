### Bug Explanation
The issue seems to be with the conditional check in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the current implementation is not handling this condition correctly and is raising the error incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Update the conditional check for `make_current=True` to properly handle the case when the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. Ensure that the function behaves as expected for different values of `make_current`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks for `make_current=True` have been updated to correctly handle the case when the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This should resolve the issue and make the function behave as expected.
