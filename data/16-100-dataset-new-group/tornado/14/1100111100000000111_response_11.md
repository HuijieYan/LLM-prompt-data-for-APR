## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original code is that it checks for None in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and then raises an error if it is not None in the `elif` condition. This logic is contradictory and causes the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.

To fix the bug, we can make the following changes:
1. Replace `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` with `self.current(instance=False)` to correctly call the `current` method within the IOLoop class.
2. Change the condition in the `elif` statement to check if `self.current(instance=False)` is not None, and then raise an error if it is not None.

By making these changes, the bug should be resolved, and the function should work as intended based on the given GitHub issue.
