The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True` and if there is no current `IOLoop` instance already. However, there are issues with the logic in the function that need to be addressed.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditions that check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and in the logic of setting the current `IOLoop`.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. Specifically, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not being properly handled. This condition is intended to check if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, but it is not working as expected, leading to the incorrect behavior in the function.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be revised. Additionally, the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True` should be improved to ensure that it behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the variable `current_instance` and then use this variable to check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The logic for setting the current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True` is also updated to make the function behave as expected.

By using this corrected version, the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
