## Potential Error Locations:
The bug could be located in the `initialize` function, specifically in the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current `IOLoop`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the code incorrectly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if it finds that it already exists, which contradicts the intended behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `initialize` function need to be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` argument. Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be adjusted to align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the `initialize` function addresses the issues by properly checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument. This version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
