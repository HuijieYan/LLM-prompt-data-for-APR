The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop object and optionally make it the current instance. However, the bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists, causing a RuntimeError to be raised.

The bug is caused by the conditional statement in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should first check if a current IOLoop instance exists. If it does, the function should raise a RuntimeError. However, the current implementation incorrectly checks for the absence of a current IOLoop instance and only raises the RuntimeError if it is not found, causing the bug.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `initialize` function need to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that when `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance exists, a RuntimeError is raised as intended.
