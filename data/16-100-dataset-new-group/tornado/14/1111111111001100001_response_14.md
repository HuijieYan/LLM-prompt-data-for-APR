The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not correctly checking whether the `IOLoop` instance is already the current one before attempting to make it the current one. This leads to the `RuntimeError` not being raised when it should be, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should check if the `IOLoop` instance is already the current one before attempting to make it the current one.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:  # Check if the current instance is not the same as the current one
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `RuntimeError` will be raised if the current `IOLoop` instance is already the same as the current one, and the test should pass.
