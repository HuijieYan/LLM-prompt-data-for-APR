The buggy function is the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. It is used to initialize the `IOLoop` instance, and it accepts a boolean argument `make_current` which controls whether the new `IOLoop` should become the current instance or not.

The reason for the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` method incorrectly handles the case when `make_current` is `True` or `None`, which results in the failing test.

The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and then attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance with the same argument. The second creation should raise a `RuntimeError` because a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. 

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` method needs to be corrected to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` or `None`, and raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other methods and class attributes)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the `initialize` method now correctly handles the `make_current` argument and should pass the failing test.
