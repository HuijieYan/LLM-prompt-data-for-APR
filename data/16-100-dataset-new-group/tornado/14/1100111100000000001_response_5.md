The problem with the buggy function is that it is using the same name "make_current" as a parameter and as a method within the class. This can lead to confusion and potential errors.

To fix the bug, the parameter "make_current" should be renamed to something else, and the method "make_current" within the class should be called without using the "self" parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, set_as_current=None):
        if set_as_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif set_as_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected function, the parameter "make_current" has been renamed to "set_as_current" to avoid confusion with the method name. And inside the function, the method "make_current" is called using "self.make_current()" without passing it as a parameter.
