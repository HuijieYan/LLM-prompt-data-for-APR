The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the `make_current` argument. The `initialize` function should set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is True or if it is not provided and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. However, the current implementation is not checking the condition correctly, resulting in the test failure.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to appropriately handle the `make_current` argument.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should correctly handle the `make_current` argument and pass the failing test.
