The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is meant to initialize the current IOLoop with the option to force it to become the current IOLoop. However, the bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` even when the IOLoop already exists.

The cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the logic within the `initialize` function where it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None regardless of the value of the `make_current` parameter. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when the IOLoop already exists, as seen in the failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the logic within the `initialize` function needs to be modified. It should check the value of the `make_current` parameter and decide whether to initialize the IOLoop based on that value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other functions and class declarations

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `initialize` function now checks the value of the `make_current` parameter before making decisions about whether to initialize the IOLoop and whether to raise a `RuntimeError`. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
