The buggy function is the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class from the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. This method is part of the `IOLoop` class and is also called from the `EPollIOLoop` class.

The bug is in the `initialize` function where the behavior of the `make_current` argument is not consistent with the expectations outlined in the comments of the `IOLoop` class docstring. The behavior of this function falls short of the expected behavior as described in the comments.

The issue arises because the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is supposed to control the current `IOLoop`. However, the behavior of the function causes an error where the current `IOLoop` is already existing but the code is structured to create a new instance as the current `IOLoop`.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` method needs to be modified to align with the expected behavior described in the comments of the `IOLoop` class docstring. The `make_current` argument, when `True`, should always try to set the new `IOLoop` as the current one and raise an error if there is already an existing current instance. However, if `False`, the new `IOLoop` should not try to become the current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With the corrected changes in the `initialize` method, the failing test should pass as expected.
