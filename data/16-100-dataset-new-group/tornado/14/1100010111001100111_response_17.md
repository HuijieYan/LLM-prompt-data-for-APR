## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# this is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditions and raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, we can fix the bug in the `initialize` function. This corrected version of the function should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test provided.
