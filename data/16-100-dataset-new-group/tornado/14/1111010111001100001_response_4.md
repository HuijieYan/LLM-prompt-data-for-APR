The buggy function has a logical error in the `initialize` method where it is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The bug causes the `make_current` parameter to not be set correctly to the current `IOLoop` instance, leading to the failing test.

The function should check if `make_current` is set to `True` and then make the current `IOLoop` instance, or raise an error if there is already a current instance. If `make_current` is not provided, the function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, make the current instance.

Based on the failing test, it appears that the `IOLoop` constructor is not correctly assigning the current instance when `make_current=True`. Additionally, it does not raise an error when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance when one already exists.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure the current `IOLoop` instance is set or raised an error if it already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
