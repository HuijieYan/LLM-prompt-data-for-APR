Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `initialize` function of `tornado/ioloop.py` is related to the logic around the `make_current` parameter. The `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is failing due to the incorrect behavior of `initialize` when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The bug arises from the logic inside the `initialize` function's conditional statements. The function should correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

The GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" indicates that the behavior of the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` at line 252 is not producing the expected outcome when checking for the existence of an IOLoop instance. This issue aligns with the failing test case, where the RuntimeError is not being raised as expected when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists. It should raise a RuntimeError in this scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test case. Additionally, it resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
