The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop, and it takes an optional parameter `make_current`. Based on the provided information and the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be with the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` inside the function. The issue mentions that the condition is returning `None`, but then the code is raising a "current IOLoop already exists" error, which is contradictory.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the conditional checks for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` are not handling the case where the current IOLoop instance is already present properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks and handling of the `make_current` parameter. In the case where `make_current` is `True`, we need to check if the current IOLoop instance is already present and raise an error if it is. If `make_current` is not specified, the code should make the IOLoop current if there isn't already a current instance.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` is used to check if the current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to make it current.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the intended logic.
