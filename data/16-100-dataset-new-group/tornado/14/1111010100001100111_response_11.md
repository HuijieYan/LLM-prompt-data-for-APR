The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is related to the conditional checks for the `make_current` parameter and the current instance of `IOLoop`. The bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when it should not.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The conditional check for `make_current` and the current instance of `IOLoop`.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

The cause of the bug is as follows:
- The `initialize` function is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance if required.
- However, the conditional checks for `make_current` and the current instance of `IOLoop` are not correctly handling the cases where `make_current` is `True` or `None`.
- This leads to incorrect behavior and the function may raise a `RuntimeError` even when it is not necessary.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter need to be adjusted to correctly determine when to make the `IOLoop` instance current and when to raise an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current and current_instance is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    
    if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic is adjusted to first check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`, in which case a `RuntimeError` is raised. Then, if `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance, the function makes the `IOLoop` instance current. This ensures that the behavior aligns with the intended functionality of the `initialize` function and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
