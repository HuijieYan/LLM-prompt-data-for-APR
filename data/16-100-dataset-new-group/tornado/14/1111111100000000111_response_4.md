The bug in the `initialize` function seems to be related to the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue posted on GitHub indicates that at line 252, the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`, and it is unclear why an error is being raised for "current IOLoop already exists".

The potential error locations within the `initialize` function are:
1. The conditional statement for `make_current` is not handling the case when `make_current` is set to `False`.
2. There is some confusion in the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

The cause of the bug is due to the improper handling of the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `False`, the code is not properly handling this case, and hence the confusion.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument needs to be adjusted, and the conditional checks for the current `IOLoop` instance should be reviewed.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first retrieve the current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then, based on the value of `make_current`, we check if the current instance exists and handle the case accordingly. This ensures that the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is handled properly for both cases of `make_current`.
