The buggy initialize function is failing the test, indicating that it is not correctly handling the make_current argument and is raising a RuntimeError when it should not. Upon analysis, the root cause of this bug is that the code is not properly checking whether an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one. 

To fix this bug, we should modify the code to only attempt to create a new IOLoop instance if the current one does not already exist when make_current is set to True. If make_current is set to None, the function should proceed with the logic of the existing code.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # fixed the condition for make_current
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # check if a current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the code should now pass the failing test and correctly handle the make_current argument.
