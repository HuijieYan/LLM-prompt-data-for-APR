The cause of the bug in the initialize function of the IOLoop class is that it does not handle the make_current parameter correctly. When make_current is True, the function should check if an IOLoop instance already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. However, the current implementation is not checking this condition properly.

To fix this bug, the initialize function should be modified to properly handle the make_current parameter and check for the existence of an IOLoop instance before creating a new one.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the initialize function will now correctly check for the existence of an IOLoop instance when make_current is True and raise a RuntimeError if one already exists.

This should address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
