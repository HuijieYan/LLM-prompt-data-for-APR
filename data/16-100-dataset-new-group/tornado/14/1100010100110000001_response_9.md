### Analysis
The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised when the `make_current` flag is set to True. This means that the existing current IOLoop instance is not being properly handled or checked.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error location within the `initialize` function is in the `elif make_current` block where it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the improper handling of the current IOLoop instance. The conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop is not working as intended, leading to the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the check for the current IOLoop instance is accurate and that the `make_current` flag is being handled appropriately. We can modify the conditional block to properly handle these cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current IOLoop instance in a variable `current_instance`. Then, we modify the conditional block to use this variable for the checks. This should correctly handle the current IOLoop instance and the `make_current` flag.
