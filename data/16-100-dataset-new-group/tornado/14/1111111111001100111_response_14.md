The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the current IOLoop, but the logic for handling the `make_current` argument is incorrect. It checks if the current IOLoop exists and then decides whether to make the new IOLoop instance the current one or raise an error. However, the logic is flawed because it doesn't properly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True`.

The failing test `test_force_current` intends to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then confirm that calling `IOLoop.current()` returns the newly created instance. The test also checks to ensure that attempting to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The bug occurs because in the `initialize` function, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument leads to the new IOLoop instance not being made the current one when `make_current=True`. This results in the `IOLoop.current()` call returning the old instance instead of the new one, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be updated. It should always make the new IOLoop instance the current one when `make_current` is set to `True`, and raise an error if there already is a current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will properly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that the new IOLoop instance becomes the current one when `make_current=True`. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
