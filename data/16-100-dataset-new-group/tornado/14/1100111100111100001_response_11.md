The buggy function has a conditional statement that checks the value of `make_current` and raises a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop already exists.

The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is always `False` due to the `instance=False` argument, which prevents the function from correctly checking if a current IOLoop exists.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to correctly check if a current IOLoop exists, regardless of the `instance` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current() is None:` checks if a current IOLoop exists, and `if IOLoop.current() is not None:` checks if a current IOLoop does not exist when `make_current` is `True`. These conditions correctly handle the initialization of the IOLoop.
