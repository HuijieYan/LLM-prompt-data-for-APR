The potential error in the `initialize` function is that when `make_current` is `None`, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then calls `self.make_current()`. But in the failing test `test_force_current`, the expectation is that a second `make_current=True` construction should raise a `RuntimeError`, but instead, it is not raising that error.

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` already exists.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, it should pass the failing test `test_force_current` and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
