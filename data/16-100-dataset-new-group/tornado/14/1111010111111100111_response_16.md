## Fixing the Bug
The issue arises from the logic in the `initialize` function, particularly in the condition where it checks if a current `IOLoop` already exists. The bug is causing the function to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True`, even if no current `IOLoop` exists.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when a current `IOLoop` already exists. We will also modify the logic to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` exists without raising a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if not current_instance:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self = current_instance
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is `None` and if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, we set the current instance using `self.make_current()`. Then, if `make_current` is `True`, we check if a current instance exists. If it does, we simply assign the current instance to `self` without raising a `RuntimeError`.

With these changes, the function addresses the issue reported and should pass the failing test.
