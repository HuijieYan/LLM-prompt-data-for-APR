The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The bug is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop and handling the `make_current` argument is flawed. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it is checking if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if it does, it raises an error. However, the intended behavior should be to replace the current IOLoop instance with the one being created.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument needs to be updated in the `initialize` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if existing_instance is not None:
            io_loop = IOLoop()
            io_loop.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument has been updated to check if the current instance exists. If it does, a new instance of IOLoop is created and is set as the current instance. If the current instance does not exist, the method continues to make the current instance the new one.
