## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By using the corrected version of the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass.
