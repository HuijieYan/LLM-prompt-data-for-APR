The buggy function "initialize" in the IOLoop class is intended to initialize the IOLoop object and make it the current IOLoop if the 'make_current' parameter is set to True. However, the bug occurs because the condition to check if an IOLoop is already current is incorrect.

The bug occurs in the 'initialize' function where the check for the current IOLoop is done using 'IOLoop.current(instance=False)'. This check should be using 'IOLoop.current()'.

To fix the bug, the condition in the 'initialize' function needs to be updated to correctly check whether an IOLoop is already current. Additionally, the 'make_current' argument should only be used during the initialization of the IOLoop and not during the checks for the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current()

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the 'initialize' function should no longer have the bug and pass the failing test.
