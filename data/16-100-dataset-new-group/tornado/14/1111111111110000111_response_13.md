# Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    # Check if the IOLoop instance already exists
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        if make_current:
            # If the IOLoop instance already exists and make_current is True, raise an error
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            # If the IOLoop instance already exists and make_current is None, do nothing
            pass
    else:
        if make_current:
            # If the IOLoop instance does not exist and make_current is True, set it as the current IOLoop
            self.make_current()
        else:
            # If the IOLoop instance does not exist and make_current is None, do nothing
            pass
```

Explanation:
- The bug in the original function is that it checks if the IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it attempts to set it as the current IOLoop. However, if the instance is not None, it still attempts to set it as the current IOLoop, leading to the error message in the failing test.
- The corrected version of the function first checks if the IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, it only sets it as the current IOLoop if `make_current` is True, otherwise, it raises an error. If the IOLoop instance does not exist, it only sets it as the current IOLoop if `make_current` is True, otherwise, it does nothing.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
