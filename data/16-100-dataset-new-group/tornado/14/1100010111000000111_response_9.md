def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

### Explanation:
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not checking the correct condition to raise the `RuntimeError`. The `initialize` function was incorrectly checking if the return value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and then raising an error based on that condition. However, the bug is that the condition should be checking if the return value is not None, and then raise the error. The given test function `test_force_current` was failing because the buggy function was not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the condition within the `initialize` function to check if the return value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, and then raise the `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True`. This will ensure that the error is only raised when the current IOLoop instance already exists.

By making this change, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test function `test_force_current`.

The corrected version of the function is provided above.
