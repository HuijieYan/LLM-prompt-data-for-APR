The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the `make_current` input parameter. The logic inside the function is not correctly checking the condition for `make_current`.

The cause of the bug is that the `make_current` input parameter is not being processed correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` input parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we are now using the `self.current` function from the same class to check the current instance, and the logic has been adjusted to properly handle the `make_current` input parameter.
