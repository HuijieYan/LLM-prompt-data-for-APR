### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` that "current IOLoop already exists", even though it should not exist.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    has_current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None
    if make_current is None and not has_current_instance:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and has_current_instance:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current and not has_current_instance:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check if there is a current instance. If `make_current` is None and there is no current instance, we make the current instance. If `make_current` is True and there is a current instance, we raise the `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is True and there is no current instance, we make the current instance. This corrected logic ensures that the function works as intended.

By applying the corrected version, the failing test should pass and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
