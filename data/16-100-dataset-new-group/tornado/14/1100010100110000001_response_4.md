The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists, and if not, raises a RuntimeError. However, the logic is causing the error because it's incorrectly checking for the existence of the IOLoop instance.

To fix this bug, we should check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `False`, and if it does not exist, then raise a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the function should work correctly and pass the failing test.
