The issue here is that the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly. It checks if `make_current` is not provided, then it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and calls `make_current` if it is. However, if `make_current` is provided and True, it also checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and raises a `RuntimeError` if it is not None. This goes against the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, where the `RuntimeError` should only be raised if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic to only check if the current `IOLoop` instance is None when `make_current` is True. Otherwise, we should always call `make_current` regardless.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will always call `make_current` if `make_current` is not provided, and it will only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is not None.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and the failing test case.
