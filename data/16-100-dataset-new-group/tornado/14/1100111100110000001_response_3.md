The bug in the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is that it is calling `IOLoop.current` with the parameter `instance=False` which is invalid syntax and is causing the function to always return `None`, leading to the "current IOLoop already exists" error.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `instance` parameter from the calls to `IOLoop.current` and `make_current` and just call them without any parameters, as they are not needed in this context.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass without the "current IOLoop already exists" error.
