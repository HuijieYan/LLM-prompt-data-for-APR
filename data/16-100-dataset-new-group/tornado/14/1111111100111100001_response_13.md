The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class. The primary issue occurs in the conditional block for the `make_current` parameter. 

The bug is caused by an incorrect check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is True. The bug is triggered when attempting to create a new instance of `IOLoop` with the `make_current` parameter set to `True`, causing the buggy function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` stating that a current `IOLoop` already exists, even if it does not. This is due to the incorrect conditional check and logic in the `initialize` function.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks in the `initialize` function need to be revised to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True. Additionally, the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` should be adjusted to accurately determine whether a current `IOLoop` already exists.

The corrected version of the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` has been modified to accurately check whether a current `IOLoop` exists when `make_current` is True.

This should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
