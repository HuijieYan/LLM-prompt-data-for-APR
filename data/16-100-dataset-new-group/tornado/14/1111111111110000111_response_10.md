The bug within the `initialize` function is causing it to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True`. This is happening because even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, the function mistakenly raises the error "current IOLoop already exists".

The buggy function needs to be fixed by updating the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` has been fixed to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None when `make_current=True`. This aligns with the intended logic of the function, and the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
