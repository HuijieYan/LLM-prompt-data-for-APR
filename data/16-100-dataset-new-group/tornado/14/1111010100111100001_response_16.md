The issue is with the initialize function in the IOLoop class. The purpose of the initialize function is to set the IOLoop instance to be the current one, unless there is already a current instance and the make_current parameter is set to False.

The bug occurs when the make_current parameter is set to True, and there is already a current IOLoop instance. In this case, the function should raise a RuntimeError, but it is currently not doing so, which causes the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check in the initialize function to correctly handle the make_current parameter and the existing current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function checks if make_current is True and there is already a current instance. If both conditions are met, it raises the RuntimeError as expected, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
