The issue in the buggy function is with the logic to check for an existing IOLoop instance when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. The function should check if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if so, raise an error. However, the logic seems to be flawed and is not working as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional check of `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is checking if there is no current instance of IOLoop, and then trying to make the current IOLoop, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to correctly verify the presence of an existing IOLoop instance and only then make it current.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
            return
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is None, and if so, we check if there is no current instance of IOLoop, then make it current. Otherwise, if `make_current` is True, we check if there is already an existing current IOLoop instance, and if so, raise a RuntimeError. If not, we make the current IOLoop.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
