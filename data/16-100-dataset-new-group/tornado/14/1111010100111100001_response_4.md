The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function does not check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to make it the current instance. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to first check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and only then try to make it the current instance. If a current instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, then instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, we should just return without doing anything.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will first check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make it the current instance if `make_current` is `True`. It will avoid raising a `RuntimeError` when a current instance already exists.
