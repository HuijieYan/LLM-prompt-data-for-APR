The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional statements for checking `make_current`.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then proceeds to raise a `RuntimeError` if it is not `None`. This is contradictory logic and leads to the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to accurately handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes, the function now correctly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and proceeds accordingly based on the value of `make_current`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
