The buggy function `initialize` attempts to initialize the IOLoop object with a specification to make it the current instance, if one does not already exist. However, this approach uses a conditional check that causes an unintended behavior upon construction, leading to a RuntimeError during the test. 

The strategy for fixing the bug involves avoiding the inadvertent import of the same function from another class when calling `IOLoop.current()` and ensuring that the specified make_current flag is correctly evaluated to address the condition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

The above adjustments check for the boolean condition when specifying `make_current`, preventing the RuntimeError issue from occurring during the failing test.
