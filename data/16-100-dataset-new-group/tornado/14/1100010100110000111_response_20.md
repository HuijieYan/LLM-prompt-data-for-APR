### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with corresponding error message and the GitHub issue

The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is intended to initialize the IOLoop with an optional parameter `make_current`. The error message from the failing test indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function raises a `RuntimeError` even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which is contradictory.

The GitHub issue highlights the specific line (252) in the `ioloop.py` file and questions why the `RuntimeError` is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function

Potential error locations within the `initialize` function could be the conditional statements that check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Cause of the bug

The bug is caused by the conditional statement for checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. This check is not functioning as intended or it is not being bypassed correctly when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition for checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` behaves as expected, and that it does not raise a `RuntimeError` incorrectly.

### The corrected version

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # checking if IOLoop.current is None
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # checking if IOLoop.current is not None
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the second conditional statement checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`. This ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when an IOLoop instance already exists.
