### Analysis
The `initialize` function is supposed to set the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't already exist. However, the function fails to do so when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, checks if it's the current instance, then attempts to create another instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the test fails, indicating that the second instance is created successfully.

### Bug
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly handles the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. It doesn't properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before creating a new one.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. We should check if the current instance already exists before creating a new one and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
