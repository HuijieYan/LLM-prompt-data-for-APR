### Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then raises an error if `make_current` is `True`. This is contradictory because if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it means there is no current IOLoop, so it should not raise an error for trying to make a new IOLoop current.

### Bug location:
The issue is located in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the condition where it checks for the existence of a current IOLoop and then tries to make it current again.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case where there is no current IOLoop differently from the case where there is a current IOLoop. If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current IOLoop, then it should make a new IOLoop current. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop, then it should raise an error.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable and then use that variable to make decisions based on the current IOLoop's existence.
