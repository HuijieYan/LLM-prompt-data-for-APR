## Analyzing the buggy function:
The initialize function is supposed to set the current IOLoop instance, but there are potential error locations within the function that could cause issues. 

## Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` does not seem to be handling the case when `make_current` is False.
2. The `self.make_current()` is called within both the if and elif blocks, which could lead to potential redundant code execution.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is that it does not handle the case when `make_current` is explicitly set to False. Additionally, the `self.make_current()` is being redundantly called in both the if and elif blocks.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `make_current` is explicitly set to False, and eliminate redundant code execution by calling `self.make_current()` only once after evaluating all conditions.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
