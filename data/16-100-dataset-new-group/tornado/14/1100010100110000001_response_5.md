The cause of the bug is that the `make_current` variable is not being handled correctly in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a `RuntimeError`, but it is not doing so properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.initialized():
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we check if the IOLoop is already initialized using the `IOLoop.initialized()` function, and if so, we raise a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.
