The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class. The function takes a parameter `make_current` which, if set to `True`, is supposed to make the new `IOLoop` instance the current instance. If set to `None` or `False`, the function should only make the new `IOLoop` instance the current instance if there is no current instance already.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` does not handle the case where there is an existing current instance and `make_current` is `None`.
2. The condition `elif make_current:` does not handle the case where `make_current` is `False`, and there is no current instance.

Cause of the bug:
The bug causes the function to not handle the scenarios where `make_current` is `None` or `False` and there is an existing current instance. This results in the incorrect behavior of either not making the new instance the current instance or raising an error when it shouldn't.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition for `make_current is None` to handle the case where there is an existing current instance and `make_current` is `None`.
2. Add a condition to handle the case where `make_current` is `False` and there is an existing current instance.

Given the explanation, the corrected version of the buggy function is:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `make_current` parameter is properly handled for all scenarios, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub post.
