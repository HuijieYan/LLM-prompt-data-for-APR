The bug is caused by the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class not handling the case where `make_current` is `True`, but the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This results in the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly, as seen in the error message and GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` method needs to be modified to check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, and raise an error only if the instance exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion and the failing test case.
