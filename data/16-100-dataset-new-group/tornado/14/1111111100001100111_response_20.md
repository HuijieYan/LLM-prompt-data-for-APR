The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and makes it current based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. The issue on GitHub suggests that there is a discrepancy in the behavior of the function when checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to determine if a current IOLoop instance exists, but the subsequent logic does not handle this condition correctly. This condition checks if there is no current IOLoop instance, and if so, it tries to make the current instance. However, the logic should be reversed, and it should only try to make the current instance if there is no current instance already.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly check for and handle the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if current_ioloop is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first store the value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_ioloop`. Then, we use this variable to check if there is a current IOLoop instance, and based on the value of `make_current`, we either make the current instance or raise an error if it already exists.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and handle the logic of making the current IOLoop instance more accurately.
