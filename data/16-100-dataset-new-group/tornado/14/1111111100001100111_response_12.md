The bug in the initialize function of the IOLoop class occurs when the make_current parameter is set to None. In this case, the function checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it calls the make_current function. However, the logic is inconsistent if make_current is None. Instead of calling make_current in this case, it should simply create a new IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the initialize function to handle the case when make_current is None. We should instantiate a new IOLoop instance if there is no current instance, instead of calling make_current.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self = IOLoop()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function now correctly handles the case when make_current is None by creating a new IOLoop instance when no current instance exists. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
