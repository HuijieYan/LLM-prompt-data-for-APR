### Identified Bug Location
The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance, but it contains a logic flaw that causes it to incorrectly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop`. This flaw may lead to the unexpected raising of a `RuntimeError` even when the current `IOLoop` instance is not present.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect conditional checks within the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

However, the initial condition when `make_current` is `None` also checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. This can cause conflicts with the subsequent `make_current` call, potentially resulting in an incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the conditional checks within the `initialize` function need to be revised. Specifically, the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance should be adjusted based on the value of the `make_current` parameter.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the `current_instance` variable to avoid redundant function calls.
- The condition `if make_current is None` now checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`, and if so, it only checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and sets it if not present.
- The `elif make_current` condition checks if `make_current` is `True`, and if it is, it only raises a `RuntimeError` if the `current_instance` is not `None`, indicating that the `IOLoop` already exists.
- The corrected version addresses the conditional logic issues and should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
