The cause of the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect. Specifically, when `make_current` is not provided, the function checks if there is no current instance and then it calls the `make_current` function. However, this logic is incorrect because it should only call `make_current` if there is no current instance.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the current instance of `IOLoop`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
- When `make_current` is not provided, the function checks if there is a current instance and then it calls the `make_current` function.
- When `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, the function checks if there is a current instance and then raises a `RuntimeError` if there is one, otherwise it calls the `make_current` function.

With this corrected logic, the `initialize` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test case.
