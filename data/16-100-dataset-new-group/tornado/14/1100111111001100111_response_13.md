The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop object with a current instance. However, there is an issue with the logic of the `initialize` function, as it does not handle the `make_current` parameter properly and the check for an existing current IOLoop instance is incorrect.

The problem with the current implementation is that it always calls `self.make_current()` regardless of the value of `make_current`, and it also checks for an existing IOLoop incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be updated to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and correctly check for an existing current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first retrieve the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then we check the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current instance before making any decisions.

This corrected version should address the issues with the original implementation and make the `initialize` function behave as expected, fixing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
