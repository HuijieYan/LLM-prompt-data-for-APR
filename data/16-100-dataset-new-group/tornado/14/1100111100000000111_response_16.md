The buggy function `initialize` is calling the functions `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and `self.make_current()` based on the value of `make_current`. The issue is that when `make_current` is None, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is checking if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if not, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, when `make_current` is not None, it is still checking the same condition and if it's None, it raises a RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for the case when `make_current` is not None so that it doesn't raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop instance is None.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this correction, the function checks if the current IOLoop instance exists before raising a RuntimeError for "already exists" when `make_current` is not None. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
