### Analysis
The `initialize` function is designed to set the current IOLoop. It takes an optional parameter `make_current`, which, if set to `True`, should make the current IOLoop. However, the current logic seems to have issues, as it is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists.

### Potential Error Location
The issue seems to be in the conditional checks for `make_current` and the current existence of an IOLoop.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists. This leads to the `RuntimeError` not being raised as expected in the failing test.

### Suggested Fix
We need to modify the initialize function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists. This may involve checking if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make the current IOLoop.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

### Updated error case:
#### Input
make_current, value: `True`, type: `bool`
#### Output
The corrected initialize function should now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists, raising a `RuntimeError` as expected.
