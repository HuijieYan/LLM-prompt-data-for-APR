### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. When the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists, even though the check for the existing IOLoop instance returns None.

The issue reported on GitHub suggests that there is a discrepancy in the behavior of the code at line 252 in `ioloop.py`, where the `IOLoop.current` function is called with `instance=False`. This discrepancy causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Location
The potential error location is within the `initialize` function, particularly the conditional check when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of the `IOLoop.current` function when called with `instance=False`. This inconsistency causes the conditional check within the `initialize` function to produce incorrect results, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when the IOLoop instance is not present.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the conditional check for the existing IOLoop instance needs to be modified to ensure it accurately determines whether the instance already exists or not. Additionally, the behavior of the `IOLoop.current` function with `instance=False` needs to be reviewed to address the reported discrepancy.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:  # Update the condition to check if IOLoop instance is None
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:  # Update the condition to check if IOLoop instance is not None
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks have been modified to accurately determine the presence or absence of the IOLoop instance. The behavior of the `IOLoop.current` function has also been reviewed to ensure consistency in its return value.
