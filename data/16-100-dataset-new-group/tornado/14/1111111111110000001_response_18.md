The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class from `tornado/ioloop.py`. This class is used to create an I/O event loop and handle network connections in non-blocking mode. The `initialize` method sets up the event loop with the possibility of making it the current I/O loop.

The failing test `test_force_current` attempts to create an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and then checks whether the newly created `IOLoop` is the current loop. The error message shows that the test is failing because the call to `IOLoop(make_current=True)` raises a `RuntimeError`.

Upon analyzing the code, it is evident that the bug is in the `initialize` method due to incorrect logic for making the loop current. When `make_current=True`, the method should ensure that there is no current I/O loop and then make this loop the current one. This change is missing, resulting in the `RuntimeError` being raised.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be updated to properly handle the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current=True`, it should ensure that no current I/O loop already exists before making the loop current.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_loop is not None and current_loop is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("Another IOLoop instance already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This modified code first checks if there is already a current I/O loop when `make_current=True`. If another instance exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it makes the current instance the current I/O loop.
