The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` even if the IOLoop is not currently set as the current IOLoop. This behavior does not match the expected behavior described in the test case, which is causing the test to fail and has resulted in a GitHub issue being raised. The issue is related to the discrepancy between the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the subsequent `RuntimeError` being raised.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly check whether the IOLoop is already set as the current IOLoop when `make_current=True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the condition `if make_current:` to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None before raising the `RuntimeError`. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current=True`.

With this fix, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` argument and pass the failing test case.
