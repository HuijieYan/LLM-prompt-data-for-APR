The bug in the provided code is that the `initialize` function is using an incorrect method to access the `current` function from the `IOLoop` class. 

The potential error locations in the code are:
1. Incorrect usage of the `current` function from the `IOLoop` class.
2. Potential logical error in the conditional statements within the `initialize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is incorrectly accessing the `current` function from the `IOLoop` class by using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` instead of `self.current(instance=False)`.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to correctly utilize the `current` method from the `IOLoop` class.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions remain unchanged

    # this is the corrected initialize function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly use the `current` method from the `IOLoop` class. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
