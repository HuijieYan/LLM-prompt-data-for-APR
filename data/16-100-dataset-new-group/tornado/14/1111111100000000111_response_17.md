Analysis:
The buggy function "initialize" is part of the class IOLoop, which is responsible for creating and managing I/O loops in the Tornado framework. The issue on GitHub highlights that when calling IOLoop.current with the argument "instance=False", it is returning None. However, in the "initialize" function, there is a check for this condition and it proceeds to raise a RuntimeError with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This behavior is contradictory and must be resolved.

Potential error locations:
1. The conditional statement for "make_current is None" in the "initialize" function.
2. The conditional statement for "make_current" in the "initialize" function.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to a logical inconsistency in the "initialize" function. When "make_current" is None, it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if not, it calls the "make_current" method. However, when "make_current" is set to True, it again checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and raises an error if it does. This contradiction causes the bug.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the logic in the "initialize" function needs to be modified. When "make_current" is set to True, it should only call the "make_current" method if the current IOLoop instance does not exist. The redundant check for the current instance can be removed.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
