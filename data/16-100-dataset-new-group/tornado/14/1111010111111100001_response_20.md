The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance. However, the bug causes an issue when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` after another instance has already been made current.

The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then verify that it is the current instance. It then attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the buggy function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` function needs to be updated to handle the case where a new `IOLoop` instance is being created with `make_current=True` after another instance has already been made current. It should check if a current instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if so.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance and correctly raises a `RuntimeError` if one already exists when a new instance is being created with `make_current=True`. This should resolve the issue with the failing test and ensure that the corrected version passes the test.
