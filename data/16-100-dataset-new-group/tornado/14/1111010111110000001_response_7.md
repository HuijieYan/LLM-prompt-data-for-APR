The bug in the initialize function of class IOLoop in the file tornado/ioloop.py is causing the failing test test_force_current from tornado/test/ioloop_test.py to raise a RuntimeError.

The initialize function is currently checking if the IOLoop instance exists and setting it as the current instance if make_current is True, or raising a RuntimeError if the instance already exists. However, the bug seems to be in the logic that checks for an existing current IOLoop instance.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the existence of a current IOLoop instance is incorrect. It's not properly handling the case where an instance already exists, and it's incorrectly setting the instance as current, leading to the RuntimeError when trying to set the IOLoop as the current instance.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the initialize function to properly handle the case where a current IOLoop instance already exists. We should only try to make the IOLoop instance current if make_current is True and no current instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the initialize function will properly handle the case where an IOLoop instance is already set as the current instance. This should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass without raising a RuntimeError.
