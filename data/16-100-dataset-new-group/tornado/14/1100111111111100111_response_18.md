The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing the test to fail. The issue is related to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter, leading to the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error.

The problem arises from the logic in the `initialize` function's conditional statements. When `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, it raises the `RuntimeError`. However, due to the incorrect logic, it is raising the error even when the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is indeed `None`, which is causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the conditional statements in the `initialize` function need to be adjusted to correctly handle the cases when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function correctly checks if a current `IOLoop` exists based on the `make_current` parameter and only raises the `RuntimeError` if one already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
