The buggy function `initialize` is causing the failing test in the `test_force_current` method of the `IOLoop` class. The issue reported in GitHub raises a question about the behavior of the function when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` on line 252 and suggests that it should not raise an "already exists" error in that case.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the bug lies in the conditional statements checking for the `make_current` parameter. The function is not handling the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly assumes that if `make_current` is `None` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is also `None`, then it should call `self.make_current()`. This behavior does not align with the intended logic of the function, as explained in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements need to be modified to check for the correct conditions and handle them appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        return  # Exit the function after checking the condition

    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")

        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the cases where `make_current` is `None` and when it is `True`. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
