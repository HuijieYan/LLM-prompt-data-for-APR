The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the current IOLoop based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. The problem arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, but there is already a current IOLoop instance present.

The cause of the bug is in the conditional statement:
```python
elif make_current:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```
In this code block, when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance and raises an error if so. However, it doesn't attempt to make the IOLoop current even though that is the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional block to always attempt to make the IOLoop current when `make_current` is `True`. Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            # If current IOLoop already exists, make it the current instance
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("No current IOLoop exists")
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If there is, it makes it the current instance. If not, it raises an error. This captures the intended behavior of the `initialize` function.
