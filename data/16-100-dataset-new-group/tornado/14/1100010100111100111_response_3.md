## Analysis
The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is True. However, the code is incorrectly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop, and if it is not None, it raises a RuntimeError.

The failing test is trying to force the creation of the current IOLoop, which should not result in a RuntimeError.

The GitHub issue indicates confusion about the logic at line 252 and questions why the RuntimeError is being raised when the current IOLoop is not None.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the code checks for the existing IOLoop instance incorrectly. It should only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and there is already an existing IOLoop instance.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance needs to be modified. The RuntimeError should only be raised if `make_current` is True and there is already an existing IOLoop instance. Additionally, if `make_current` is None, it should make the IOLoop current if it doesn't already exist.

## Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
