The buggy function `initialize` in class `IOLoop` is failing the test `test_force_current`. The `initialize` function is supposed to set the current IOLoop instance. When `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current IOLoop instance and raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance. When `make_current` is `None` (the default value), it should only set the current IOLoop instance if there is no current instance.

The bug in the current implementation is that when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is no current instance, but it should be checking if there is already a current instance. Additionally, the `self.make_current()` should be called when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, the condition in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is `True` needs to be changed to check if there is already a current instance, and then set the current instance using `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()  # Set the current instance
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
