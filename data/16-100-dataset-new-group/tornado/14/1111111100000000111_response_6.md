Potential error location: 
The potential error location within the buggy code is in the `initialize` function where it checks if the `IOLoop.current` is None and then attempts to raise a RuntimeError based on that condition.

Cause of the bug: 
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. If `make_current` is None, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None and then tries to make it the current one, which is redundant and can cause unexpected behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by simplifying the logic in the `initialize` function. It should directly check if `make_current` is True, and if so, then it should raise an error if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic directly checks if `make_current` is True and then raises an error if the current IOLoop instance exists.
