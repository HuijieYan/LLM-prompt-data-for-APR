The cause of the bug is the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the provided source code. It is supposed to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class, but the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. The logic checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if one already exists when `make_current=True`.

The potential error locations are within the if-else conditions for `make_current` being `None` or `True`, and when checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to update the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases where `make_current=None` or `make_current=True`, and to check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance accordingly.

The corrected version of the `initialize` function is provided below:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is fixed in the `elif` condition when `make_current` is `True`. The logic correctly raises a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance exists in this case.
