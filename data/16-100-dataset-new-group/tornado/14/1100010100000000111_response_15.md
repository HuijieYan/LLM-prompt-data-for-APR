The buggy function "initialize" in the ioloop.py file has an issue related to the use of the "make_current" argument and the condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists. The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in the logic when checking the condition for the current IOLoop instance's existence.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance is None or not.
2. The logic for handling the "make_current" argument.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not correctly handle the case when the current IOLoop instance is None, resulting in an incorrect raise of the "already exists" RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the current IOLoop instance should be modified to accurately determine if it already exists or not. Additionally, the logic for handling the "make_current" argument needs to be adjusted to ensure that the IOLoop instance is properly created or raised an error as needed.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the current IOLoop instance is assigned to a variable before the condition checks. This ensures that the same current IOLoop instance is used consistently throughout the function. The condition checks for the "make_current" argument and the existing current IOLoop instance have been adjusted accordingly.
