The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to set the current IOLoop as the thread's current IOLoop if `make_current` is not specified. If `make_current` is True, it should raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect usage of `self.make_current()` without checking if an IOLoop instance already exists.
2. Inconsistent handling of the `make_current` argument.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where `make_current` is True, and an IOLoop instance already exists. It tries to call `self.make_current()` without checking if there is already a current IOLoop, leading to the RuntimeError being incorrectly raised.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the existing current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first check if `make_current` is None or True. Then, we get the current IOLoop instance and raise a RuntimeError if it already exists. Finally, we call `self.make_current()` only if the conditions are met. This ensures that the function behaves as intended and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
