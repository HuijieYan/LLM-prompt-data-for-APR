The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly checking for the current instance before attempting to make a new instance current. 

The bug occurs in the `initialize` function, where it checks if the `make_current` argument is None but does not handle the case where `make_current` is True. The bug causes the `initialize` function to incorrectly handle the logic for making the IOLoop current.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `initialize` function must be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` argument. Below is a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected function:
1. We first retrieve the current instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
2. We check if `make_current` is None and if a current instance does not exist, we make the current instance.
3. We also handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current instance already exists by raising a `RuntimeError`.
4. In all cases where `make_current` is None or True, we call `self.make_current()` to make the instance current.

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test.
