The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, and the error message indicates that the "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, the function does not properly handle the case when the current IOLoop already exists. It should check if the current IOLoop exists before attempting to make it current.

To fix the bug:
1. Add a check to see if the current IOLoop already exists before trying to make it current when `make_current` is `True`.
2. If the current IOLoop already exists, raise an exception.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the case when the current IOLoop already exists and will raise an exception as intended.
