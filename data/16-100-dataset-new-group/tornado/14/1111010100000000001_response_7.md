The buggy function 'initialize' is a part of the 'IOLoop' class. This function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current instance if 'make_current' is set to True. However, there are potential error locations within the function:

1. In the first 'if' statement, IOLoop.current(instance=False) is used, but it should be IOLoop.current(make_current=False).

2. In the 'elif' statement, the condition to check if the current IOLoop already exists and make it the current IOLoop is incorrect.

The buggy function is using the wrong method and contains a faulty condition, causing it to not work as intended.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to use the correct method IOLoop.current(make_current=False) to check for the current IOLoop and make it the current instance if it does not exist. Then, in the 'elif' statement, check if make_current is True and make the IOLoop the current instance, raising an error if it already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(make_current=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(make_current=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the IOLoop.current(make_current=False) method is used to check for the current IOLoop, and the conditions are modified to properly handle the behavior of the 'initialize' function.
