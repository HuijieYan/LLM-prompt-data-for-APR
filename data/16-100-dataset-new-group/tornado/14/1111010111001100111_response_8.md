The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it incorrectly handles the `make_current` parameter. The bug causes the function to raise a `RuntimeError` even when `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is actually `None`. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior and the GitHub issue raised by the user.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be modified. The correct behavior should be to check if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is also `None` before calling `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True` but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, then a `RuntimeError` should be raised. Additionally, if `make_current` is `None`, the function should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and then call `self.make_current()` if it is.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # ... (other class members)

    # Fixed version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved and the failing test should pass.
