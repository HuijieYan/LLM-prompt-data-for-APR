### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` checks for an existing current IOLoop and raises a `RuntimeError` if one already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. However, this check is flawed because it fails to consider the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing current IOLoop.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check that raises the `RuntimeError` and ensure that it only raises the error when `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop already exists.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
