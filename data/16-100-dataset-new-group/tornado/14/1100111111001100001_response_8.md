The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the way the `make_current` parameter is being handled. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the current logic of the function is not achieving this.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to correctly check if the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is correctly raised when the current IOLoop already exists and `make_current` is `True`. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
