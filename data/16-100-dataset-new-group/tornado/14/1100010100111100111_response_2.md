### Bug Explanation
The `initialize` function is expected to initialize the IOLoop, and if `make_current` is `True`, it should ensure that the current IOLoop instance exists. However, the bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` even when the current IOLoop instance exists.

The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is evaluated. If `make_current` is `True`, the function correctly checks if the current IOLoop instance exists, but it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when the instance already exists. This behavior is not aligned with the expected functionality.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance exists needs to be adjusted. If `make_current` is `True`, the function should only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop instance does not exist. If the instance already exists, it should proceed without raising an error.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that the current IOLoop instance exists without raising unnecessary errors. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should resolve the failing test case.
