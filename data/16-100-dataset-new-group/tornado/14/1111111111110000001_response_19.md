The bug in the `initialize` function causes a RuntimeError to be raised when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. The error message indicates that the `current IOLoop` already exists.

The issue is related to the logic in the `initialize` function where the check for an existing instance of `IOLoop` is not being handled correctly. The bug specifically occurs in the `make_current` case where it should check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before allowing the new one to be created. However, the current implementation tries to create a new `IOLoop` before checking, leading to the RuntimeError being raised.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be modified to first check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to create a new one with the `make_current=True` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` method will first check if there's an existing current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`. This should resolve the bug and allow the failing test (`test_force_current`) to pass.
