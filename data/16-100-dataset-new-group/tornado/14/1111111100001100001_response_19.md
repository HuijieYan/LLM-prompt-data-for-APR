There are several issues with the buggy function:

1. The `make_current` parameter is not being used properly within the `initialize` function as it does not match the usage outlined in the class documentation.

2. The comparison `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not appropriate and doesn't align with the intended usage.

3. The function seems to have redundant local versions of the `current` and `make_current` functions, which might be causing confusion.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter according to the class documentation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `make_current` parameter is now used as a boolean flag to check if the current IOLoop exists and raise an error if it does. The redundant local versions of the `current` and `make_current` functions have been removed.
