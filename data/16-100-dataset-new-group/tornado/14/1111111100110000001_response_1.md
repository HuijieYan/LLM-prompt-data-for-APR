# Analysis
1. The function `initialize` is a method of the `IOLoop` class but is trying to access another method `make_current` without referencing it properly using `self`.
2. The buggy function is throwing a `RuntimeError` because it is not able to correctly identify the state of the current IOLoop instance.
3. The bug occurs because the method `make_current()` is not properly referenced within the `IOLoop` class, and the condition to check the existence of the current IOLoop is not being handled properly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the way the `make_current` method is referenced within the `initialize` method, and adjust the conditions to correctly check the state of the current IOLoop instance.

# Bug Fix

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other methods...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the above corrected version, the `make_current` and `current` methods are referenced using `self.make_current` and `self.current` within the `initialize` method. This ensures that the methods are accessed in the context of the current instance of the `IOLoop` class. Additionally, the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` is updated to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`.
