Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the `initialize` function is incorrectly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop. The bug occurs when `make_current` is True and there is already an existing IOLoop instance.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is performing redundant checks for the existence of the current IOLoop, leading to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.

To fix the bug, the function should directly check if `make_current` is True and then raise a RuntimeError only if the current IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the correct checks for the existence of the current IOLoop are performed, and the RuntimeError will only be raised if there is an existing instance and `make_current` is True. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
