The cause of the bug in the `initialize` function is that when `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current()` is `None`, but it does not actually set the current `IOLoop` instance. This causes the failing test to fail when it tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, the current `IOLoop` instance is set.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
