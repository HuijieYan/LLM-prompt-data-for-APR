The bug in the provided function is that when `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop does not exist and then raises an error. This is not the expected behavior when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition for `make_current` to directly call `self.make_current()` without checking if the current IOLoop exists or not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the specified failing test case should pass.
