The cause of the bug:
In the buggy function `initialize`, the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop and making it current is flawed. When `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if the current IOLoop is None, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError` claiming that the current IOLoop already exists. This contradicts the intended behavior.

The fix strategy:
We should modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists. We can achieve this by checking if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance is not None. In this case, we should simply exit the function without raising a `RuntimeError`.

The corrected version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if the current IOLoop already exists
                return  # Exit the function without raising an error
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the bug in the original function should be fixed, and it should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
