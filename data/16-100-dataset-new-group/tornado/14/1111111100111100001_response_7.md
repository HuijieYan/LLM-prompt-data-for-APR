The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the RuntimeError to be raised when `make_current` is set to `True`. The bug occurs because the if condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is triggering the raise of the RuntimeError, when it should actually be allowing the function to proceed by setting the current IOLoop. This is then causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to update the if condition in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the if condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when a current IOLoop already exists, and the function will make the IOLoop current when necessary.
