Based on the code and the failing test, the buggy function `initialize` is expected to set the current IOLoop instance. However, it is not working as intended, leading to the failing test case `test_force_current`.

The potential error in the buggy function seems to be in the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function, where it checks whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not.

The bug is caused by the incorrect evaluation of the conditions in the `initialize` function. The if-else conditions are not checking for the correct values and the behavior does not match the expected functionality mentioned in the failing test case.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to update the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existing IOLoop instance and handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other functions are unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditions are updated to correctly check for the existence of the IOLoop instance and handle the `make_current` parameter as per the intended functionality.

With this correction, the failing test case `test_force_current` should pass, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
