Analysis:
The buggy function "initialize" in the IOLoop class checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and then either makes the current IOLoop or raises an error if it already exists. The issue on GitHub points out that it raises an error even if the current IOLoop is None.

Potential error location:
The conditional check for 'make_current' and the subsequent check for the current IOLoop instance are potential error locations.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the condition for checking the current IOLoop instance is not properly handled. The code is not correctly handling the case when the current IOLoop instance is None.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the condition for 'make_current' and the subsequent check for the current IOLoop instance.
2. If 'make_current' is None and the current IOLoop instance is also None, make the current IOLoop.
3. If 'make_current' is True and the current IOLoop instance is already present, raise an error indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.
4. If None of the above conditions are met, do nothing.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    # else, do nothing
```

By correcting the conditional checks and adding a condition for when 'make_current' is True and the current IOLoop exists, we fix the bug.
