The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current IOLoop instance, but it has a bug in the logic that checks whether an IOLoop already exists or not. 

Potential error location: 
The bug is located in the logic that checks whether an IOLoop instance already exists or not.

Cause of the bug: 
The bug occurs due to incorrect logic in the if-elif block. When `make_current=None`, the function should check if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, then make the current instance. However, the current logic does not correctly check for the existence of an IOLoop instance in this case.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the if-elif block to correctly check if an IOLoop instance already exists and only make the current instance if it doesn't exist. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `make_current` is None and if the current IOLoop instance is None, then it will set the current instance. If `make_current` is True, it will check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise an error if it does.
