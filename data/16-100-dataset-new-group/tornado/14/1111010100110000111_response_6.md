The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is meant to set the current `IOLoop` instance, and it takes an optional argument `make_current` to control whether the new instance should become the current one. However, the bug occurs when the function attempts to set the current `IOLoop` instance using the `make_current` argument.

The cause of the bug lies in the conditional check for the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function incorrectly checks the `IOLoop.current` instance without considering the case where it is already set. As a result, the `RuntimeError` is raised, indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, leading to the failing test scenario.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements within the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly check for the existing current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to set a new one.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other parts of the class definition)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) and not make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the conditional check for setting the current `IOLoop` instance using the `make_current` argument has been modified to accurately handle the cases where it already exists or not. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as intended.
