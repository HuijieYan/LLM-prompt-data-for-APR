The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it incorrectly checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`, which leads to a `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly checks for the presence of a current instance of `IOLoop` and raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists. This behavior contradicts the intended usage described in the class docs, and the failing test `test_force_current` fails because it expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised, but it is incorrectly raised due to the bug in the `initialize` function.

To fix the bug, the function should only make the `IOLoop` instance current if `make_current=True` and there is no current instance already. If a current instance already exists and `make_current=True`, a `RuntimeError` should be raised, as intended by the failing test.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and behave as intended, allowing the failing test to pass.
