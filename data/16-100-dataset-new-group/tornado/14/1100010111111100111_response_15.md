The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is intended to initialize an IOLoop instance and make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is specified. However, the function is currently not working correctly, as evidenced by the failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`.

The failing test tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another instance with the same parameter, which should result in a `RuntimeError` being raised. However, the test fails with the error message indicating that the "current IOLoop already exists".

The potential error location in the buggy function is the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. The function should correctly determine if the current IOLoop already exists and either make it the current IOLoop or raise an error based on the value of `make_current`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current IOLoop instance. As a result, the code does not behave as expected, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter should be modified to correctly check the current IOLoop instance and either make it the current IOLoop or raise an error based on the value of `make_current`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
