The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to stem from case sensitivity, where the function is not checking for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner. This is consistent with the description of the GitHub issues, where the problem is identified as the function not being case insensitive and not properly handling table names.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name with the contents of the `stdout` in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition
                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the content of `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports and also fix the failing tests.
