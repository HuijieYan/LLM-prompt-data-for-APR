The error in the `HiveCommandClient` class seems to be related to the implementation of the `table_exists` method. The issue is with the logic in `table_exists` which is failing to determine if a table exists in the database. There are a few potential error locations within the method:

1. The conditional check for determining the existence of a table is incorrect.
2. The `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function might not be parsed correctly.

The failing test attempts to verify if the `table_exists` method correctly determines the existence of a given table, without taking into consideration the table's case sensitivity. The error message suggests that it fails to validate the existence of a table due to incorrect logic implementation within the `table_exists` function.

To fix the bug, you should modify the logic within the `table_exists` method to correctly determine the existence of the table in the database. You also need to make sure that the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function is correctly parsed to obtain the relevant information about the table's existence.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout != ""
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""
```
