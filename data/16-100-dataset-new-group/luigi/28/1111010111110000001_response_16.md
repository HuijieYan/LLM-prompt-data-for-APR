The buggy function `table_exists` is expected to return whether a table exists in a database for a given partition.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions for returning true or false based on the presence of the table and partition in the stdout.

The cause of the bug is that when the result is checked for the presence of a table, it returns inaccurate values leading to failed test cases.

An appropriate strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditions for returning true or false based on the presence of the table and partition in the stdout.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return stdout != ""
```
