The bug in the `table_exists` function is occurring because the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not working as expected. The condition should check if the 'table' is present in the 'stdout' and return `True` if found, otherwise `False`. However, in the failing test cases, this condition is not behaving as expected.

To fix the bug, update the condition to explicitly check if the 'table' is present in the 'stdout' using the `in` keyword. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # other functions...

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return table in stdout  # check if 'table' is present in 'stdout'
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # return True if 'stdout' has content, otherwise False
```

The corrected function explicitly checks if the 'table' is present in the 'stdout' using the `in` keyword, and returns `True` if found, otherwise `False`. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
