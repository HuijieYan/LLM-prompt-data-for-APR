The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely caused by the conditional checks in the if-else statements. The first conditional statement checks if `stdout` is truthy and whether `table` is in `stdout`. This may not work as expected, especially when `stdout` contains additional characters such as whitespace or newlines.

The second conditional statement checks if `stdout` is truthy, but regardless of its content, it will always return `True` if `stdout` is not an empty string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to check the exact match of `table` in `stdout` and to handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{} = "{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```
