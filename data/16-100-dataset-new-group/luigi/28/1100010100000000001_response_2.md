The potential error in the buggy function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function may not be working as intended, leading to incorrect results being returned. Another potential error is the usage of the `self.partition_spec` method, which may not be implemented correctly.

The buggy function is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database and partition. If the partition is not specified, it uses a 'show tables' command, and if the partition is specified, it uses a 'show partitions' command.

To fix the bug, we should first ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function works correctly and returns the expected output. Additionally, we need to check the implementation of the `self.partition_spec` method and make sure it provides the correct partition specification.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the queries to properly use the `show tables in {database}` and `show partitions {table} partition ({partition})` commands. Additionally, we have used the `strip` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the output and check if the resulting string is not empty to determine if the table exists.
