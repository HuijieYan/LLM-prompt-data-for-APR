The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not correctly handle the case where a table exists in Hive. It returns `False` when it should return `True` for existing tables. This is evident from the failing test cases and their associated error messages, which indicate that the function is returning the wrong result.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks for the existence of a table and returns the appropriate boolean value.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # converting the stdout to boolean directly
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected results for checking the existence of tables in Hive.
