The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases provided and is also linked to two GitHub issues #896 and #897 regarding case insensitivity. This means that the table names are being treated as case sensitive, causing the tests to fail.

The bug is located within the `table_exists` function where it compares the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd` without considering case insensitivity.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison, so that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the case insensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issues.
