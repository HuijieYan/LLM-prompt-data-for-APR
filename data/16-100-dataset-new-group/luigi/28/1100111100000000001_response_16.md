The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the condition checking and in the call to the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The condition checking in the `table_exists` function seems to be incorrect as it is using the `and` operator to check if `stdout` has a value and if `table` is in `stdout`. This might lead to unexpected behavior.

The call to the `run_hive_cmd` function within the `else` block is also incorrect as it is not passing the correct arguments.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect condition checking and the incorrect arguments passed to the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to unexpected behavior in the `table_exists` function.

To fix the bug, the following corrected version of the `table_exists` function can be used:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the condition checking is simplified to return `table in stdout` directly. Additionally, the correct arguments are passed to the `run_hive_cmd` function within the `else` block.
