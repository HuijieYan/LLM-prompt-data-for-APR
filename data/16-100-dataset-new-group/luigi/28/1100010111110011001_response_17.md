## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

The bug in the original function is that it doesn't handle the return value of `run_hive_cmd` properly and doesn't return the correct boolean value. The corrected version of the function uses the return value as a condition directly which respects the expected returned boolean value.

By removing the unnecessary conditionals in the function and simplifying the return statements, the corrected version of the function is able to produce the correct boolean output based on the received `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

By using the `bool()` function around `stdout` in the `else` branch, the function will return `False` if `stdout` is an empty string, and `True` otherwise.

The corrected version has been updated to reflect these changes and should now pass the provided failing test cases.
