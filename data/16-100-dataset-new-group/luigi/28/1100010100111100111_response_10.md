The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function is failing because it does not handle case insensitivity of table names in Hive.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly. The test cases are failing because the function is not checking for lowercase versions of the table names in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for lowercase versions of the table names in the `stdout` to handle case insensitivity properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issues related to case insensitivity.
