The bug in the table_exists function seems to be with the comparison of the table name in the output. It appears that in case there are no partitions, the bug causes it to incorrectly return False. The failing test shows that when the table name is in the stdout (Hive query output), the function returns False instead of True.

In order to fix this bug, we need to check for the presence of the table name in the stdout after running the hive command and then return True if the table exists. We also need to edit the multiline string that forms the hive command query for the case where there are partitions, by using the partition_spec function that should generate the partition part of the query.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = " ".join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_query})')

            return bool(stdout)  # Converting to bool to indicate if the stdout is valid
```

The corrected version ensures that it returns True when the table exists and False when it doesn't, and it also correctly handles the case when there are partitions and generates a partition-specific query for the Hive command based on the partition input.
