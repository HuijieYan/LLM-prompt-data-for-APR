The bug in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is that the logic for checking the existence of a table is incorrect. The function checks for the presence of a table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, but the validation is not accurate.

The buggy function incorrectly returns based on whether the `stdout` is present or not, rather than checking if the table name is specifically in the `stdout`.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `table_exists` function should be modified to check if the table name is present in the `stdout`. This can be achieved by splitting the `stdout` and then checking if the table is in the list of tables.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Just return the boolean value of stdout
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
