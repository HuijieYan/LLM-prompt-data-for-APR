The buggy function `table_exists` of the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case sensitivity issue properly when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This is causing the failing test cases in the `HiveCommandClientTest` class.

The problem lies in the comparison of the table name against the `stdout` value returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The comparison is not case insensitive, leading to incorrect test outcomes.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` value to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the table names.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other class code...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this change, the comparison of table names is made case insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` value to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the test cases related to the `table_exists` function will pass as expected.
