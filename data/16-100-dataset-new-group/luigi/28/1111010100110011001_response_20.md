```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() == 'OK'  # Check if the stdout is exactly 'OK'
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout.strip())  # Check if the stdout is not empty
```
In the buggy function `table_exists`, the bug is likely caused by the conditions in the if-else statement not correctly handling the stdout output from run_hive_cmd.

The condition `stdout and table in stdout` will only be True if the table name is exactly the same as the stdout. However, the expected output may have additional characters, such as a new line, that are not handled by this condition.

The condition `if stdout: return True` only checks if the stdout is not empty, and if it is not empty, it returns True regardless of the content of stdout.

To fix the bug, the corrected function uses the `strip()` method to remove any leading/trailing whitespaces and newlines from the stdout, and then performs a direct comparison to check if the stdout exactly matches the expected value 'OK' or if it is not empty.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
