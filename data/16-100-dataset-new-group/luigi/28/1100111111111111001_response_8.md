The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the comparison of the `stdout` variable with table names. If the result of the `stdout` is not empty, it should return `True` only if the table name is in the `stdout`. However, the current implementation is returning `True` if `stdout` is not empty, regardless of whether the table name is present.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to explicitly check if the table name is in the `stdout` when `stdout` is not empty. We can use the `in` operator to perform this check.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This version addresses the bug by explicitly checking if the table name is in the `stdout` when `stdout` is not empty, and returning `False` otherwise. Additionally, the condition for the `if` block when `partition` is not `None` has been simplified to return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, and `False` otherwise.
