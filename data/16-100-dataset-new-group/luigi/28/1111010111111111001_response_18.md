The issue with the buggy function seems to be in the logic for checking the existence of a table in the database when a partition is specified. It appears to be returning the opposite result of what is expected in some cases.

The `table_exists` function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if the table does not exist. However, in some cases, it is returning the opposite. 

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the logic inside the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the cases where a partition is specified and ensure that it returns the correct boolean value based on the existence of the table.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

This corrected version should address the bug in the `table_exists` function and properly handle the cases where a partition is specified.
