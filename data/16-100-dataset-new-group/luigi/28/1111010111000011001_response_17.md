The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and is returning incorrect results. It should check for the existence of the table in the output of the command.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of stdout with table in the first case and by not parsing the output correctly in the second case.

A strategy to fix the bug is to parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and check if the table exists in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function properly parses the output of `run_hive_cmd` and checks for the existence of the table, returning the correct result in all cases.
