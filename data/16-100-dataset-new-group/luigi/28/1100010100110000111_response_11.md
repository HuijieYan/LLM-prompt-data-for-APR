The bug in the function `table_exists` is causing the test case to fail due to case sensitivity issues. The bug is related to the comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner, which causes the test case to fail when there are differences in case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case insensitive.

The corrected version of the function `table_exists` is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # make the comparison case insensitive
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # no need for if-else conditions

```

In the modified version, the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. Additionally, the code logic is simplified by directly returning the result of the comparison.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
