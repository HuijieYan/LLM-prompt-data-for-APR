The issue with the table_exists function is that it performs a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the tables returned from the 'show tables' and 'show partitions' commands. This causes the function to return incorrect results when the table name is in a different case than the returned tables.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to make the comparison case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we use the map function to convert all table names to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and fixes the bug described in the GitHub issues.
