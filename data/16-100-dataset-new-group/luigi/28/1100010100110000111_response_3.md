The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity properly. The issue from GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table names. This leads to failing test cases when table names have different cases.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison. This will make sure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub. Now, the comparison is case insensitive, which aligns with the expected behavior.
