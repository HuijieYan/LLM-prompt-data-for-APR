The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition to check if `stdout` contains the table name is incorrect. It should be checking if the table name is present in the lines of `stdout`, rather than just checking if `stdout` itself is truthy.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to split the `stdout` on newline characters and then check if the table name is present in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
