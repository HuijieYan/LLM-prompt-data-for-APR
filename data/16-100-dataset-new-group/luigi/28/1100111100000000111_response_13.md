The buggy function `table_exists` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is causing issues related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue results from the fact that Hive is case insensitive, and thus the function fails to properly account for this behavior, leading to inaccurate results when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should be modified to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner when checking against the stdout of the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, the comparison of the table name against the stdout is performed in a case-insensitive manner by converting both names to lower case using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the function works effectively when checking for the existence of tables in Hive, regardless of the case used in the table names.
