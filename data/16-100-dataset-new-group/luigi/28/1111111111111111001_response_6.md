The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the wrong arguments, leading to incorrect stdout values. Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of a table is flawed, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the `run_hive_cmd` function calls to use the correct arguments for querying table existence and partitions.
2. Update the logic for checking the existence of a table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))
            return stdout is not None and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return stdout is not None

```

In this corrected version:
- The `run_hive_cmd` call is updated to use the correct SQL queries for checking table existence and partitions.
- The logic for checking table existence is improved to handle different stdout values.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
