The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly. The function checks if a table exists in the Hive database, but it doesn't take into account the case of the table name. This results in failing tests and an issue on GitHub, as users expect the function to be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name with the output from Hive in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions inside the class)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing both the table name and the output from Hive in lowercase, it ensures case insensitivity. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
