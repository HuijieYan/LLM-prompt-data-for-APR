The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the wrong output to be returned, leading to the failing test cases with the error message "AssertionError: False is not true". The primary issue is the conditional comparison of the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists or not.

The cause of the bug is due to the `stdout` variable containing "OK\nmytable" when the table exists, but the comparison `stdout and table in stdout` is evaluating to False.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to correctly check if the table exists in the output from the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simply return the boolean representation of stdout
```

Explanation:
- In the original buggy function, the comparison expression `stdout and table in stdout` can lead to unexpected behavior if `stdout` contains unexpected characters or formatting. To fix this, the condition should be converted directly to a boolean value using `bool(stdout)`.
- This implementation ensures that the correct table existence check is performed based on the command output.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
