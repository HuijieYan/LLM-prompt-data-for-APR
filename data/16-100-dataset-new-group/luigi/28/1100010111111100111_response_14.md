Based on the failing tests and the provided runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity, as mentioned in the GitHub issues. When checking for table existence, the function is not handling case sensitivity properly, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output of the command to lower case for comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the command output to lower case before comparison, the function will handle case insensitivity and pass the failing tests. Additionally, it will resolve the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity.
