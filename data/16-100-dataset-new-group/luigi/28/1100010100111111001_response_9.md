The buggy function is failing the tests due to the incorrect checks for the presence of the table in the `stdout`. Specifically, in the first case, the `table in stdout` check is returning `False` when it should be returning `True`. And in the second case, the `table in stdout` is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The buggy function has a conditional statement where it checks the presence of the table in the output of a command. The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `stdout` and the table name. 

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly check if the table name is contained in the `stdout` for both cases.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout  # Check if table is in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout  # Check if table is in stdout
```

With this fix, the function should pass all the failing tests and correctly return if the table exists in the specified database and partition.
