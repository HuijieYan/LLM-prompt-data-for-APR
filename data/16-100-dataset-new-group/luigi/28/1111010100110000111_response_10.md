The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. The function is not case insensitive, causing it to fail when checking for a table with different cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the stdout, leading to case-sensitive comparison issues. This is confirmed by the GitHub issue, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `table.lower()` against the lowercase `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to convert the table name to lowercase before comparison and also convert the `stdout` to lowercase to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. This change resolves the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue and should make the `table_exists` function pass the failing tests.
