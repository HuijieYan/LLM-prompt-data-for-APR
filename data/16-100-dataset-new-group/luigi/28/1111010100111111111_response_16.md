The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case-insensitive and fails to return the expected results in certain cases, which causes the tests to fail. The issue has been identified and reported in GitHub as #896 and its related description.

The cause of the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Apache Hive. The code does not consider case insensitivity, which leads to incorrect comparisons between the table name and the output from Hive.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase and then compare them, making the comparison case-insensitive.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will compare the table name and the output from Hive in a case-insensitive manner. This should resolve the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
