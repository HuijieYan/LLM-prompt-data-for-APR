The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing the tests to fail when checking for tables with different case formats.

To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will now be case-insensitive when comparing table names and will pass the failing tests. This change also aligns with the GitHub issue reports and their proposed solutions.
