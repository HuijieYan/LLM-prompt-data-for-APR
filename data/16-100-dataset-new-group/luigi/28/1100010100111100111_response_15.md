The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing tests due to case sensitivity. The function is not checking for the table name in a case-insensitive manner, leading to assertions failing when the table name differs in case.

The proposed solution is to change the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding case insensitivity.
