The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the `stdout` variable. It is expected that `stdout` will always contain the table name if the table exists, but the function currently checks if `table in stdout`, which may not always work due to varying output formats.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to explicitly check if the table is present in the `stdout` output, regardless of its format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout.split()
```

This modification ensures that the `stdout` output is split into individual entries, making it easier to check if the table name exists within it.
