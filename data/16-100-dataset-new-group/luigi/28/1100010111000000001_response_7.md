Based on the provided code and test, it seems that the `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is failing to correctly determine if a table exists in the database. The issue may be stemming from how the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function is being handled in the `table_exists` function.

The potential error locations within the `table_exists` function are in the conditional checks for `return stdout` and `return True` or `return False`. The function does not handle the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function in order to determine if the table exists or not. This is evident from the failing test, where the expected results are not being returned by the function.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should properly parse and handle the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function to accurately determine if the table exists in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    return table in stdout
```

By updating the `table_exists` function to properly parse the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the correct boolean value based on whether the table exists or not, the bug should be fixed and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
