The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by incorrect logic and handling of the `stdout` variable.

In the first part of the function, the `stdout` variable is populated using a command to check if the table exists. The return value is then checked for the presence of the table name. However, in the case where `stdout` has a value (i.e., the table exists), the function is returning the opposite of what is expected.

In the second part of the function, when a partition is specified, the method constructs a Hive command to check for the existence of the specified partition. However, the logic for checking the response is not consistent with the definition of how the partition would indicate existence.

Additionally, the `partition_spec` method is used to generate the partition description, but there is no indication of its behavior or correctness.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the response from the Hive command needs to be revised to correctly evaluate table and partition existence. Additionally, the use of `self.partition_spec` should be verified or updated to ensure it provides the correct partition description.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            partition_cmd = " ".join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_cmd})")
            
            return len(stdout.split("\n")) > 1  # partition exists if there are more than 1 lines in the output

```

In the corrected version, the logic to check for table existence returns a boolean based on whether the table name is present in the `stdout`. For partition existence, it checks if the number of lines in the `stdout` is more than 1, which indicates the partition exists.
