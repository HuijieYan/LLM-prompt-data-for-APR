To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This will address the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing tests.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from `run_hive_cmd`, addressing the case insensitivity issue. This corrected version of the function is aligned with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue, and it should resolve the failing test cases.

This correction ensures that the test cases will pass, and the function will satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
