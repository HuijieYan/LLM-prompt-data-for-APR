The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the comparison of the table name in the output with the actual table name is not performed correctly. The `stdout` variable contains the entire output of the command, and the buggy function only checks if the table name is a substring of the output.
This leads to incorrect results when the table name is a substring of another table name listed in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to split the `stdout` into separate lines and compare each line with the table name, which will ensure an exact match.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout has any content, False if it is empty.
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check for the existence of the table in the stdout by splitting the lines and comparing each line with the table name.

This corrected function should now pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
