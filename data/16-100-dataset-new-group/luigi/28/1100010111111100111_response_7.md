The issue with the buggy function is that it is case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive, but Hive is case insensitive. This means that the function should be modified to make the comparison case insensitive.

The buggy function fails to correctly determine if a table exists because it is performing a case-sensitive comparison. This causes the test cases to fail as they expect the function to return True for tables that exist, regardless of the case. The failing test cases provide input parameter values and the expected return values.

To fix the bug, the buggy function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version of the function, when checking for the existence of the table, the comparison is performed in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the table names returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub. The corrected function should return the expected values for the provided input parameters in the failing test cases.
