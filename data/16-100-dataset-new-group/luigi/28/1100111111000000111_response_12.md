After analyzing the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison between the table name and the tables in the database. The issue reported on GitHub also confirms this by pointing out that table names may be returned in lower case by Hive, causing a case sensitivity problem.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for the case insensitivity of table names in Hive. This leads to the comparison between the provided table name and the tables in the database to fail if there is a case mismatch.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the provided table name and the tables returned from the database to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Existing code...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the provided table name and the tables returned from the database are converted to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
