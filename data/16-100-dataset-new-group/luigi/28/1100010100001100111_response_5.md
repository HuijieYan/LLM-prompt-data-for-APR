The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not account for case sensitivity in the table names. The function fails to accurately determine table existence if the case of the table name in the `stdout` does not match the case of the input `table`. This is in line with the GitHub issue, where it is specified that tables are sometimes defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lowercase.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to check `stdout` against the lowercase version of the input `table`. This ensures that case sensitivity is not an issue when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both `stdout` and the input `table` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that case sensitivity is no longer an issue when checking for table existence.
