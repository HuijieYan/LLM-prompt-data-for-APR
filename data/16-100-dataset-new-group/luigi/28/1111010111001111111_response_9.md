The buggy function is the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class, and its relationship with the failing test is that it does not return the expected result for certain inputs. The test checks if the method correctly determines if a table exists in a Hive database. The expected output is not being met due to the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive. The issue was raised on GitHub with number #896 and points out that the `table_exists` method should be case insensitive.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are identified as the comparison between the input `table` and the `stdout` (output from the Hive command).

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the output from Hive. This leads to the tests failing when the table names do not match exactly in terms of case.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive should be made case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` is made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`. This change ensures that the method correctly identifies the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner, as expected by the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
