The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a few potential error locations. 

1. One potential issue is with the call to `run_hive_cmd` where the string formatting may not be correct for the query when a partition is provided.

2. Another issue is with the condition for checking if the table exists in the output of `run_hive_cmd`, it seems to be using the wrong logic to check if the table exists in the output text.

3. Lastly, the `partition_spec` method seems to be used incorrectly when handling partitions.

The cause of the bug is that the string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` and the logic for checking the table existence in the output are not correct. Also, the `partition_spec` method is used incorrectly when querying partitioned tables.

To fix the bug, instead of directly returning the output of `run_hive_cmd`, we can parse the output and check for the presence of the table or partition.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Construct the partition condition for the query
        partition_condition = " and ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_condition))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of the table in the output of `run_hive_cmd` and constructs the partition condition correctly.
