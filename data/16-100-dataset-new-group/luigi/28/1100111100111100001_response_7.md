The bug in the `table_exists` function is that for case-insensitive table names, the function fails to compare the table name correctly. For case-insensitive table names, the code should perform a case-insensitive comparison.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase, and then comparing them. This will ensure that case differences in the table name do not affect the comparison result.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using the `lower()` method, we ensure that both the table name and the output are compared in a case-insensitive manner. This should fix the bug and make the function work correctly for case-insensitive table names.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
