The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is case-sensitive and does not check for case insensitivity when verifying if a table exists in the database. This issue was identified in GitHub Issue #896, where it was recommended to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison between `table` and `stdout`. The bug causes the function to fail when checking for tables that are defined with capitalized names, as Hive returns table names in lowercase, and the comparison is case-sensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to make it case insensitive. The corrected version of the function should convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test and address the issue posted on GitHub.
