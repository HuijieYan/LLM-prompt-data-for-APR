The bug appears to be in the conditional statement within the `table_exists` function. The function isn't properly checking for the existence of a table in the specified database. Instead, it's returning the result of the string comparison operation, which may not accurately reflect the existence of the table.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to correctly check for the existence of the table and return a boolean value accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `run_hive_cmd` output to determine the existence of the table regardless of whether a partition is specified or not. The function now returns a boolean value based on the truthiness of the `stdout` variable, thus addressing the bug in the original implementation.
