The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be that it incorrectly checks the existence of a table in the database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output, but the conditions for checking the existence of the table are incorrect.

The expected behavior is to check if the table exists in the database, and if a partition is provided, it should also check if the specific partition of the table exists.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to correctly handle the logic for checking the existence of the table and its partitions.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # other functions defined in the class...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_statement = ' and '.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_statement))
            return bool(stdout)
```

The bug was fixed by:
- Using the `show tables in` command to check for table existence in a specific database.
- Building a partition statement based on the provided partition dictionary and using it to check for partition existence.

This should resolve the issue and make the `table_exists` function work correctly in all the test cases provided.
