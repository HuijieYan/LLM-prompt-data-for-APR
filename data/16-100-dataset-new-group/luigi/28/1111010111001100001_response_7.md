The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't correctly check for the existence of a table in the database and instead returns based on the presence of any output from `run_hive_cmd`. Additionally, the partition check is not correctly formatted and doesn't return the expected results.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly parse the output of `run_hive_cmd` and check for the existence of the table, as well as fix the partition check to return the correct boolean value.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')  # Check if the table is in the list of tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Check if the stdout is not empty and return True
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function should now correctly check for the existence of the table and partition and pass the failing test cases.
