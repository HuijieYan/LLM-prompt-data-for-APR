The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not being case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This results in test failures when checking for tables with different casing.

The buggy function's use of the `table in stdout` comparison is case-sensitive, causing the test failures.

To fix this bug, the comparison should be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the comparison is now case insensitive, addressing the failing tests and the GitHub issues.
