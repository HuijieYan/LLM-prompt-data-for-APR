The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the function handles the `stdout` variable. 

The function checks if `stdout` has a value and if the table is in `stdout` before returning a boolean value. However, in the failing test cases, it seems that the function is not handling the output correctly. 

In the first case, the function should return `False` because the table is not found in the `stdout` even though it has a value.

In the second case, the function should return `True` because the table is found in the `stdout`, but it's returning `False`.

In the third and fourth cases, the function is not properly handling the partition information and is always returning `True`.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly check for the presence of the table in the `stdout`, and handle the partition information correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout has a value
    else:
        partition_vals = ', '.join([f'{k} = \'{v}\'' for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_vals})")

        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout has a value
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected values for the given input parameters.
