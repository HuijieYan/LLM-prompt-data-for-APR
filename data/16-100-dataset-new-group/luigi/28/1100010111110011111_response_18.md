The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has two potential error locations:
1. In the if block, the variable `table` should be compared in a case-insensitive manner with the 'stdout' variable.
2. In the else block, the variable `table` should be compared in a case-insensitive manner with the 'stdout' variable after converting them to lowercase.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling case sensitivity properly while comparing the table name with the output of the hive command. This is seen in the failing test where the expected values do not match the actual values during the function's return.

To fix the bug, we should modify the method to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the 'stdout' variable. This will resolve the issue and make sure the function behaves as expected when checking for the existence of a table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return table.lower() in stdout.lower() if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and the provided expected values for each case. Additionally, this correction also addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
