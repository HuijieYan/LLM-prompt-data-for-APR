The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking if a table exists. The `table_exists` function currently checks if the table name is exactly present in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to case-related failures.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table by converting both the table name and the output to lower case.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, the changes address the issue posted on GitHub by making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, which aligns with the community's request.
