The potential error in the buggy function is likely due to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the given database. This issue is causing the failing test cases to produce incorrect results, leading to the AssertionError.

The failing test indicates that the function is case sensitive and does not handle uppercase and lowercase table names the same way, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior. The GitHub issue also confirms that this is a known bug and suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from the command to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function becomes case insensitive and addresses the bug identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
