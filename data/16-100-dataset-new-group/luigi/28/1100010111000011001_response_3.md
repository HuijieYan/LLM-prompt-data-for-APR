## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return "OK" in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""
```

Explanation:
1. The buggy function has an issue with the comparison of the stdout to check if the table exists. It returns the opposite of the expected results in the test cases.
2. In the first case, "OK" should be in the stdout to check if the table exists.
3. In the second case, the function should return True if stdout is not empty.
4. The corrected function now correctly checks if the table exists in both cases by comparing the stdout with the expected values.

The corrected function takes into account the expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return and satisfies all the cases specified.
