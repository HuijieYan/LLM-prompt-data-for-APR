The buggy function is failing the test because it incorrectly checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` does not accurately determine if the table exists, leading to false negatives.

The bug occurs because when `stdout` contains the table name, the function should return `True` to indicate that the table exists. However, the current implementation uses the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`, which results in a `False` value.

To fix the bug, the function should return `True` if the `table` is found in the `stdout` and `False` if it is not found. Additionally, when querying for partitions, the function should return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, indicating the existence of partitions, and `False` otherwise.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and return the expected results.
