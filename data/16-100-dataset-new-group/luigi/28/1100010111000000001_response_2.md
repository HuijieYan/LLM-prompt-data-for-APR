The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a few potential error locations:

1. The first conditional statement in the function checks if `partition` is None, but the subsequent command does not seem to handle the case where `stdout` is empty.
2. The second conditional statement does not handle the case where `stdout` is empty.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the function not handling the case where `stdout` is empty, which can lead to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case where `stdout` is empty and ensure that the correct boolean value is returned based on the contents of `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return bool(stdout and table in stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The first conditional statement now directly returns the boolean expression `bool(stdout and table in stdout)`.
- The second conditional statement returns the boolean expression `bool(stdout)`.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
