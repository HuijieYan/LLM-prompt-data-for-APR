The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the case with mixed case table names. It is performing a case-sensitive check for the existence of the table, which leads to the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                    ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In this corrected version, we are using the `map` function to convert the table names to lowercase before checking for existence, making the comparison case-insensitive.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
