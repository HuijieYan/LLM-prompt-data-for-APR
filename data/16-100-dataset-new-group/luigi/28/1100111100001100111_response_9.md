The bug in the provided code is that the table_exists function is case-sensitive, while Hive tables are case insensitive. This means that if a table is defined as capitalized but the function checks for it in lowercase, the test will fail.

To fix this bug, the function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The other functions in the file are assumed to remain the same

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the table name is converted to lowercase using table.lower() before comparing it with the output from Hive, making the comparison case-insensitive. This addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post about making the table_exists function case insensitive.
