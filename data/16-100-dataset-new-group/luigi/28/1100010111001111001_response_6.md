The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the conditional checks for the `stdout` variable and the comparison with the `table` value. The function returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty and the `table` is in `stdout`, otherwise it returns `False`. However, the checks and comparisons are not correctly handling the cases with partitions.

The strategy to fix the bug is to restructure the conditional checks and comparisons in the `table_exists` function to correctly handle both the cases with and without partitions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
    else:
        partition_clause = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_clause})")

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we split the `stdout` by newline character if `partition` is not None to check for the presence of the table in the output. For the case with partitions, we first get the `partition_clause` and then directly check whether `stdout` is empty to determine if the table exists.

These changes should make the function correctly handle the cases with and without partitions, and the function should now pass the failing test cases.
