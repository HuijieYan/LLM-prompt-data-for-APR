To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive. This means that when we compare the table name with the names in the `stdout`, we should ensure that the comparison is not case sensitive by converting both the table name and the names in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we converted `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This makes the comparison case insensitive and ensures that the `table_exists` function will work as expected, fixing the bug.

This corrected version of the function should pass both failing tests and resolve the issues posted on GitHub.
