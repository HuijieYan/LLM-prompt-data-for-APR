The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to the case sensitivity of table names in the hive. The function checks whether a table exists by comparing the table name with the output of a command. However, the comparison is case-sensitive, which leads to the test failures highlighted in the error messages. 

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output needs to be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before the comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the updated version, the table name and the output of the command are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This modification ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

With this fix, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues, and the failing tests should pass.
