The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` does not correctly handle the case when the table name is not case-sensitive. The function doesn't account for the fact that the table name is case-insensitive in the Hive database, leading to incorrect comparisons and failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the buggy function to handle case-insensitive comparisons for the table name. This can be achieved by converting both the expected table name and the result from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)"""
                                  % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This version ensures that both the expected table name and the result from the Hive command are converted to lowercase before comparison. It also splits the result on newlines to handle the case where there are multiple tables in the result. This approach should fix the failing tests and handle case-insensitive comparisons for table existence in the Hive database.
