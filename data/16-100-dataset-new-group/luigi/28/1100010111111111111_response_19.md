The bug in the `table_exists` function is because it is not handling case sensitivity. The `table_exists` function is comparing the table name directly with the stdout, which might have a different case due to the case-insensitive nature of Hive.

The `test_table_exists` function is failing because it assumes that the returned value from the `table_exists` function should be `True` for the table name "MyTable" when it is actually `False` due to case sensitivity.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout to handle the case sensitivity issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing test cases. This correction also aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue #896.
