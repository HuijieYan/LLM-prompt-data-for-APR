The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly. The function checks if the provided table name is in the output from a Hive command, but it does not consider case sensitivity. This causes the function to fail when checking for tables with different capitalization.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now handle case insensitivity correctly and pass the failing test provided in the GitHub issue.
