The buggy function `table_exists` from the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file does not handle case insensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner. This causes an issue with the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` test functions, which are expecting the function to be case insensitive while the function is not. This issue is apparent from the two GitHub issues titled `hive table_exists should be case insensitive?` and `Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive`, where the problem is discussed and a possible resolution is being suggested.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not handle the case insensitivity of table names correctly. It simply checks if the table name is present in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without performing any case transformations. This results in a mismatch when comparing the table name with the output due to case differences. As a result, the function may return incorrect results when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to transform both the table name and the stdout to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison. This will ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function will first transform the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them using the `in` operator, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive. This change will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function behave as expected in the test functions.
