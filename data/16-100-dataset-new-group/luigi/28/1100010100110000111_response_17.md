The cause of the bug can be identified as the case sensitivity of the table names in the `table_exists` function. The function is not checking for case insensitivity when comparing the table name in the `stdout`, which leads to test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to compare the table name and `stdout` in a case-insensitive manner. This should resolve the issue and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive as per the GitHub issue.

The corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue.
