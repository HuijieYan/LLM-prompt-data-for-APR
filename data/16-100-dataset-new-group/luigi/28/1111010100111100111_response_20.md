The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class fails the test cases due to case sensitivity. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database.

The error occurs because the function does not consider case insensitivity when comparing the table name from the `stdout` with the input table name. This causes the test to fail, as it expects case insensitivity in table existence checks.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to ignore case differences when checking for table existence. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version converts both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive. This change aligns with the fix suggested in the GitHub issue #896, which addresses the case insensitivity problem in the `table_exists` function.
