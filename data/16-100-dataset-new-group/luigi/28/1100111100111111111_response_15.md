To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by comparing `table.lower()` with `stdout.lower()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. This also resolves the issues posted on GitHub regarding case insensitivity.
