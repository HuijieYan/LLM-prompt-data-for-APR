The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the logic in the if-else statements and how they handle the `stdout` variable. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not, but the current implementation doesn't seem to handle the condition correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the if-else statements. Based on the failing test cases, it appears that the issue is with how the function processes the `stdout` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            cmd = f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})'
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` variable by the newline character and check if the `table` exists in the resulting list. If partition information is provided, we construct the partition string and use it in the command to check for the existence of the table with the specified partition.

These changes should address the issues identified in the failing test cases and ensure that the expected input/output values are satisfied.
