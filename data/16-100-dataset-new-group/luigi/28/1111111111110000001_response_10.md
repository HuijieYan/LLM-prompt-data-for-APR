The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class, located in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function contains a conditional block and makes use of another function `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` within the same file. The bug occurs when the function is called with a table name and the function incorrectly returns `False` instead of `True`.

The cause of the bug is related to the use of the `run_hive_cmd` function within the `table_exists` function. The `run_hive_cmd` function does not return the expected value, causing the `table_exists` function to return `False` when it should return `True`. Additionally, the evaluation of whether the table exists by checking for the table name within the output of `run_hive_cmd` is not working properly.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function may need to be modified to return the correct output, and the evaluation of the output within the `table_exists` function may also need to be adjusted.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ",".join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` command is updated to correctly check if the table exists in the specified database. Additionally, the `partition_spec` function is removed as it was not used correctly in the original code.
