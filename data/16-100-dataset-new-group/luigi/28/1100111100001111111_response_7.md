The bug arises from the `table_exists` function failing to account for case sensitivity issues when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The bug exists in the conditional statements where the function checks the `stdout` for the presence of the table names, the comparison is case sensitive and can cause the function to return incorrect results in case there is a difference in capitalization between the provided table name and the existing table name in the database.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the table names extracted from `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the extracted table names from `stdout` to lowercase (using the `lower()` function), the function ensures the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports.
