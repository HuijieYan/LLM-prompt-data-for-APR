The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The GitHub issue #896 highlights this problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without converting the table name to lowercase. This leads to a failure in the tests when the case of the table name doesn't match the case of the table in the Hive database. The failing test cases and the expected runtime values provided indicate that the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. Additionally, it should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue. It performs a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.
