Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function, it appears that the bug involves case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the stdout. The GitHub issues suggest that the problem is related to table names being capitalized versus lower case underscored names, which causes the comparison to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case sensitivity when checking the existence of a table in the database. The implementation lacks a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output obtained from the database.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the comparison logic to use case-insensitive matching when checking for the existence of the table in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of table names and stdout is performed in case-insensitive manner using the `lower()` method. This modification addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that there are no failures due to differences in case between the table name and the output from the database.

The corrected version resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
