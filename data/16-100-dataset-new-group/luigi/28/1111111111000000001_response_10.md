The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is called and the condition check for the return value. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and then checks the output to determine if a table exists.

The potential error locations within the `table_exists` function are:
1. The first `if` condition checks if `stdout` exists and if the `table` is in `stdout`. This does not consider the possibility of extraneous characters or whitespace in the `stdout`.
2. The second condition checks if `stdout` exists, but the logic should check for the presence of the specific table within the `stdout`.

The cause of the bug is related to the way the stdout is being checked for table existence. It's possible that the `run_hive_cmd` function is returning extra characters or whitespace, causing the `stdout` check to fail even if the table exists.

To fix the bug, a strategy could involve modifying the conditions for checking the `stdout` and parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function more robustly to ensure accurate table existence checks.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')
```
In the corrected version, the `stdout` is split by newline character and the table existence is checked within the list of strings. This should provide a more accurate determination of the table's existence.
