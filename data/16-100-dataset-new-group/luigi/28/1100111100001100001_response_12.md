The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` functions.

The bug occurs when the partition is not None. The buggy function calls `run_hive_cmd` with a command that uses the `self.partition_spec(partition)` function to generate the partition spec string. However, the `self.partition_spec` method is not defined in the `HiveCommandClient` class, leading to a AttributeError when calling the function.

To fix this bug, the `self.partition_spec` method should be defined in the `HiveCommandClient` class, or an appropriate method that generates the partition spec string should be called.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Implementation of the partition_spec method

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec_str});')
            return bool(stdout)
```
