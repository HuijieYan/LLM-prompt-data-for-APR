The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the database. The bug seems to be related to the logic used to parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and determine if the table exists. 

The bug is likely in the `run_hive_cmd` function call, where the response is not being properly processed and checked. Additionally, the condition checking for `stdout` may not be sufficient to account for all possible output variations.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and include comprehensive checks for all possible responses to accurately determine if the table exists.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])  # Convert partition dict to string
        query = f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_string})"
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)

        return bool(stdout)  # Convert the presence of stdout to a Boolean value
```

This corrected version includes the correct handling of the `partition` parameter and constructs the `query` string to properly check for the existence of the table with the given partition. This version should address the issues identified in the failing test cases and accurately determine the existence of a table.
