The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, which may be in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail. This bug was reported on GitHub in issue #896, where it was suggested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the stdout from Hive to ensure it is case insensitive.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other functions ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will check for the lowercase version of the table name in the output from Hive, making it case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue. This change will resolve the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
