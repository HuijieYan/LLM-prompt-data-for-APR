Based on the analysis, the bug is caused by the way the stdout variable is being checked in the table_exists function. The buggy function returns the table existence based on the presence of the table name in the string output of the hive command, which is not a reliable approach.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for the existence of the exact table name in the stdout, rather than just a portion of the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Previous code remains as is

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            tables = [t.strip() for t in stdout.split('\n')]
    
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
            partitions = [p.strip() for p in stdout.split('\n')]
    
            if partition in partitions:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected code should now properly check for the existence of the table and its partitions, and it should pass the failing tests.
