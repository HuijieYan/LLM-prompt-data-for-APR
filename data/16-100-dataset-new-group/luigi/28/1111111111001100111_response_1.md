The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the fact that it is case sensitive, which causes it to fail when checking for table existence. The issue on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner. The solution involves converting both the table name and the STDOUT output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This change makes the comparison case insensitive, ensuring that the function will work correctly and pass the failing test cases.
