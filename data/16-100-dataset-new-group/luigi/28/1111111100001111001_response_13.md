The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is called when the `partition` parameter is not None. The result of running the hive command in this case is always returning as `True`, which is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with the wrong parameters. The correct command to check for the existence of a partition in Hive should be using the `SHOW PARTITIONS` statement directly, without calling the `self.partition_spec` method.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to construct the correct command to run for checking the existence of the table with or without partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition))
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

With this corrected version, the function now constructs the correct Hive command based on whether a partition is specified or not, and it checks for the existence of the table or partition accordingly.
