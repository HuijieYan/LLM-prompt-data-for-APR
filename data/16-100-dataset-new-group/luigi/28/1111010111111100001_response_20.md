The issue with the `table_exists` function seems to be caused by the logic that determines whether a table exists. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

The bug is likely present in the way the function checks the output of `run_hive_cmd` and returns `True` or `False` based on the presence of the table in the output.

It seems that the function expects a specific format of the output from `run_hive_cmd`, and this format is not being properly handled, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly parse the output from `run_hive_cmd` and determine the existence of the table based on that output. It should handle different cases and formats of the output to ensure it can accurately determine if the table exists.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        if stdout and table in stdout.split('\n'):
            return True
        
        if partition is not None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                    ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
        
        return False
``` 

This corrected version of the function first checks if the table is in the output of `run_hive_cmd` and returns `True` if it is found. Then, if there is a partition, it also checks for its existence in a similar way. If none of these checks pass, it returns `False`.
