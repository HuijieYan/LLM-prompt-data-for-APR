## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return stdout.strip() == table
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

Explanation:

1. The original buggy function has the following issues:
   - In the `table_exists` function, the first condition checks if `partition` is `None`, in the original buggy code the first condition `return stdout and table in stdout` may incorrectly return `True` even when the table does not exist due to the use of `and` rather than the correct condition. The correct condition should be checking if the table is in the `stdout`.
   - The second condition does not handle the `stdout` properly and does not check if `stdout` contains the table, it just returns `True` or `False` based on the presence or absence of `stdout`.
   
2. The corrected version of the function solves these issues by using the `strip` method to remove leading/trailing whitespaces and compares the `stdout` directly with the table name.

3. The corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.

4. The strategy for fixing the bug includes:
   - Using the `strip` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces in the `stdout`
   - Directly comparing the `stdout` with the table name for the first condition
   - Using the `bool` function to check if the `stdout` is not empty for the second condition
