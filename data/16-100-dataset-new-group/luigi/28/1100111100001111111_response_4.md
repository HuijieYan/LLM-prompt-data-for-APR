The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This is discussed in the GitHub issue "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?"

The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the table name with the output of the 'show tables' command without considering the case. As a result, when the table name's case does not match the case in the Hive database, the function returns false.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output of the 'show tables' command is case insensitive. This involves converting both the table name and the output to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other class functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        stdout = ""
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected function, both the table name and the stdout value are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, making the comparison case insensitive. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensures that the function behaves as expected in case insensitive situations.
