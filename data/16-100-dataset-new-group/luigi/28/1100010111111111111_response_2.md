The bug is in the `table_exists` function of the `luigi.contrib.hive.py`. The bug arises from the fact that the function does not account for case sensitivity.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not convert the table name to lowercase before performing the comparison with the `stdout`. This causes the comparison to fail for table names with different cases than what is present in stdout.

To fix the bug, the function should convert the table name to lowercase before performing the comparison with `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison. This will resolve the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the failing tests pass.
