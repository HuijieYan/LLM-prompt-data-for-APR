The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it returns `False` when it should return `True` in certain cases. This happens when the `stdout` value contains the table name, but it's incorrectly returning `False` because of the `if stdout` condition. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if the table name is present in `stdout` regardless of its position in the string, rather than simply checking if `stdout` is truthy. We also need to fix the condition where it returns `True` even if `stdout` contains the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly return `True` when the table exists in all cases specified.
