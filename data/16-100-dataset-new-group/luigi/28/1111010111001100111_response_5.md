The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive, and it fails to account for variations in table capitalization when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The failing test cases and the GitHub issue clearly indicate that this is the root cause of the problem. 

To fix the bug and make the function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command by converting both to lowercase. This way, any variations in capitalization will not affect the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issues posted on GitHub.
