It appears that the bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the logic used to check if a table exists in the database, especially when a partition is provided.

The issue arises from the use of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which may not be returning the expected result in all cases.

To fix this bug, the logic for checking table existence and handling partitions needs to be revised. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is working correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            # Use proper formatting for the partition parameter
            partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Check for the existence of partitions
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the case when a partition is provided and resolve the issues with table existence checks.
