The buggy function fails to make the comparison case insensitive, which causes the failing tests. The issue has been identified in two GitHub issues: "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The expected values for the failing tests indicate that the comparison between the table name and the output should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output should be made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function, with the comparison made case insensitive:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive, the corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, as well as resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
