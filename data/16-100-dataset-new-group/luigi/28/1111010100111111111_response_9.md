One potential error location in the buggy function is the comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner, which can lead to the test failing for table names that differ in case.

The bug occurs because the `table_exists` method does not handle case insensitivity, leading to test failures when comparing table names. 

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the tables in the `stdout` to lowercase before making the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case insensitivity and pass the failing tests mentioned.
