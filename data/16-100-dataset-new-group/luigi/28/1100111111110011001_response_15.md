The bug in the `table_exists` function is that when the `stdout` is not empty, the function always returns `True`, regardless of the actual contents of `stdout`. This causes the failing test cases because the expected results are not being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to properly check the contents of `stdout` before returning the value. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(stdout.split())  # check if stdout is not empty
```

The `table_exists` function has been modified to check the content of `stdout` properly and return the expected values based on the input parameters. Now, the corrected function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
