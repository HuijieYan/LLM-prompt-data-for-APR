The bug in the `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is that it doesn't account for case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This results in tests failing when comparing table names with differing cases.

The bug is caused by the function performing a case-sensitive check between the table name and the tables listed in the `stdout` variable. This causes the function to incorrectly determine whether the table exists or not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the tables listed in `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None
```

In the corrected version, the `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())` line performs a case-insensitive check by converting both the table name and the tables listed in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the function can correctly determine the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner.
