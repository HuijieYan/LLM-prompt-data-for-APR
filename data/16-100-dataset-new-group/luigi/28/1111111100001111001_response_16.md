The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the way the `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` functions are called and the way their results are handled.

The bug occurs when the `table_exists` function is called with a non-None `partition` parameter. The function attempts to retrieve the partition specification using `self.partition_spec(partition)` and pass it to the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, the result of `self.partition_spec(partition)` is not used correctly in the command passed to `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the command is constructed and utilize the result of `self.partition_spec(partition)` properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions here...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_condition = ' and '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            cmd = f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_condition})"
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we construct the partition condition string by joining key-value pairs from the `partition` dictionary. Then, we use this partition condition string to dynamically build the command to be passed to `run_hive_cmd`. After obtaining `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd`, we return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the table exists for the specified partition, and `False` otherwise.
