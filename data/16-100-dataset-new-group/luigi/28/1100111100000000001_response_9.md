# Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions

The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `partition_spec` function, which are also defined in the same file.

# Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

1. In the first branch of the `if` statement, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` may not be doing what was intended.
2. In the second branch of the `if` statement, the way the command is constructed using string formatting may be prone to errors.

# Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the related functions

The first branch of the `if` statement tries to confirm the existence of a table by checking if the table name is in the output of a Hive command. However, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` may not handle the case where `stdout` is an empty string correctly. 
The second branch of the `if` statement constructs a Hive command using string formatting, which may introduce syntax errors or result in an incorrect command being executed.

# Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

1. In the first branch, check for an empty `stdout` explicitly and handle it accordingly.
2. In the second branch, ensure that the Hive command is constructed correctly and the formatting placeholders are substituted appropriately.

# Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return bool(stdout) and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version explicitly checks for an empty `stdout` using `bool(stdout)` and constructs the Hive command using string formatting with appropriate placeholders. This should address the potential errors identified in the buggy function.
