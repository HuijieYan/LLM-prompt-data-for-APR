The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the names returned by Hive. This causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparisons to be case-insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the names returned by Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function will now handle case sensitivity properly and return correct results, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
