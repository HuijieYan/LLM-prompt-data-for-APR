The issue with the `table_exists` function seems to be that it does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the table name returned by Hive. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names have different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the returned table name from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")

            return bool(stdout)
```

The key change is to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive. This correction addresses the reported issue on GitHub as the function now checks stdout against table.lower(), making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

With this correction, the failing test cases should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
