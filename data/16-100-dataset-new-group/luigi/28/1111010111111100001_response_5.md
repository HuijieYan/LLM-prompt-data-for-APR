The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not properly handling the case where `stdout` is not empty. Instead of checking if the `table` is in `stdout`, it is directly returning `stdout` as a boolean. Additionally, the logic for checking if a partition exists is also incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly check for the existence of the table and partition.

The corrected version of the function is:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by lines and checks if the `table` exists in the list of tables. For the case of the partition, it directly checks if `stdout` is not empty to determine if the partition exists.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
