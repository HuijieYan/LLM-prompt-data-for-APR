The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case-insensitive table name comparisons in Hive. This results in failed tests when checking for existing tables with capitalized names.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison to make the function case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This updated version will ensure that the table name comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue with the failed tests mentioned in the GitHub issue.
