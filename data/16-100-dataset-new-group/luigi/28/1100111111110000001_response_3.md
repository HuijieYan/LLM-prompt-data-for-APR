The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function should return `True` when the table does exist, but it's currently returning `False` for existing tables. This is evident from the failing test, which is checking whether the table exists for different input values. The function is also checking for whether the table is in the `stdout`, which is inadequate for proper validation.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to check for the existence of the table in the output rather than checking the `stdout` directly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return "OK" in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}".format(database, table))
            return "OK" in stdout
```

In this corrected version, the function checks for whether "OK" exists in the `stdout`, which correctly indicates whether the table exists. This version should pass the failing tests.
