The buggy function `table_exists` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has a few potential error locations. 

1. The conditional statement for checking the existence of a table should return `True` if the table is found in the `stdout` and `False` if not found.
2. The use of `run_hive_cmd` and the formatting of the SQL queries could be causing issues in retrieving the correct `stdout`.

The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing it to fail the test cases. The function is not returning the expected values when the `run_hive_cmd` is mocked.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the `stdout` of the `run_hive_cmd` correctly and returns the expected boolean values for table existence.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version handles the stdout of the `run_hive_cmd` correctly and returns the expected boolean values for table existence.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases provided for the `apacheclient` as well.
