1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with test code, the GitHub issue.
The buggy function is the `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The test code is `test_table_exists` in the `test/contrib/hive_test.py` file. The GitHub issue mentions that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive when checking for existing tables in Hive.

2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
The potential error is in the comparison between the `table` and the `stdout` in the `table_exists` function. The comparison should be case insensitive.

3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test, the GitHub Issue information.
The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the table name retrieved from `stdout` is case sensitive. This causes the test to fail when it shouldn't, as Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names.

4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the table name retrieved from `stdout` needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both names to lowercase before comparison.

5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version.
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Comparison is now case insensitive
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
In the corrected version, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` has been made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison. This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and should make the `table_exists` function work as expected.
