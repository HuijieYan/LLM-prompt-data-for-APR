The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The test case fails when the table name has different capitalization in the function input and the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The code is not correctly handling the case sensitivity issue, causing the `table_exists` function to fail the test cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to ensure case insensitivity by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # existing code

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, we have made the comparison case insensitive and addressed the bug reported in GitHub issues #896 and #897.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the reported bug and pass the failing test cases.
