### Explanation
The issue occurs because the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, while the test cases are expecting case-insensitive checks for table existence. The issue has been identified and reported in GitHub Issue #896, and the proposed solution is to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive when checking the existence of tables.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to perform case-insensitive checks by converting both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparing them.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version of the function, the case-insensitive checks have been implemented, and it should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. This should also resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
