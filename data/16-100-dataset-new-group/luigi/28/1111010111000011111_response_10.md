The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive, which causes the test cases to fail when looking for tables with different capitalization than what is returned by Hive. This issue was logged on GitHub as Issue #896, and it describes the problem as well as a proposed fix.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive. We can accomplish this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue posted on GitHub and should make the function case insensitive as requested.
