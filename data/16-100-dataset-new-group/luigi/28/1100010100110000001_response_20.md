The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check whether a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and checks the output.

The potential error locations are:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function may not be returning the expected output, leading to a false negative or false positive result.
2. The string comparison `table in stdout` might be inaccurate, leading to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` is not handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly. In the provided failing test cases, the function returns "mytable" in the second test case, causing the string comparison `table in stdout` to fail, resulting in a false negative.

To fix the bug, we should handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function properly, accounting for any additional newlines or extra characters that may be present in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('show partitions {0} {1}'.format(table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` output is parsed using `split()` to ensure that the table name matches exactly without any extra characters or newlines. Additionally, the `stdout` is directly returned for partitioned tables, and the return value is explicitly converted to a boolean.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
