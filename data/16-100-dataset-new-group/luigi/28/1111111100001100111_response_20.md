Based on the runtime values and types of variables provided in the cases, as well as the GitHub issues, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity. The current implementation does not account for case differences between the table name and the output from the Hive command. This causes the function to fail when checking for table existence.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the table name and the stdout from the Hive command are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison to make the check for table existence case insensitive.
