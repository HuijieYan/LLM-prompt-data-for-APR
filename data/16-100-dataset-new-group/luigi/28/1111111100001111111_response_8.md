The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it is case sensitive and doesn't account for tables with different cases. The issue has been reported on GitHub, and it is clear that the problem lies with how the function compares the table names.

The bug arises from the comparison of the `table` parameter with the `stdout` values. The issue reported on GitHub also confirms that the function needs to be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

To fix the bug, you should modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` value to lowercase before comparison. You should then return the result of this comparison. This approach will ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of tables regardless of their case.

The corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the table name comparison case insensitive, the corrected function now satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to table existence being case insensitive.
