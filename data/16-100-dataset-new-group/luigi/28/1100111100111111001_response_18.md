The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the `stdout`. The function is not handling case insensitivity properly, which leads to incorrect results. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. We can do this by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
