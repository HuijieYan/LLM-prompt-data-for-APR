The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing tests due to case sensitivity issues. The issue is that the function does not handle case-insensitive table names correctly. The test case where the table name is provided as "MyTable" is failing because the function does not account for case differences in the table name while checking if the table exists.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to handle case-insensitive table names correctly. The function should convert the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, the table name is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before checking if it exists in the `stdout`. This change makes the comparison case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, the reported GitHub issue should be addressed with this fix.
