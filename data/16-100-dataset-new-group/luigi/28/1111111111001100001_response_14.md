The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the else section where the `run_hive_cmd` is called with a multi-line string. The output of this command should be checked if it contains any partition info, but the buggy code only checks if the output is non-empty, causing it to return True even when the partition info is not found.

To fix this bug, we need to check for the presence of partition info in the stdout. Additionally, we should modify the `run_hive_cmd` function to return the correct partition info string in the mocked test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {db}; show partitions {tbl} partition({part})"""
                              .format(db=database, tbl=table, part=self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(partition in entry for entry in stdout.split('\n')) if stdout else False  
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
