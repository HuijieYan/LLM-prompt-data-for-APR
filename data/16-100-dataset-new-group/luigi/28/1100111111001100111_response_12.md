The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it fails to be case insensitive when checking for table existence. This is the source of the failing tests. The bug is also related to the GitHub issue #896 which is about making `table_exists` case insensitive. The issue was raised because the function doesn't handle case insensitivity properly. 

The buggy function should compare the table name in a case insensitive manner while checking for its existence in the Hive database.

To fix the bug, I will modify the `table_exists` function to check for the existence of the table in a case insensitive manner. This can be done by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before doing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using `lower()` method before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive.

With this fix, the failing test should pass, and the issue raised on GitHub should be resolved.
