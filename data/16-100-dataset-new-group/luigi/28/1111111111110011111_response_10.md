The bug in the `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class seems to be related to case insensitivity. The function does not perform case-insensitive checks when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This causes the test cases for `table_exists` to fail when checking for existence of tables with different case formats.

To fix this issue, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the command output to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expectations outlined in the given test cases. Additionally, it addresses the issue in the GitHub posts related to case insensitivity.
