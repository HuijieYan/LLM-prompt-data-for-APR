Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of table names in the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive.
2. The `table_exists` function does not account for case differences in the table name when checking for its existence.

Explanation of the bug:
The `table_exists` function does not account for case differences when checking for the existence of a table. This can lead to false negatives when the table name's case does not match exactly with the case of the table name in the database.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparison.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue.

This fix will address the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.
