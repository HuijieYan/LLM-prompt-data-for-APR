The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not properly handle the case of checking for table existence with a given partition. The function correctly constructs the hive command and captures the standard output, but it doesn't properly check the standard output to determine if the table exists in the specified database and partition.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly check the standard output for the presence of the table when no partition is specified, and for the presence of the partition when a partition is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the corrected version, we use the `strip` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the standard output before performing the comparison. This ensures a more robust check for the presence of the table or partition in the output.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
