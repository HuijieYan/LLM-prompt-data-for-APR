The buggy function `table_exists` is failing several test cases, especially when the table name is in capital letters. This issue was raised on GitHub with the title "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The issue suggests that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues. The failing test cases and expected input/output values have been provided.

The bug is caused by the function not being case insensitive when comparing the table name against the `stdout` returned from `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix this bug, the buggy function `table_exists` needs to be modified to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to handle the case insensitivity.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, all the provided test cases would pass, and the function would behave as expected, satisfying the GitHub issue regarding case insensitivity.
