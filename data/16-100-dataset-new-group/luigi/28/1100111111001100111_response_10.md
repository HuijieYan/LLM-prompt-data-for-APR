The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive, causing the tests to fail when checking for tables with different cases. Based on the GitHub issue, the expected behavior is for the function to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercased table name with the lowercased stdout when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function will now compare the lowercased table name with the lowercased stdout, making it case insensitive when checking for table existence. This aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
