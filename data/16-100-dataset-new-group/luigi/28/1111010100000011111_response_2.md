The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to determine whether a table exists in a given database. However, it has a bug where it fails to consider case sensitivity when checking if the table exists. This was reported as an issue on GitHub, and it has been suggested that the function should be case insensitive when checking the existence of tables.

The bug occurs because the function directly compares the table name with the table names obtained from `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. This causes issues when the table names in the database are in a different case than the one provided to the function.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the input table name and the table names obtained from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the table names in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will convert both the input `table` and the table names obtained from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, making it case insensitive. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the function works correctly in all cases.
