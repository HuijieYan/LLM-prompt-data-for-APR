The potential error in the buggy function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `partition_spec` function are called from the same file, but they belong to different classes. 

The cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called correctly in the `table_exists` function, and there is a potential issue with the string formatting in the else condition, where the `partition_spec` function is called.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called as a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class, and the string formatting in the else condition should be corrected to call the `partition_spec` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def run_hive_cmd(self, hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
        # Correct implementation of the run_hive_cmd function
        pass
    
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Correct implementation of the partition_spec function
        pass
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` are now called as methods of the `HiveCommandClient` class, and the string formatting in the else condition has been corrected to call the `partition_spec` method. Additionally, the return statement in the else condition has been simplified for readability.
