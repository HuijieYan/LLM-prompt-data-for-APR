The buggy function is `table_exists` which is not case insensitive, causing the test case to fail when checking for an existing table. The related function `run_hive_cmd` is also causing issues with the standard output. The GitHub issue #896 and the related test functions indicate that the table_exists function is not handling case insensitivity properly.

The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does not account for case insensitivity in the `stdout`, causing the test to fail when checking for an existing table.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, making the function case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now converts both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the function is case insensitive and will pass the failing test case.
