After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test and the GitHub issue, it is clear that the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The bug causes the test to fail because the function does not account for case differences between the table name and the output from Hive.

To fix the bug, we should modify the table_exists function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we modify the comparison in the table_exists function to use lowercase versions of both the table name and the stdout. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub regarding case insensitivity in table_exists function.
