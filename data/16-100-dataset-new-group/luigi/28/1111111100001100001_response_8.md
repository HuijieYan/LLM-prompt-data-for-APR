The bug in the `table_exists` function is that in the second part of the if-else statement, the `self.partition_spec(partition)` call is not properly concatenated with the rest of the Hive command.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `self.partition_spec(partition)` call returns a string that can be concatenated to the rest of the Hive command.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join([f'{k}={v}' for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition
                            ({3})""".format(database, table, table, partition_str))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, we took the `partition` parameter, converted it to a string `partition_str`, and then concatenated it with the rest of the Hive command in the `run_hive_cmd` call.
