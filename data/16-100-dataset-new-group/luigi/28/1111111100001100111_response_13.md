The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not consider case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This discrepancy causes the test cases to fail when comparing table names with different cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, `table.lower()` is used to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with `stdout.lower()`, making the comparison case-insensitive. This resolves the bug and aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
