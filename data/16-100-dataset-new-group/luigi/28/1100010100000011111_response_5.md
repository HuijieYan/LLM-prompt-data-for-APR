The buggy function `table_exists` is currently not case insensitive and is causing issues with table names that are in a different case than the expected input. 

The bug is caused by the function not converting the table name to lowercase when checking for its existence in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the table name should be converted to lowercase and then checked against the lowercase `stdout` to make the function case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version converts both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make the function case insensitive, which satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
