The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case insensitivity when comparing the table names in the stdout with the input `table` parameter. This results in test failures due to the incorrect comparison of table names with different cases.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the input `table` parameter and the table names in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    ...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table names, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug reports.

This corrected version of the function will pass the failing tests and resolve the issues reported in the GitHub threads.
