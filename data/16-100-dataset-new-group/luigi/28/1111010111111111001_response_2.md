The bug in the provided function is that it does not check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner. This causes the failing tests, as they expect the function to return True for a table that exists, regardless of the case used when calling the function.

To fix the bug, we should modify the implementation to perform a case-insensitive check for the table existence.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Perform case-insensitive check
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Return the boolean value directly
```

The updated implementation includes a case-insensitive comparison for table existence and a simplified return statement in the second part of the function.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the previously failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
