The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` tests. The bug is negatively affecting the case sensitivity of comparing table names in the Hive database. The issue on GitHub (#896) points out that the function should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With the updated function, the bug should be fixed, and both the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` tests should pass. This change also aligns with the suggestions in the GitHub issue and resolves the case insensitivity problem with table names.
