To address the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the output of the table existence check case insensitive. This fix will ensure that tables with names in different cases will be correctly identified.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            table_lower = table.lower()
            tables_lower = [t.lower() for t in stdout.split("\n")]
            return table_lower in tables_lower
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

The key fix in the `table_exists` function is to make the table name comparison case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the tables in the output to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the table names.

This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function works as expected in all relevant test cases.
