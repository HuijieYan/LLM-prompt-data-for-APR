### Analyze the buggy function
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in the database. However, the function appears to be case sensitive, which is causing the failing test. The GitHub issue #896 suggests that the function should be case insensitive.

### Potential error locations
The potential error is in the comparison of the table name with the table names returned from the `stdout` in both the `if` and `else` branches.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the table names returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. As a result, the test fails when the capitalization doesn't match.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by converting both the table name and the table names returned by `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before the comparison to ensure case insensitivity.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the value in `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison is made. This change ensures case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table.
