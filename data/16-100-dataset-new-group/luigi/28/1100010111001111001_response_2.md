## Correction

The issue with the buggy function is that the code is not properly handling the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is expecting specific strings in the stdout, but it is not handling the different cases properly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {}; show partitions {} partition {}""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected function now properly splits the stdout using newline characters and checks for the presence of the table name in the output. It also checks for the truthiness of the stdout for the partition case.

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
