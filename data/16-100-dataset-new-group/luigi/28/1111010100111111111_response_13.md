The buggy function is the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database, using `hive` invocations.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case sensitivity properly. Hive is case insensitive, and will return table names in lower case, but the function does not account for this. As a result, the function fails to correctly check for the existence of a table when the case differs.

A strategy to fix the bug is to modify the function to check if the lower case version of the table name exists in the standard output from the Hive command. This will make the table existence check case insensitive, in line with the expected behavior.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function now correctly checks if the lower case version of the table name exists in the standard output, making the table existence check case insensitive. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing tests.
