The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional statement for the `stdout` variable when `partition` is not None. The call to `self.partition_spec(partition)` is not producing the expected format for the `stdout` comparison.

The suggested fix is to check the formatting of the `stdout` string based on the mock data provided, and ensure that it matches the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ",".join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should address the issues observed in the failing test cases.
