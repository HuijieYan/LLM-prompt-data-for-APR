The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing the test cases to fail when checking for table existence using different cases. This is further confirmed by the GitHub issue, which suggests that table names are returned as lowercase in the stdout.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive by comparing `table.lower()` with `stdout.lower()`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected function should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue posted on GitHub.
