The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by a case sensitivity issue, where the `table` parameter is not being compared in a case-insensitive manner with the `stdout`. This causes the test to fail when the table name is provided in different cases than the expected output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to compare the `table` parameter with the `stdout` in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` and `stdout` strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. This also resolves the GitHub issues #896 and #897 related to the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
