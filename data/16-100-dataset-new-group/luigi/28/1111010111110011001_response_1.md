The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition to check if `stdout` is not empty is not implemented correctly. It should check if the table name is present in the stdout, but it is currently checking if stdout is not None, which is leading to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if the table name is present in the output. Also, we need to modify the condition for the case where `partition` is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function now checks if the `table` is present in the `stdout` and returns the corresponding boolean value. This corrected function should pass all the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
