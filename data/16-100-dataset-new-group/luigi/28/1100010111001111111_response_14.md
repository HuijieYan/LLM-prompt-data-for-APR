The buggy function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This is causing the failing tests, as the function does not take the case of the table name into account when comparing it with the stdout from the Hive command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive by converting the table name to lowercase before comparison. We can achieve this by using the `lower()` method on the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the table name and the stdout in a case-insensitive manner, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
