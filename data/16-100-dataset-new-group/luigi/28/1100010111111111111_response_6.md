The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle the case insensitivity of table names in Hive. This is reflected in the failing test cases where the table name is returned in lowercase, leading to assertions failing.

### Bug in the function:
The bug is in the condition where the function checks if the table name exists in the `stdout` from the Hive command. This comparison is case-sensitive, causing the function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and `stdout` should be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case insensitivity and pass the failing test cases. This fix also addresses GitHub issue #896.
