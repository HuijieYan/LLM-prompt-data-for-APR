The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic for checking if a table exists in the database, especially when a partition is specified. In the test cases, the function is expected to return True if the table exists and False if it doesn't.

The bug occurs in the `else` block of the `table_exists` function, where it constructs a command to check for the existence of a partitioned table in the specified database. The bug is causing the function to always return True, regardless of whether the partition actually exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check in the `else` block to correctly determine if the partition exists based on the output received.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_cmd))
        return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty, indicating partition exists
```

With this fix, the function correctly checks for the existence of partitions and returns True only if the partition exists in the specified table and database.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
