The buggy function `table_exists` seems to have a logic error where it checks for the presence of a table in the stdout of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It also has an issue with using the `self.partition_spec` function to construct the command for checking the existence of a partitioned table.

The bug is likely in the conditional statements handling the presence or absence of partitions. The buggy function does not handle the case where the table is not found correctly, leading to a false positive or false negative result.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `table_exists` function need to be re-evaluated. Additionally, the logic for constructing the command when a partition is specified needs to be reviewed, as it is currently not functioning as expected.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_values = ",".join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_values});")
            return bool(stdout)
```

The fix involves correcting the construction of the command for checking the existence of a partitioned table and updating the conditional statements to handle the presence or absence of tables and partitions correctly.
