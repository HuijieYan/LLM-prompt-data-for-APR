The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes issues when the table names are defined with different cases than what is returned by Hive. To fix this, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before checking for the existence of the table.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the fixed function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lower case using the `lower()` method before checking for the table's existence. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports.
