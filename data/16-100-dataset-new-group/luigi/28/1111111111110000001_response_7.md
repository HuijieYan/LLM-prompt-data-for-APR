## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected version of the function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

The bug in the original `table_exists` function is caused by not splitting the stdout by new line character, thus resulting in the incorrect check of table existence. Additionally, the return value of the function was not consistent. The corrected version properly splits the stdout by a new line character and returns a boolean value based on the condition.

The corrected `table_exists` function should resolve the issue in the failing test cases.
