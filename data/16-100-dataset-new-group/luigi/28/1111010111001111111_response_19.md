The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not consider case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The bug is causing the failing test cases to return incorrect results and is related to GitHub issue #896.

The bug causes the function to not always return the correct result when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This is due to the function not converting the table name to lowercase for comparison with the output from the Hive command, which is always returned in lowercase. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before performing the comparison with the output from the Hive command. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and will ensure that the function returns the correct result.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now return the correct results and pass the failing test cases, while also addressing the case insensitivity issue mentioned in GitHub issue #896.
