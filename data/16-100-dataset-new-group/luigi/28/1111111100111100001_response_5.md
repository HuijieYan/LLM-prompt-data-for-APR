The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the database. It incorrectly assumes that the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function will always begin with "OK\n" followed by the table name when the table exists. However, this assumption is not valid in all cases, for example, when the table name is not in the output as a separate line.

The bug fix strategy is to modify the logic of how the function checks for the existence of a table. Instead of relying on a specific format of the output from `run_hive_cmd`, the function should directly check if the table name is present in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # simply return the boolean value of the stdout
```

This corrected version directly returns the boolean value of `stdout` for both the cases, removing the unnecessary if-else logic. This will correctly check for the existence of the table in the database based on the actual output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
