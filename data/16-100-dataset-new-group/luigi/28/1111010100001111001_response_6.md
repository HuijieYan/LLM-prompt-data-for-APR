The bug in the code seems to be related to the logic of checking if a table or partition exists in the Hive database. It's not handling the case when the table or partition doesn't exist correctly.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty result correctly. The current implementation only returns the result of the `run_hive_cmd` call. This is incorrect because an empty result should not always be interpreted as "table exists" or "partition exists."

A possible fix for this bug would be to check if the stdout is empty and then return False if it is, instead of just checking for truthiness.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This version checks if the stdout is empty before returning the result. If it's empty, it returns False, indicating that the table or partition does not exist. Otherwise, it returns the result of the comparison or the truth value of the stdout.
