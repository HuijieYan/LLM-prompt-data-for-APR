The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly handling the case when there is no partition specified. The logic within the function is causing the first test to fail.

The issue seems to be on this line of the `table_exists` function: 
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
```
and here:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```

The bug appears to be that when the `run_hive_cmd` function is called without a specified partition, the logic expects the response to contain the table name. However, it appears that `run_hive_cmd` never returns the table name, which is causing the first test to fail.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `run_hive_cmd` function to return the table name. Additionally, we can modify the condition to check for the existence of the table in the response from `run_hive_cmd`.

Here's the modified `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should now handle both cases and pass the failing test.
