The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a couple of potential error locations:
1. The conditional statements for checking the existence of a table and its partitions might not be correct.
2. The usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function might not be properly handling the return values.

The bug is causing the `test_table_exists` test to fail. When the `table_exists` function is called with the name of the table, it is incorrectly returning `False` in the first case where the table actually exists. Similarly, in the case where the partition information is provided, the function is returning `True` even when the partition does not exist. This behavior indicates a bug in the logic of the `table_exists` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `table_exists` function to correctly determine if a table or its partitions exist. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function handles the output properly and returns the expected values.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table, table))
    
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} like "{2}" partition ({3});'.format(database, table, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `show tables` and `show partitions` commands are formatted correctly to check for the existence of the table and its partitions. Additionally, the output of `run_hive_cmd` is split and processed to return the expected values.
