The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable. The function is returning the `stdout` itself, which is an empty string or contains the table name. This is not a boolean value, hence the comparisons are not working as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check if `stdout` contains the table name or partitions and return True or False accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
