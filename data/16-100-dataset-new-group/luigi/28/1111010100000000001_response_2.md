The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. In the `else` block, there is a missing space between `show partitions` and `%s`.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being used but it's not defined within the class.

The bug in the function is caused by the missing space in the `else` block, and also the missing definition of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug:
1. Add a space between `show partitions` and `%s` in the `else` block.
2. Define the `run_hive_cmd` function within the class or import it from another module.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, I assumed that the `run_hive_cmd` function is defined within the class as an instance method. If it's defined in a different class or module, it should be imported or accessed accordingly.
