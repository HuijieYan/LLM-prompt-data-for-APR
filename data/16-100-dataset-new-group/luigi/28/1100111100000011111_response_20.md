The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. This causes the function to incorrectly report the existence of a table when the case does not match.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and fixes the bug.
