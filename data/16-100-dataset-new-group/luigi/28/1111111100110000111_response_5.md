The bug in the 'table_exists' function is causing the test case to fail due to case sensitivity of the table names. The bug is causing the function to not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

The function is comparing the table name directly without considering case insensitivity, which causes the test cases to fail when the table name has a different case than expected. The issue is well-documented on GitHub with issue number #896 and proposes a fix to make the 'table_exists' function case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the 'table_exists' function needs to be modified to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the check is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the 'table_exists' function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive and resolving the failing test cases.

This fix addresses the issue raised in GitHub, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases related to table existence in the Hive database.
