The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the `stdout` with the input table name. As per the GitHub issue #896, the function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. The current implementation does not consider the case of the table name, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison operation in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive when checking for the table name in the `stdout`. We can achieve this by converting both the input table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the input table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive, resolving the failing tests and addressing the GitHub issue #896.
