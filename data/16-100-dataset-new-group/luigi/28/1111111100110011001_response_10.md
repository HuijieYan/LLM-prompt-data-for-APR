The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way it handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks for the existence of a table in the 'stdout' variable.

The function `run_hive_cmd` is used to execute hive commands and return the output. It's likely that the bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the output from this function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `stdout` variable captures the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly, and then check for the existence of the table within this output. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the output contains the table name but has additional content.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
            if partition_query:
                stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_query))
                return stdout and table in stdout
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the `partition_query` is not empty before executing the `run_hive_cmd` function. Then, we return `True` if the table is found in the `stdout` variable, and `False` otherwise.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
