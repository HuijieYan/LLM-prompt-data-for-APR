## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The cause of the bug:
The buggy function `table_exists` failed to check for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner. This resulted in failing test cases where the table exists but with different cases.

The strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by converting both the table and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

The corrected version of the function checks for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This should resolve the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values as well as fix the issue posted on GitHub.
