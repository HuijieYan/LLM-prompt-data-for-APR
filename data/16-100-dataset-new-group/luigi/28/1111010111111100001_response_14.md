The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the conditionals used to determine the existence of a table. The function logic is not handling the different cases properly, leading to failed assertions in the test cases.

The issue seems to be with the comparison of the stdout with the table name, as well as the handling of the `partition` parameter.

An approach to fix the bug could be to refactor the conditional statements and the handling of the `partition` parameter in order to correctly determine the existence of the table.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return len(stdout.split('\n')) > 1  # Check if there is more than one partition
```

By splitting the stdout and checking for the presence of the table in the output, the function should now accurately determine the existence of the table. Additionally, when checking for partitions, the function counts the number of lines in the output to determine the existence of partitions.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
