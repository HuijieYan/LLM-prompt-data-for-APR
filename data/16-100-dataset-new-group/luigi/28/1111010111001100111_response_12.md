The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity, which causes the test cases to fail when checking for existing tables with different cases. This is reflected in the GitHub issue with the title "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The proposed fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By using the `lower()` method to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, the function will now be case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. This should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
