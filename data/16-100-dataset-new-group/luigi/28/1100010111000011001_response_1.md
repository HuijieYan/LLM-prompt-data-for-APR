## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table  # Check if table is in the list of tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ""  # Check if partitions exist
```

In the original function, the first check for the existence of a table could return a string that contains the table's name but also other text ("OK\nmytable"). The function does not correctly handle this case, and therefore fails the test. Additionally, the second check does not handle the case when the stdout is not empty and always returns True.

The corrected version of the function uses the `strip` method to remove leading/trailing whitespace and then checks the stdout to see if it matches the expected table name or if it is not empty in the case of partitions.

By applying the `strip` method to `stdout`, the corrected function ensures that only the relevant table name is compared and it handles the partition case correctly by checking if stdout is not empty.

The corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
