The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class from the luigi.contrib.hive module is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes issues when tables are defined with capitalized names, as Hive returns them in lowercase and the test fails. The GitHub issue has been raised to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive. We can check if `table.lower()` is in `stdout.lower()` to handle the case sensitivity issue. This change should make the function insensitive to the case of the table name and resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner. Additionally, we can simplify the `else` block by directly returning `bool(stdout)` to check if `stdout` contains any data. This addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post and makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
