The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect SQL query construction in the `table_exists` function.
2. Incorrect indentation within the `table_exists` function.
3. Bad conditional statements that do not correctly check for table existence.

The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` always returns True if `stdout` is not empty. This caused the test cases to fail because the expected results are not being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the SQL query to properly check for the existence of the table and fix the conditional statements to return the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))

        return table in stdout.split("\n")  # Check if the table is in the list of tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty and return True if it's not, otherwise return False
    
```

In this corrected version, we have fixed the SQL queries to properly check for the existence of the table or partitions, and used proper conditional statements to return the correct result.

With this corrected version, the failing test cases should now pass without any assertion errors.
