To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive, as indicated in the GitHub issue. The comparison should check if the table name in lowercase is present in the stdout in lowercase.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
