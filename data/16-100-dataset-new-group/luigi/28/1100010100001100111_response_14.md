The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes issues when the table names are in different cases than what is returned from Hive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the function will convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison. This will address the issue reported in the GitHub post and make the `table_exists` function more robust.
