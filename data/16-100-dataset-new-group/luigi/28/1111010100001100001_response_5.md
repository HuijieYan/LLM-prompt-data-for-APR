The potential issue in the provided code is with the `run_hive_cmd` function that is used to execute Hive commands. It seems like the function may not be correctly capturing the output from the Hive commands.

The bug causes the function `table_exists` to return incorrect results. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database, and if a specific partition exists within that table. However, it fails to accurately determine the existence of the table or partition due to the issues with `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be checked and potentially revised to ensure it correctly captures the output from the Hive queries.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition})')
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

In this corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` is called with the correct Hive commands and should now correctly capture the output. The `if stdout` condition is simplified by directly returning the boolean value of `stdout`, ensuring that the function returns the correct result whether the table or partition exists.
