The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling the stdout correctly when checking for the existence of a table in the database. The current implementation is not properly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checking if the table exists. 

The bug is occurring because the function `run_hive_cmd` is not returning the expected value in the `stdout` variable, causing the condition `stdout and table in stdout` to fail and leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to handle the stdout variable properly and check for the existence of the table based on the expected output of the `run_hive_cmd`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = ', '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k,v) for k,v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_query))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, when `partition` is None, the function runs the command "use {database}; show tables in {table}" and checks if the table exists in the output. When `partition` is not None, it constructs a partition query and runs the command "use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_query})", then returns a boolean based on whether the stdout is empty or not.

This corrected version should now handle the stdout properly and check for the existence of the table in the database as expected.
