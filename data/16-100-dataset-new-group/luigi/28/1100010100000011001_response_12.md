## Correction

The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition for checking the presence of the table is not correctly handled and the formatting of the Hive commands is not consistent. The `run_hive_cmd` function is called without being defined, which is another potential bug.

To fix this, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be defined, and the if-else condition for checking the presence of the table needs to be updated. The Hive command formatting should also be consistent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table, database))
        return 'OK' in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return 'OK' in stdout
```

In this corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code, and it is used to execute the Hive commands. The if-else condition is updated to check if `'OK'` is present in the output of the Hive commands, which indicates the presence of the table in the database.

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values for the given cases.
