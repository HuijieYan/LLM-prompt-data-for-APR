The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle the case when the `run_hive_cmd` function returns `OK` as expected. The function only checks for the existence of the table in the `stdout` and returns `False` if it doesn't find the table, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the `run_hive_cmd`'s output contains the table name and return `True` in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return 'OK' in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return 'OK' in stdout
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected outputs.
