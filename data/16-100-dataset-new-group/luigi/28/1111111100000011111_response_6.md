The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The bug lies in the comparison of the table name with the tables returned from the Hive command. The comparison is case-sensitive, causing issues with tables that are defined with capitalized names.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the case-sensitive comparison of the table name with the output from Hive, which may have lowercase names. This causes the function to inaccurately determine if a table exists or not.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase, and then performing the comparison.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing a case-insensitive comparison to determine if the table exists or not. The fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensures that the function behaves as expected under all test cases provided.
