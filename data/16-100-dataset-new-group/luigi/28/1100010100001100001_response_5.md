The bug in the provided function appears to be in the conditional statements that check the presence of 'table' or 'partition' in the 'stdout' variable. In Case 2 and Case 5, the function fails to correctly identify the table name in the 'stdout' string, while it correctly identifies it in Case 1 and Case 4. 

The issue stems from how the 'show tables/partitions' command output is being handled. The 'show tables' command in Case 1 and Case 4 returns just the table name, while in Case 2 and Case 5 it returns both 'OK' and the table names. This inconsistency causes the function to incorrectly identify table existence.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the 'stdout' variable to check for the presence of the table name when no partition is specified. Additionally, when a partition is specified, we need to adjust how the 'stdout' variable is checked to accurately determine the presence of the partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(partition in part for part in partitions)
```

In the corrected version, we split the 'stdout' variable into a list of tables or partitions and then check for the presence of the specific table or partition. This ensures that the function accurately determines the existence of the table or partition regardless of the format of the 'stdout' variable.
