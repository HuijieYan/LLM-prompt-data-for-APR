The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test cases. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence in the database, as Hive returns table names in lower case. The fix involves comparing the table name with the lower case version of the output.

To correct the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to use the lower case of the table name when checking the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lower case before comparison, the table existence check will be case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the reported issue.
