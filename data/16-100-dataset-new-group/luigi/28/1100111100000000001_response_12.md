## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a database, and if a partition is given, it checks if that partition exists for the specified table.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function might not be returning the expected output.
2. The format used in the string substitution might not be correct, leading to errors in the SQL query.
3. The logic for checking the existence of the table and partition might not be correct.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug could be caused by incorrect SQL queries being formed, improper logic for checking the existence of the table and partition, or unexpected behavior from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the `run_hive_cmd` function to ensure it is returning the expected output.
2. Review the SQL queries formed in the `table_exists` function to ensure they are correctly formatted.
3. Verify the logic for checking the existence of the table and partition.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```
