The root cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not case insensitive, resulting in failed tests when the case of the input table name does not match the case of the table name in the output of the Hive command.

The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the input table name and the table names in the output of the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected `table_exists` function uses the `lower` method to convert both the input table name and the table names in the output to lowercase, and then performs a case-insensitive comparison. This change allows the function to identify the existence of a table regardless of its case.

By making this change, the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the reported GitHub issues.
