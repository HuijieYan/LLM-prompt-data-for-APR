## Analysis:
The `table_exists` function is intended to check if a table exists in a specified database with optional partition information. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions to gather the required information to perform the check.

## Identifying potential errors:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is called within the `table_exists` function, but it is not imported or referenced locally within the `table_exists` function.
2. The string formatting for the command in the else block appears to be incorrect.

## Cause of the bug:
The `run_hive_cmd` function is not correctly imported or referenced, leading to a NameError. Additionally, the formatting of the command string in the else block is incorrect, which could lead to errors in the Hive command execution.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `run_hive_cmd` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class or directly reference it from its module.
2. Fix the formatting of the Hive command string to ensure it is properly constructed.

## Corrected version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{0}="{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```
