The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the tables returned from the Hive command. The issue explains that when checking for an existing table with a capitalized name, the Hive output will return the table in lowercase, causing the test to fail. The suggested fix is to make the comparison case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we should modify the buggy function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            table_lower = table.lower()
            return any(table_lower in partition.lower() for partition in stdout.split('\n'))
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the partitions to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case insensitive. This resolves the issue reported in the GitHub posts.
