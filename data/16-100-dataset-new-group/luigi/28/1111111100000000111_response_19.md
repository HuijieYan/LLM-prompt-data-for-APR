The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive, leading to issues when checking for existing tables with capitalized names. The bug was reported in GitHub issue #896, where it was suggested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    # ... (other functions)
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, we use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `stdout`, making the comparison case insensitive. This change will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
