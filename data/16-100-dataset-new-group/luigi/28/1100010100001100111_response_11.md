The bug in the function `table_exists` stems from a case sensitivity issue when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database. The function currently compares the table name directly to the output from Hive, leading to inconsistencies due to differences in capitalization. 

To fix this bug, the comparison should be made case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This change ensures that both the table name and the Hive output are compared in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub threads.
