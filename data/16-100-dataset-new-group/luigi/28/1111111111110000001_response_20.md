The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to incorrect logic. The primary issue is with the `if partition is None` condition. When the condition is met, it should check if the stdout contains any table, meaning it should return True if there is a table in the stdout, and False if there isn't. However, the current implementation is doing the opposite.

Additionally, the second part of the function is making a call to `run_hive_cmd` with incorrect parameters and incorrectly checking the response. It needs to use the `partition_spec` method correctly to generate the right partition information.

To fix the bug, we will swap the return logic within the `if partition is None` condition and refine the logic for the second part of the function to construct the correct command and check its response.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)  # Consider non-empty strings as True
```

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
