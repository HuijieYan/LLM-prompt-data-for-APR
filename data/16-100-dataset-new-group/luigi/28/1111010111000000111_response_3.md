The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity properly, leading to failing test cases and the GitHub issues mentioned. The issue arises from the fact that Hive is case insensitive, so the function should be modified to handle this properly.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly in a case-insensitive environment. The fix should address the issue reported in GitHub and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # The corrected version of the function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now handle case insensitivity properly and pass the failing test cases. It also resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
