The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not correctly handle the case when the `run_hive_cmd` function returns an empty string.

The function should return False when `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty string, rather than returning the actual value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the case when `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty string and should pass the failing tests.
