## The corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

## Explanation:
The buggy function `table_exists` has potential error locations in the string formatting and in the conditional statements. The primary cause of the bug is the incorrect usage of the `show tables` and `show partitions` commands, as well as the incorrect if-else logic.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `show tables` command to use `show tables in` with the specific database name.
2. Use proper string formatting for the hive commands and parameters.
3. Use the `bool()` function to explicitly convert the `stdout` value to a boolean.

By incorporating these changes, the corrected version of the function will accurately check for the existence of a table or partition in the specified database.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and provides a more robust and accurate implementation.
