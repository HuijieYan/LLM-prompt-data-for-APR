The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the condition checking and formatting of the `stdout` variable. In the two test cases, the condition to check if the table exists in the database is not being evaluated correctly, leading to an incorrect return value.

The problem seems to be in the conditional statements where the `stdout` variable is being checked. Specifically, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` in the first case and the condition `if stdout` in the second case are not being properly evaluated.

It appears that the `stdout` variable is not being formatted correctly, leading to an incorrect result when checking the existence of the table.

To fix the bug, the formatting of the `stdout` variable needs to be handled correctly, and the conditions for checking the table existence need to be updated.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_filter = " and ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});".format(database, table, partition_filter))
            return bool(stdout)  # Returning the truthiness of stdout
```

In this corrected version, the `stdout` variable is properly formatted to include the partition filter if a partition is provided. Additionally, the conditions for checking the existence of the table have been updated and simplified for better readability.
