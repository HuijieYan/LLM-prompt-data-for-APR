The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case-sensitivity in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive commands. This causes the function to return incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table in Hive, especially when the table name is capitalized and the output from Hive is in lowercase.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive to be case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions in the class
    # ...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is made case-insensitive by converting both strings to lowercase using the `lower()` method before checking for existence.

This change addresses the GitHub issue about making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive and ensures that the function returns the correct results regardless of the case of the table name and the output from Hive.
