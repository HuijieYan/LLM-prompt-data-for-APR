The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence. This leads to test failures when the table name casing does not match the casing in the response from the `hive` command.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to modify the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` to be case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name and `stdout` to perform a case-insensitive check for table existence.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
