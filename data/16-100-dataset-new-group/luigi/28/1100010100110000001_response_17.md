The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not properly handling the output of the `run_command` function. From the error messages, we can see that the `returned` value is not as expected. The bug seems to be in the conditions for returning true or false.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function correctly handles the output of the `run_command` function and returns the appropriate boolean value based on whether the table exists or not.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version properly checks whether the table exists in the database and returns the correct boolean value based on the result. This version should pass the failing test.
