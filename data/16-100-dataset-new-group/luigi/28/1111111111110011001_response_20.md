The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be caused by the `stdout` variable not being parsed correctly when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function appears to incorrectly parse the `stdout` variable based on the input, leading to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for parsing the `stdout` variable in both cases where `partition` is None and not None.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() == table
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In the corrected version, the `stdout` variable is stripped of any leading/trailing spaces and checks are made for table existence based on the parsed `stdout` variable.

The corrected version of the function should pass all of the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
