The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The GitHub issue #896 indicates that the function should be case insensitive because Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lowercase, causing the test to fail for capitalized table names.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout of the Hive command to lowercase and then check for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function should now pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. The function is now case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub discussion.
