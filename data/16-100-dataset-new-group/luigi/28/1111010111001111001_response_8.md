Based on the failing test cases and the provided runtime and expected input/output values, it appears that the buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In particular, it seems that the function is not properly checking for the existence of the table or partition based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly checks for the presence of the table or partition in the `stdout` variable. In some cases, the function simply checks for the truthiness of `stdout`, which may not accurately reflect whether the table or partition actually exists.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to explicitly check for the presence of the table or partition in the `stdout` variable, and return `True` if it exists, and `False` otherwise.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
