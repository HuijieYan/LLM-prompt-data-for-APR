The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that it is not handling the case where `run_hive_cmd` returns an output that contains other tables with similar names. This is evident from the runtime input/output values of the function, where in Case 1, for example, the 'mytable' output appears as a substring of the 'OK' stdout. 

To fix this bug, a strategy could be to modify the condition for checking if the table exists. Instead of checking if the table name is present in the entire stdout, it should check if the table name is a separate word in the stdout. This ensures that it is not a substring of another table's name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return stdout and f'\t{table}\n' in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By returning `bool(stdout)` directly, we ensure that the function returns `True` when stdout contains any output and `False` otherwise. This accounts for the situation where the stdout may contain other tables with similar names, which could cause the previous implementation to return an incorrect result.
