The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not handling case sensitivity correctly. This is causing the test cases to fail when checking for table existence.

The GitHub issue (#896) clearly states that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive. The issue describes that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lower case, causing the tests to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before checking for existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
