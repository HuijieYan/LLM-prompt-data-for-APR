The buggy function appears to be a method of a class that handles table existence check in a Hive database. The function takes the table name, database name, and optional partition specifications as input and returns True if the table exists, and False otherwise.

It seems that the bug occurs due to the incorrect processing of the stdout variable, which should contain the output of the Hive commands related to table existence and partitions.

In cases 1, 2, 4, and 5, where the partition is not specified, the function seems to check table existence by matching the table name with the output of the 'show tables' Hive command. In these cases, the function checks if the table name is present in the output, which is incorrect. Instead, it should check if the table name is exactly equal to the output.

In cases 3 and 6, where the partition is specified, the function seems to check partition existence by matching the output of the 'show partitions' Hive command. However, the function does not correctly handle the output and does not consider the partition specifications. As a result, the function does not accurately determine whether the partition exists or not.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to accurately process the stdout variable based on the type of Hive command executed and properly determine the existence of the table or partition.

The corrected version of the function can be as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table, table))
        return stdout == table
    else:
        partitions = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return partitions.strip() != ''
```

In the corrected version:
- When no partition is specified, the 'show tables' command is used to check for the existence of the table in the specified database. The output is compared with the table name to determine its existence.
- When a partition is specified, the 'show partitions' command is used to check for the existence of the partition. The output is stripped of whitespace and checked for non-empty content to determine the existence of the partition.
