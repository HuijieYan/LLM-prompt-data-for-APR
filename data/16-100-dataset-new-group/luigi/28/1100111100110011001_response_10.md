The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the conditions for checking the existence of a table. In particular, the condition to check if the table exists when there is no partition is causing the function to always return `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks the 'stdout' for the presence of the table name. Additionally, we need to modify the conditions for the presence of a partition to include the 'stdout' as well.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and partition in stdout
```

With the corrected `table_exists` function, it should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values for all cases.
