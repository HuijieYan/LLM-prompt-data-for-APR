The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because the function does not handle case-insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The failing test is trying to assert the existence of a table using different case variations, but the function only checks for an exact match, leading to false assertions.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the check.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for table existence. This change ensures that the function is case-insensitive and will pass the failing tests.

The bug fix will also address the GitHub issue #896, as it makes the `table_exists` function case-insensitive as requested.

Additionally, the fix will align with the GitHub issue "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive," as it resolves the case-sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function.
