The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is using the `self.partition_spec` method incorrectly. Without the context of the full code, it's unclear why the method `self.partition_spec` is being called with the `partition` argument. This may be a mistake, and it's possible that the method should not have the `partition` argument.

It's also likely that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not returning the expected output, causing the function to return incorrect values and fail the test.

To fix the bug, you should first check if the `self.partition_spec` method is being used correctly and if it should take the `partition` argument. If it should not take the `partition` argument, you can remove it from the method and the `table_exists` function call. Secondly, ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is returning the expected output. If not, investigate and fix the issues within the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions of the class

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ""
            for key, value in partition.items():
                partition_str += f"{key}={value}/"

            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str[:-1]});")
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we remove the call to `self.partition_spec` and construct the `partition` string directly in the `table_exists` function. Additionally, we simplify the check for the presence of partitions by using `bool(stdout)` to directly return True if `stdout` is not empty, and False if it is.
