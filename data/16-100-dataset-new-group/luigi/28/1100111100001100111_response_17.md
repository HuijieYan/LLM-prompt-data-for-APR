The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not return the correct result when checking for the existence of a table due to case sensitivity issues. The GitHub issue confirms that the function should be case insensitive since Hive is case insensitive and will return table names as lower case.

The bug is in the conditional check within the `table_exists` function where it compares the table name with the output from the Hive command without converting the table name to lowercase. This causes the comparison to fail when the table names are in different cases.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be case insensitive, by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the comparisons are done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparisons, resolving the case sensitivity issue.
