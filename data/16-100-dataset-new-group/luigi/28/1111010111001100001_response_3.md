The bug in the `table_exists` method is that the conditional checks for the presence of table/partition in the output without accounting for case sensitivity.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to perform case-insensitive checks when searching for the table/partition in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table and the output to lowercase before performing the comparison, making it case-insensitive. This change will ensure that the function passes the failing test cases.
