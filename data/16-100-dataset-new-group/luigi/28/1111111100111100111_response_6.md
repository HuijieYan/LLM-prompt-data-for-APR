The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not accounting for case sensitivity when checking for the table's existence in the Hive database. This causes issues when the table name's case doesn't match with the case of the table name returned by the Hive database.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this version, we convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case insensitive. This change resolves the issue of failing tests due to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database.

With these modifications, the failing tests should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved.
