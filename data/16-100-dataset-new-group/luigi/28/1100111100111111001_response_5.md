The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the `stdout` variable is being checked for validity. It appears that the function is incorrectly evaluating the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable. 

Based on the failing tests, it is expected that the function should return `True` only if the table name is present in the `stdout` variable, and `False` otherwise. However, the buggy function seems to be evaluating the presence of the table name in `stdout` in an incorrect manner.

To fix this bug, the buggy function `table_exists` needs to be modified to properly check for the presence of the table name in `stdout` and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout  # Correctly checks for the presence of the table in stdout and returns True or False
    else:
        partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_query})")

        return bool(stdout)  # Returns True if stdout is not empty, indicating that the table exists in the specified partition
```

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
