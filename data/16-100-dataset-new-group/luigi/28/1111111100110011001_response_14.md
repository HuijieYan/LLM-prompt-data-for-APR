Based on the given information, the buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is not returning the correct value in some cases. The expected behavior is that the function should check if a table exists in a given database. When a partition is specified, it should return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise. When no partition is specified, it should return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise.

The bug occurs when the function receives 'OK' as output but doesn't return the correct Boolean value in the test cases.

The issue seems to be related to how the `run_hive_cmd` function is being used to retrieve the output. It also seems that the condition check is not handling the output string properly to check if the table exists.

To fix the bug, we can update the condition check to properly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` and confirm if the table exists based on the received output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other functions ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            # Check if the table exists in the output
            return bool(stdout.strip())  # Return True if output is not empty, False otherwise
        else:
            partition_clause = ' and '.join(["{}='{}'".format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_clause))
            # Check if the partition exists in the output
            return bool(stdout.strip())  # Return True if output is not empty, False otherwise
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the output from `run_hive_cmd` is properly handled by stripping any leading/trailing whitespace and then checking if the resulting string is empty. This approach correctly handles the different output scenarios and returns the expected Boolean result for each case.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected values.
