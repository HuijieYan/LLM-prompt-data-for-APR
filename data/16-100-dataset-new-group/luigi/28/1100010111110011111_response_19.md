To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity issue and ensure that the function returns the correct output based on the input parameters and the contents of the `stdout` variable.

The bug in the original function is that it does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to modify the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` to be case insensitive.
2. We need to ensure that the correct value is returned based on the comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them in a case-insensitive manner. Additionally, we return the result of the comparison directly for the partition case instead of using an `if-else` block to improve readability.

With this correction, the function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding case insensitivity.
