The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the test cases to fail, primarily due to case sensitivity issues. The function is currently not handling case insensitivity while checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This leads to discrepancies between the expected and actual table names, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to consider case insensitivity when comparing table names. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the function now handles case insensitivity properly and will pass the failing test cases. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive (#896).
