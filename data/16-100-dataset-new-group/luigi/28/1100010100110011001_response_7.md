The buggy function has a couple of issues:
1. The first issue is with the `table_exists` function where it returns `stdout and table in stdout`. The problem with this line is that it doesn't handle the case where `stdout` is not empty but does not contain the actual table name.
2. The second issue is with the construction of the `stdout` variable inside the `else` block. The backslashes in the string may be causing the command to be improperly formatted.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the cases when `stdout` is not empty but does not contain the actual table name, and to construct the `stdout` variable without any formatting issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})")
        return True if stdout else False
```

The corrected version of the function should handle both cases and pass the failing test cases.
