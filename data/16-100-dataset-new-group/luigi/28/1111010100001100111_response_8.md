The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in not accounting for case sensitivity when comparing table names in the Hive database. This causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to failing tests and issues reported on GitHub.

The issue on GitHub suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the stdout against the lowercase table name to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})'
        )

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout to account for case insensitivity. This will resolve the reported issues on GitHub and ensure that the `table_exists` function returns the correct results.
