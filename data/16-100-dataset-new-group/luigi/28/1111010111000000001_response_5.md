The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the partition parameter correctly. When `partition` is not None, it is not constructing the command string to check for partition existence properly, which causes the function to return incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that when the `partition` parameter is not None, the function is not constructing the command string correctly to check for partition existence. This results in incorrect output and causes the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command string construction to properly handle the partition parameter and then check for the existence of the partition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        cmd = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

        return bool(stdout)
```

By properly constructing the command string to check for partition existence and using `bool(stdout)` to check if the `stdout` is empty or not, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
