To fix the bug, it seems that the `table_exists` function is case sensitive, causing the test failures when the table names do not match case. The fix involves making the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version makes the comparison case insensitive and should resolve the test failures reported in the GitHub issues.
