The buggy function `table_exists` fails in the test cases when the table name is in a different case than the one returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue on GitHub also confirms that this is a case sensitivity issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name directly to the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which may result in case sensitivity issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to make it case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

In this corrected version, `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` is used to make the comparison case insensitive, which addresses the issue reported in GitHub and should pass the failing tests.
