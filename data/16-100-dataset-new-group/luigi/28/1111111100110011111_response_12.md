The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is causing the test to fail due to case sensitivity issues. The function is supposed to return `True` if a table exists in the specified database, and `False` otherwise. However, it does not handle case insensitivity correctly, causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

The issue is related to a GitHub issue (#896) where it was reported that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive, as Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lowercase. The proposed fix is to compare the table name in lowercase with the output from Hive to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the output from Hive, and return `True` if a match is found, and `False` otherwise.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function now correctly handles case insensitivity, and the test cases should pass without any assertion errors. This solution aligns with the proposed fix in GitHub issue #896, ensuring that table existence checks are case insensitive.
