The bug causing the failing tests is in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The bug causes the function to return the incorrect value based on the stdout variable. The issue seems to be related to the condition checking for the presence of the table in the stdout variable.

The `table_exists` function is supposed to check if a table exists in the given database and partition. The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the stdout variable when checking if the table exists.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to properly check the presence of the table in the stdout variable for both cases. In the first case, the table name should be surrounded by spaces in the stdout to avoid partial matches. In the second case, the table name is case-insensitive so it should be converted to lowercase and then checked against the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and f' {table} ' in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
        return any(partition.lower() in p.lower() for p in stdout.split())
```
