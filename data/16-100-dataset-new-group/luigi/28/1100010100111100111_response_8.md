The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function is only checking for an exact match of the table name in the `stdout`, which causes issues when the case of the table name does not match the case in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now perform a case-insensitive check for the table name in the `stdout`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing tests.
