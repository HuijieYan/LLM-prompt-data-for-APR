The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the test cases to fail due to case sensitivity. The issue on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence in hive.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case sensitivity and directly compares the table name with the output of the Hive command, leading to test failures when the case does not match.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive, the corrected version of the function will pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
