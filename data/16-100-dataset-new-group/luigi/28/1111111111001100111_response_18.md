The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing table names. The function is not handling case sensitivity properly, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` needs to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase using the `lower()` method, the function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison and should pass the failing test cases. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive, as requested.
