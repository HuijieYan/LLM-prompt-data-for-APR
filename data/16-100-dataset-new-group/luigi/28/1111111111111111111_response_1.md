The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The expectation is that the function should be case-insensitive. This issue has been raised on GitHub as issue #896 and a proposed fix has been suggested.

The proposed strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function should convert both the table name and the values in the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % 
                              (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the values in the stdout, making it case-insensitive. This will resolve the failing tests and address the issue raised on GitHub.
