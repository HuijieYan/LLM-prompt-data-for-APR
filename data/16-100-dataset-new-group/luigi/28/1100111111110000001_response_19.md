There are multiple bugs in the given code. Let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code, and the corresponding error message:

1. The `table_exists` function takes three arguments: `table`, `database`, and `partition`. It checks whether a table exists in the specified database. If `partition` is provided, it also checks for the existence of a specific partition within the table.

2. In the first test case, `run_command.return_value` is set to "OK", and the function call `self.client.table_exists("mytable")` returns `False` instead of `True`, which fails the first assertion `self.assertFalse(returned)`. This is unexpected behavior.

3. In the second test case, `run_command.return_value` is set to "OK\nmytable", and the function call `self.client.table_exists("mytable")` returns `False` instead of `True`, which fails the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)`. This is also unexpected behavior.

4. Looking at the error messages, it seems that the returned table existence value is incorrect in both cases.

The cause of bugs in the `table_exists` function is that the conditions for checking the existence of tables are not handled correctly. The `run_hive_cmd` function response is not being correctly processed or evaluated. The tests assume that certain values should return `True`, but they are actually returning `False`.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` response is correctly handled and evaluated. Additionally, the logic for determining the existence of a table should be revised based on the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Implementation of partition_spec

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}"'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partitions))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly determine the existence of tables and partitions. This should address the failing test cases.
