The bug in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it does not handle case-insensitive table names properly. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database, but it fails to account for the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive database.

The function is supposed to return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not. However, due to the case sensitivity issue, it may return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command, ensuring case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now handle case sensitivity properly and return the expected results for the given input parameters. This correction will also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

It's important to note that the case sensitivity issue is specifically mentioned in issue #896 on GitHub, and the proposed fix aligns with the suggested solution in that issue. The fix ensures that the function is now case insensitive when checking for table existence.

This fix will satisfy all the expected input/output values provided and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
