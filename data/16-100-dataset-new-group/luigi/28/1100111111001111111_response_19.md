To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` method to make it case insensitive when checking for table existence.

We will modify the `table_exists` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is not case sensitive and will fix the failing tests. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` method will now compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout, making the comparison case insensitive.

This change satisfies the expected input/output values, resolves the issue posted on GitHub, and should make the failing tests pass.
