The bug is in the `table_exists` function which does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the HiveClient. The expected value of the return variable `stdout` is not handled appropriately leading to failed tests. The GitHub issue indicates that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive, the function can now handle different cases of table names and pass the failing test cases. This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
