To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive when checking if a table exists in Hive. As described in the GitHub issues, the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them.

This solution addresses the case-insensitivity issue described in the GitHub issue and should make the `table_exists` function return the expected results for different cases and inputs.
