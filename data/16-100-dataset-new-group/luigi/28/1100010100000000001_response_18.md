The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The `stdout` variable is assigned a value from a function call `run_hive_cmd`, which is not defined in the provided code.
2. The use of `and` to check for the presence of `table` in `stdout` is not appropriate.

The cause of the bug in the function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not defined, and it is not clear what kind of value it returns. Additionally, the use of the `and` operator in the return statement might lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, define the `run_hive_cmd` function so that it returns the output of the Hive command as a string. Also, use an `if` condition to check the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected function: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` function is assumed to be defined and returns the output of the Hive command as a string. The `if` condition is used to check the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable, and the `bool` function is used to explicitly convert the `stdout` variable to a boolean value.
