## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The bug was caused by the comparison of table names not being case insensitive, leading to incorrect results in the test. By using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` in the comparison, the corrected version ensures case insensitivity.

The corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub, which requested making the `table_exists` function case insensitive. The corrected version should pass the failing test as well.
