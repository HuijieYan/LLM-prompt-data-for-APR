The issue with the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it does not handle case sensitivity of the table names. The failing test cases indicate that the function does not return the correct values when the table names are provided in a different case than what is returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The cause of the bug is related to how the function compares the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should take case sensitivity into account when comparing the table name with the output.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to modify the comparison between the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to be case insensitive.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function that should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` is made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison. This change ensures that the function will return the correct values regardless of the case of the table names.

This corrected version of the function should pass all the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
