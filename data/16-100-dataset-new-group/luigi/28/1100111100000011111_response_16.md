The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug that causes it to be case-sensitive when checking for table existence. This bug prevents the function from correctly identifying the existence of tables with different casing.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering the case sensitivity. This causes the function to return incorrect results when the table name's casing does not match the casing in the Hive output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the function is case-insensitive when checking for table existence.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

The corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread by making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive when checking for table existence.
