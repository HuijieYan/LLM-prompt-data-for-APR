The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This results in failing tests when tables with different cases are checked for existence.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner when checking for existence. Additionally, we should update the related test cases to ensure they pass with the modified function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, the `table` and `stdout` values are converted to lowercase before comparing them to ensure case insensitivity. This change will address the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

By making this modification, the `table_exists` function will correctly handle case sensitivity issues when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.
