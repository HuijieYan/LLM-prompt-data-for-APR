The buggy function `table_exists` fails to return the expected results, especially when it comes to case sensitivity. This has been identified in the failing test where the test case is insensitive and uses tables with capitalized names. 

The issue is also reflected in the GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" raised by a user named Lin. The detailed description mentions that although Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lower case, the original implementation fails to account for this, causing the test to fail. It proposes fixing this issue by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case sensitivity issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to account for case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. Specifically, the function needs to use `table.lower()` in comparison to `stdout.lower()` to correctly handle case sensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the failing test and GitHub issue, and it should resolve the problem.
