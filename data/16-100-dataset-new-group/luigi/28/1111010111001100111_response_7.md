Based on the analysis, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's currently case-sensitive and should be case-insensitive. The inputs to the function include the table name and the database. The function checks if the table exists by querying the database and comparing the output to the table name. However, it doesn't handle case sensitivity, leading to failures in the test cases.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert both the table name and the output from the database to lowercase, and then perform the comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, the function will now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons and pass the failing test cases. This resolves the issue raised in GitHub and ensures the `table_exists` function works as expected.
