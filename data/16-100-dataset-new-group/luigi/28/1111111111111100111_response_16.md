The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive command output. This causes the failing test cases when the table names are in different cases than what is returned by Hive.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lower case, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the bug and making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

This correction should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue reported in GitHub about making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
