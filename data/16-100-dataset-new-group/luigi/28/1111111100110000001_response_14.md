The error seems to be in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. When the `run_hive_cmd` method is called with the command to check if a table exists, it returns a string containing the table name if it exists, or simply "OK" if the table does not exist. The `table_exists` method then checks if the table name is in the returned string to determine if the table exists.

The bug occurs when the table name is included in the string returned by `run_hive_cmd`. The current implementation checks if the table name is in the string and returns `True` if found. However, the failing test cases are trying to check if the table does not exist and are expecting `False` to be returned in those cases.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `table_exists` method to explicitly check if the table exists or not and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return "OK" not in stdout    # Return True if "OK" is not in the output
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return "OK" in stdout   # Return True if "OK" is in the output
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` method should return `False` if the table does not exist, and `True` if it does exist. This should make the failing test cases pass.
