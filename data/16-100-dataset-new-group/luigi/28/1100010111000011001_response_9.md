The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not correctly checking the presence of the table in the database. It returns `True` only if the output is not empty, but it should return `True` if the table is present in the database, and `False` otherwise.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to check if the table is present in the stdout and return True or False accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
