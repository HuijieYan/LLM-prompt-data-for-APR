The bug in the function `table_exists` is causing the failing test cases. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of the returned stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine the existence of the table.

The bug occurs when the function tries to look for the table name in the stdout. In some cases, the stdout includes additional information that causes the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic for comparing the stdout. Specifically, we need to adjust the conditions to correctly check for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({' '.join([f'{k}={v}' for k, v in partition.items()])})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison checks for the table name directly in the stdout without any additional conditions. This should address the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
