## Corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}"'.format(database, database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
1. The buggy function checks if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the run_hive_cmd function to run a Hive command and return the output.
2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the formatting of the Hive commands and the conditional statements for checking the stdout.
3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect formatting of Hive commands and the conditional statements not handling the stdout properly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Hive commands are correctly formatted and the conditional statements handle the stdout properly.
5. The corrected version of the function handles the formatting of Hive commands correctly and uses the 'in' operator to check if the table exists in the stdout. It also uses the 'bool' function to convert the stdout to a boolean value in the case of partition checking.
