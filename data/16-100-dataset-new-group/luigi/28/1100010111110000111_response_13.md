The bug in the `table_exists` function of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is causing the failing test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists`. The error occurs because the function is case sensitive and does not account for lowercase table names. The GitHub issue #896 also addresses this problem, suggesting that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. The bug fix involves checking the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By comparing the lowercase table name with the lowercase output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, we ensure that the `table_exists` function is case insensitive and will pass the failing test. This should also resolve the issue described in GitHub issues #896 and the related issue regarding table case sensitivity.
