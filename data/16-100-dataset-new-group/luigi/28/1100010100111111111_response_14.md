The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is failing because it does not handle case sensitivity in table names, as indicated by the GitHub issues.

The bug is occurring because the function compares the table name directly with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to case sensitivity issues.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will handle table names in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing tests.
