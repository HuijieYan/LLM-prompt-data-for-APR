The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the handling of the `stdout` variable. The function is supposed to check if the table exists in the database by running a Hive command, but the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not handling the cases where `stdout` contains multiple lines and `table` is only present in one of those lines.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if the table exists in the `stdout`. We can split the `stdout` by newline characters and check if the `table` exists in any of the lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
