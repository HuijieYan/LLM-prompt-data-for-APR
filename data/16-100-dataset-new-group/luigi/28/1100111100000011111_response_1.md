Based on the analysis, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not case-insensitive. The expected behavior is that the function should be case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

#### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the direct comparison of the table name with the `stdout`, which may result in a case-sensitive mismatch. The `table_exists` function should instead compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `stdout`.

#### Bug-fixing strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` by converting both to lowercase before comparison.

#### Corrected function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the condition `table in stdout` to `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Now the corrected function satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
