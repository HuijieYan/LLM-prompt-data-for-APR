The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes the tests to fail when the table name cases don't match exactly.

To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this change, the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
