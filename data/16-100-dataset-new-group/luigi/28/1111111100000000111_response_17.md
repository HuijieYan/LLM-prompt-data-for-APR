## Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison in the `table_exists` function between the table name and the stdout.
2. The implementation does not handle case sensitivity.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not being case insensitive when comparing the table name with the stdout. This results in failures when checking for table existence if the case of the table name and the stdout don't match.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by comparing the lower case versions of the table name and the stdout. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the strings.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simplified the return statement
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive. We also simplified the return statement by directly returning the boolean value of `stdout`. This change makes the code cleaner and more readable.
