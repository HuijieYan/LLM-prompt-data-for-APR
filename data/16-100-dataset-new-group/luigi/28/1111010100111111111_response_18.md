The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name against the output from Hive. The test expects the function to be case insensitive, but the current implementation does not account for case differences.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for comparison.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected function, the test cases should now pass as the comparison is now case insensitive, which addresses the issue raised in GitHub.
