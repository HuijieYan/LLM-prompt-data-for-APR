The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.

The bug can be fixed by converting both the table and the stdout to lower case before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change, the function will now handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive, resolving the issue and causing the failing tests to pass.
