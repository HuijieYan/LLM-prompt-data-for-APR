The buggy function is failing to make the comparison case-insensitive, which is causing the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive when checking if the table exists in the `stdout`. We can do this by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them using the `lower()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function should now be case-insensitive and pass the failing tests. The issue posted on GitHub has also been addressed by making the function case-insensitive as suggested.
