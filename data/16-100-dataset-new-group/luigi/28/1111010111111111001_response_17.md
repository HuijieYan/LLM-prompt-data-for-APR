The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition for checking if the table exists is incorrect. The function is incorrectly checking the presence of the table name in the output of `show tables` rather than checking for an exact match, resulting in incorrect behavior. This leads to the failing of the test cases where the expected output is not being returned.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to parse the output of the `show tables` command, split the lines, and check for an exact match of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Just return the boolean result of stdout
```

In this corrected function, for the case when `partition` is None, we split the output from `show tables` into individual lines using `split('\n')` and then check if the table name is present in the list of tables. For the other case, we directly return the evaluated boolean result of `stdout`.

This corrected function should satisfy all the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
