The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database, and there is an issue related to case sensitivity when comparing table names.

The primary issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, which leads to failures in the test cases. The GitHub issues #896 and another related discussion indicate that the function should be case-insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. A strategy to fix the bug is to convert both the table name and the output from the command to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the table name and the output from the command are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the bug and passing the failing test cases. The fix aligns with the suggestions provided in the GitHub issues.
