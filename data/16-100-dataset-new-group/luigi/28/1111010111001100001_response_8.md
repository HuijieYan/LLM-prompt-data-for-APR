The buggy function `table_exists` has a couple of issues that are causing the failing test cases.

The first issue is with the condition checking the existence of a table when no partition is specified. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` to check if a table exists in the given database. However, the condition to check if the table exists is not accurate, causing incorrect returns for the test cases.

The second issue is with the condition when a partition is specified. The function constructs a hive command to check for the existence of a specific partition for the table. However, the condition to check for the existence of the partition is not properly implemented, leading to incorrect returns for the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition statements to correctly determine the existence of the table or partition based on the outputs of the `run_hive_cmd`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table};"')
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we split the output of `run_hive_cmd` to get a list of tables when no partition is specified, and then check if the given table exists in the list.

For partitions, we use `bool(stdout)` to directly determine if the partition exists based on the output of the command.

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
