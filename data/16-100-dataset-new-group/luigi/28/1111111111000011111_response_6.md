Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Explanation:
The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not handling case insensitivity properly. The function is comparing the table name directly against the stdout, leading to case sensitivity issues.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function performs a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them.

This approach addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post and fulfills the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case insensitivity and pass the failing test cases.
