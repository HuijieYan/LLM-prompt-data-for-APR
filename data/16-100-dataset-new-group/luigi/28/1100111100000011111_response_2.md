# The buggy function has an issue with case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

The bug occurs when the function checks for the existence of a table in Hive using a case-sensitive comparison. Hive is case insensitive, so the table name returned from Hive might be in a different case than the one being checked. This causes the function to fail even if the table actually exists. The GitHub issue highlights this problem and suggests using a case-insensitive comparison to fix it.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the code to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table regardless of the case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

In the corrected version, the table name and the output from Hive are both converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This allows for a case-insensitive comparison, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub post.
