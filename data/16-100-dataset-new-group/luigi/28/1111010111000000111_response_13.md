The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not adopting case insensitivity while checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database, which is causing the test cases to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `table_exists` does not ignore the case when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This leads to a situation where a table defined with a different case than what is passed in the check will not be found, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, it is suggested to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name using a case-insensitive approach. This can be done by converting both the table name and the hive response to lowercase and then doing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This should resolve the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue related to the case insensitivity bug.
