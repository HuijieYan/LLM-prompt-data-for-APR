The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` has a bug because it checks for the presence of a table in Hive using a case-sensitive comparison. This is contrary to the Hive behavior, which is case-insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. We can do this by converting both the table name and the command output to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive comparison, and it should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issues posted on GitHub.
