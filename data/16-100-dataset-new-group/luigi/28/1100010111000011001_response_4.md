The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be in the conditional checks for the `stdout` variable. The function should return True if the table exists or False otherwise, but the current implementation seems to be incorrect.

The buggy function has an if-else condition for checking the existence of the table and handling partitions. However, both conditions are returning the wrong output. For the first condition, the function is returning True if `stdout` is not empty and the table is in `stdout`, which is correct. But for the second condition, it should return True if `stdout` is not empty, but it's returning the opposite.

To fix the bug, we should return False if `stdout` is empty and return True if the table is in `stdout` for both conditions. Also, we need to handle the partition case correctly.

Using the information provided, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout
```

This corrected function should satisfy all the expected input/output values and pass the failing test cases.
