The bug seems to be related to the `table_exists` function, where it's not properly handling the case sensitivity of table names. This is evident from the runtime input/output variable values, as well as the error messages in the failing test cases. In particular, the failing test cases all involve checking for the existence of a table with different cases of the table name.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name comparison is case-insensitive. We can accomplish this by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
