The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to incorrect handling of the `stdout` value returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is not correctly checking if the table exists in the database and is not handling partitioning correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the case where `stdout` contains the table name and where it does not. Additionally, the function needs to properly handle partitioned tables.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Implementation of partition_spec

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str});")
            return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now handle the cases for both regular and partitioned tables, and should pass the failing tests.
