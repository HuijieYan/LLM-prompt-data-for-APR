The bug is in the `table_exists` function, where the check for table existence is case-sensitive, causing the test cases to fail. The bug is identified in the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

To fix the bug, the comparison between table names should be made case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
