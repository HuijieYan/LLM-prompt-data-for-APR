The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` is not correctly handling the case when the `partition` parameter is not `None`. When `partition` is not `None`, the function should construct the command using the `partition_spec` method, but it is not doing so correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct command when `partition` is not `None`, using the `partition_spec` method to construct the partition specification.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(
                database, table, partition_cmd))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By using the `partition_spec` method to construct the partition specification in the command passed to `run_hive_cmd`, the bug should be fixed and the function should pass the failing test.
