Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

The suggested fix is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The fix involves converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` function, so the comparison becomes case insensitive. This change aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue.

This updated version of the `table_exists` function should resolve the case sensitivity issue when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.
