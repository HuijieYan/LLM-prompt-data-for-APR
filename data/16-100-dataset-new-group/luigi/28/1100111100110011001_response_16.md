The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns the condition `table in stdout` instead of checking if the table is listed in the returned string. This causes the function to return the wrong value, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the table is listed in the returned string, rather than simply checking for the presence of the table name. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions and classes here...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')  # Modified condition to check if the table is listed in the output
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
