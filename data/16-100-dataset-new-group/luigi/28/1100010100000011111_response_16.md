The buggy function has a bug where it doesn't account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug is that it does not convert both the table name and the stdout to a consistent case for comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before making the comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and the function will return the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

Now, the function will convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before checking for the table's existence, making it case insensitive. This corrected version will satisfy all the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
