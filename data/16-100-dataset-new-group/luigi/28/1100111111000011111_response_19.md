The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity properly. Since Hive is case insensitive, it returns table names in lowercase, which can cause the tests to fail when comparing the table name in the function. The missing case insensitivity check leads to incorrect test results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to handle case insensitivity by converting the table name to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, resolving the case sensitivity issue.

This corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub. Now, the function will pass the failing test cases.
