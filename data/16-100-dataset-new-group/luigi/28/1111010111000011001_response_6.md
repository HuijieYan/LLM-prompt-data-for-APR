The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not properly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is expecting a specific format for the output, but the output is not being properly processed to check for the existence of the table.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and check for the existence of the table in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simplified the if-else logic to return True for non-empty stdout and False for empty stdout
```

This corrected version handles the stdout properly to check for the existence of the table and should pass the failing test cases.
