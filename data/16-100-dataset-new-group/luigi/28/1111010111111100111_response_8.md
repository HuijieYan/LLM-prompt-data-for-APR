The bug in the function `table_exists` is causing the failing test cases due to the case sensitivity issue with the table names. The bug is a part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The failing test case ensures that the `table_exists` function correctly checks for the existence of a table, including case insensitivity. The failing test cases show that when checking for table existence with different cases, the function returns incorrect results.

The bug in the function is that it does not account for the case sensitivity of table names when comparing them to the output of the `show tables` or `show partitions` commands. This causes the function to incorrectly return `False` for table existence in some cases where it should return `True`.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output of the hive commands needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now correctly handles case sensitivity by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison. This addresses the issue of incorrectly returning `False` for table existence in some cases due to case sensitivity.

This fix resolves the issue reported in GitHub related to table existence being case insensitive. After applying this fix, the failing test cases for `table_exists` should pass.
