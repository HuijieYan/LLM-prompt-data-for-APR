Based on the runtime input/output values, the expected input/output values, and the information from the GitHub issues, it appears that the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when comparing table names with the output of Hive commands. This causes test failures when table names are not in lowercase.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case sensitivity when comparing table names with the Hive stdout, and the test cases should pass as expected.
