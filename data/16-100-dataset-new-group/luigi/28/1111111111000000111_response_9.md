The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is failing the test due to a case sensitivity issue. The bug causes the function to return `False` if the table name is not in lower case, even though Hive is case insensitive. This causes the test to fail when it expects `True` for uppercase or mixed-case table names. The GitHub issue #896 refers to this problem and suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues. 

To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout`. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive and resolving the issue.
