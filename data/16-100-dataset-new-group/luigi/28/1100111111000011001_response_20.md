The cause of the bug in the provided function is that the `table_exists` function is not returning the expected values based on the input parameters and the behavior of the related functions.

Based on the failing test, the buggy function is expected to return `True` when the table exists and `False` when the table does not exist. However, the buggy function does not handle the conditional checks properly when using the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine the existence of the table.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and the comparison of the `stdout` variable need to be adjusted to correctly handle the different cases.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout.strip() == 'OK'  # Check if the stdout is 'OK'
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout.strip())  # Check if stdout is not empty
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function now properly checks the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and returns `True` or `False` based on the presence of the table in the Hive database. This should address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
