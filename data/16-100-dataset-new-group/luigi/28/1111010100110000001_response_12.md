The bug is occurring in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The issue is that when `partition` is `None`, the function checks whether the table exists in the database by executing a Hive command checking for the table name in the output, but it is not handling the returned value correctly. Similarly, when `partition` is not None, the function is not properly capturing the output and returning the correct boolean value.

The root cause of the bug is that when `partition` is not `None`, the condition for returning `True` is not handled correctly in the function. It expects the output from `run_hive_cmd` to always be `True` and does not properly handle the different return cases from `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix the bug, the function should properly capture the output from the `run_hive_cmd` and perform appropriate checks on that output to determine if the table exists.

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` and return the appropriate boolean value based on whether the table exists or not. This should resolve the failing test cases.
