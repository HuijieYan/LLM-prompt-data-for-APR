Based on the error messages and the GitHub issues, it seems that the problem with the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling case insensitivity correctly, leading to failing tests and a GitHub issue. The expected behavior is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be updated so that it compares the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the function uses `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to compare the table name with the output from the Hive command in a case-insensitive way.

This fix should address the failing tests and the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
