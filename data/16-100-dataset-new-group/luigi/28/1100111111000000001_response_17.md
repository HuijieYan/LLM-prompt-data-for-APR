There is a bug in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class which results in failing the test case. The bug is in the `if partition is None` case. 

The bug occurs because the logic in the `table_exists` function does not handle the case when the `run_hive_cmd` function returns an empty string. Instead, it should be checking for a non-empty string to determine if the table exists.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check for a non-empty stdout, and also apply the `.strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout.strip() != ""
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` method should now pass the failing test.
