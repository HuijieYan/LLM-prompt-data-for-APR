The bug in the provided function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This issue has been addressed in a GitHub issue, where it is suggested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case sensitivity issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the function to compare the lowercased versions of `table` and `stdout`, we ensure that the table check is case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue. This corrected version of the function will now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issues posted in GitHub.
