The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. It seems that the function is not handling the case-insensitivity correctly, leading to failing test cases. The GitHub issue #896 also confirms this, as it discusses the need to make `table_exists` case-insensitive to avoid issues with different capitalizations.

The buggy function fails the test cases because it does not account for case sensitivity when checking the existence of a table. This is evident from the failing test cases where a table with different capitalization is expected to exist, but the function returns False instead of True.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison. This approach will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the letters.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using `lower()` before comparison, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity and should pass the failing test cases. This fix aligns with the suggested solution provided in the GitHub issue to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
