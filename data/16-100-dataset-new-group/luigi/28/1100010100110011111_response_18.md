## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

## Justification
The bug is caused because the function `table_exists` is case-sensitive and does not account for variations in case when checking for table existence. This discrepancy causes the test to fail when comparing the expected and actual output.

## Fix
To fix this bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive when comparing the table name with the stdout. This can be done by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for table existence.

The modified function ensures that the `table` is converted to lowercase using table.lower() and then checks for its existence in the lowercase `stdout` using stdout.lower().

Additionally, the `partition_spec` method has not been defined in the provided code snippet. If it is a method that exists in the actual code, it should be used within the fixed function as well.

This fix will address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and also ensure that the function passes the failing test case.

The corrected version of the function is provided above.
