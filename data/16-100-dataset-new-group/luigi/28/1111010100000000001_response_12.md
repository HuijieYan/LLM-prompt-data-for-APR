The potential error in the buggy function is that the condition `stdout and table in stdout` may not be evaluating to True even if the table exists. Similarly, the condition `if stdout:` may not be sufficient to determine if the table exists when a partition is specified.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function properly, leading to inaccurate results when checking if a table exists with or without a partition.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to check the stdout string returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function for specific keywords that indicate the existence of the table. Another strategy is to handle the partition check separately to determine if the table exists within the specified partition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout is not None # check if the output is not empty to determine if the table exists with the specified partition
```

In this corrected version, the function properly checks the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and handles the partition check separately to accurately determine if the table exists.
