The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database, leading to failing test cases and the GitHub issue #896.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command to be case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that passes the failing test and resolves GitHub issue #896:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
