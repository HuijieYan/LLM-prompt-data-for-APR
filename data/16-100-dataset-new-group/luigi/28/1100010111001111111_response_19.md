To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison of the table name case-insensitive when checking if the table exists in the Hive database. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected function, the comparison is made case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for the table's existence. This will address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test cases.
