The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it is case-sensitive when comparing the table name from the `run_hive_cmd()` output with the provided table name. This is inconsistent with Hive's case-insensitive behavior.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the `run_hive_cmd()` output should be made case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the table name and the `run_hive_cmd()` output are converted to lowercase using `lower()`. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison, consistent with the behavior of Hive.

This fix should resolve the failing tests and also address the issue reported on GitHub related to case-insensitive table existence checks.
