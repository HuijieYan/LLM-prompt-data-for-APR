The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug that causes the failing test cases to produce incorrect results and assert errors. The bug occurs when the function fails to account for the case insensitivity of table names in Hive.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The failing test cases are checking for the existence of tables with different cases than the ones returned by Hive, resulting in assertion errors.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` needs to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the assertion errors in the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle case insensitivity and pass the failing tests.

This fix addresses the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making `table_exists` case insensitive.
