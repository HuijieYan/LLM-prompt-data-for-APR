The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when comparing table names. As a result, tests are failing because the function is not returning the correct value when checking for the existence of a table.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout should be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case insensitivity when comparing table names, and the failing tests should pass. This fix addresses the issue reported in GitHub and should resolve the problem with the `table_exists` function.
