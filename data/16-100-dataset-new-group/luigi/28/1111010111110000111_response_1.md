The cause of the bug is that the table_exists function is not case insensitive, causing failed test cases when the table names differ only in case. The bug is documented in GitHub issue #896.

To fix the bug, modify the table_exists function to make it case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking if the table name exists in the stdout. This will ensure that the function is not affected by case discrepancies.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The correction involves converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method before checking for the table existence. This approach ensures that the function is case insensitive and will pass the failing test cases.
