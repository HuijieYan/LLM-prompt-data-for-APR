To fix the buggy function, we need to correct the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function to properly handle the return value of `run_hive_cmd`.

In the first case, the buggy function is incorrectly returning a boolean based on the presence of the table name in the `stdout` string, rather than checking whether `stdout` contains the exact table name. This can be fixed by splitting the `stdout` string and checking if the table name is in the resulting list.

In the second case, the function is incorrectly returning False when it should be returning True. This is likely due to the incorrect conditional check on the `stdout` value when the table name is present.

Considering the expected values, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to return True if the table name exactly matches a value in the `stdout` string, and return False otherwise.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_names = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in table_names
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function should now return the expected results for the failing test cases.
