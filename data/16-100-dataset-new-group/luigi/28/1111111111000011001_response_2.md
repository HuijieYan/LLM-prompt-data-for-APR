The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions. The buggy function checks if a table exists in a Hive database. It first checks if a partition is provided, and if so, it uses the `partition_spec` function to construct a command, then calls `run_hive_cmd` with the command. The bug likely lies in the construction of the command or the way the output of `run_hive_cmd` is evaluated.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect construction of the command when a partition is provided. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling partitions correctly, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a partition is provided, the command passed to `run_hive_cmd` is constructed correctly and that the output from `run_hive_cmd` is being handled and evaluated properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_cmd = " and ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        cmd = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_cmd)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
        return bool(stdout.strip())  # Consider non-empty output as True
```

In this corrected version, we construct the command for fetching the partitions properly and then evaluate the output of `run_hive_cmd` to check for the existence of the table. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the stdout.

By making these changes, we ensure that the function handles the partition information correctly and correctly evaluates the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
