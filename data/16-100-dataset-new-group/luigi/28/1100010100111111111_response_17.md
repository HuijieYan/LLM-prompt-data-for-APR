After analyzing the buggy function and the failing tests, we can see that the issue is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The GitHub issue #896 also confirms that the table_exists function should be case insensitive. 

The bug occurs because the buggy function does not convert the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison, leading to the failing tests where case sensitivity causes the assertion errors.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the buggy function to convert the table name and the stdout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. 

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison, this corrected version of the function will address the case sensitivity issue and pass the failing tests.
