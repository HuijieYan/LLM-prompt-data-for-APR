The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable. The buggy function returns the value of `stdout` directly as a boolean expression, which may not accurately reflect the presence of the table in the database.

To fix this bug, we should check if the table exists based on the content of `stdout` rather than just its existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we split the `stdout` by whitespace and check if the `table` is in the resulting list of tables. For the case when `partition` is not None, we simply return whether `stdout` has content or not. This will ensure that the function accurately determines if the table exists in the database.

The corrected function should pass the failing test.
