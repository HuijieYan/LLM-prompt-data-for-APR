## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Compare in lower case
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

After analyzing the related functions, test code, corresponding error message, and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be caused by the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. The function `table_exists` should compare the table name from the command output in a case-insensitive manner. The existing code only compares the exact table name with the output, leading to test failures when the case is different.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name and the command output in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase before comparison.

The corrected version of the buggy function, `table_exists`, has been updated to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. It uses the `lower()` function to convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the function is case-insensitive. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
