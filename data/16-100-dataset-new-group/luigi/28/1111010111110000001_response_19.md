The buggy function `table_exists` seems to have a bug in how it's handling the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It should return `True` when the table exists and `False` when it doesn't. Currently, it's returning `False` when the table exists and `True` when it doesn't.

The main problem resides in the if conditions within the `table_exists` function. Specifically, the first case should return `True` when `stdout` is not empty (i.e., the table exists) and `False` when `stdout` is empty. The second case has a similar problem. The return values should be swapped there as well.

To fix this bug, the return values in the `if` conditions need to be swapped in the `table_exists` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return False
            else:
                return True
```

After making this change, the function should return the proper values, and the failing test should pass.
