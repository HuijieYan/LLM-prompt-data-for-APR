## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with corresponding error message
The buggy function is called `table_exists` and it is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database in Hive. The function is returning incorrect results, which is causing the tests to fail and raise AssertionErrors.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional blocks. The returned values based on the conditions are not consistent with the expected outcomes.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the corresponding error message
The cause of the bug is the inconsistency in how the return values are being handled based on the output of the Hive commands. The function is supposed to return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't, but it's not doing that correctly.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
A strategy for fixing the bug would involve checking the output of the Hive command and returning `True` only if the table name is found in the output. If the table is not found, then it should return `False`.

## The corrected version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
