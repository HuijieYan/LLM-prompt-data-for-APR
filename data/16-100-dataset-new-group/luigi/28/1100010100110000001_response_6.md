The issue in the buggy function is that it does not return the expected output as per the test. The returned value is not consistent with the expected value in some test cases.

The potential error locations are in the conditions where the return value of `stdout` is being evaluated.

Cause of the bug:
1. In the first condition, the buggy function is checking if `stdout` and `table` are present. It should instead check if `stdout` contains the string "OK" to indicate successful execution.
2. In the else condition, if the `stdout` is not null, it should return `True` instead of `False`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the condition to check if "OK" is present in the `stdout` for the first condition.
2. In the else condition, directly return the evaluated `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return "OK" in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By using the modified buggy code, the corrected function will now return the expected output and pass the failing tests.
