The bug in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class is likely due to the way it's checking for the existence of a table and handling the partition parameter. The error message from the failing test indicates an assertion error, specifically that `False` is not `True`. This error occurs when trying to verify that the table exists.

The fix strategy involves correcting the way the `table_exists` method checks for the table's existence and handles the partition parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_exists = table in stdout.split('\n')
        return table_exists
    else:
        partition_query = ' && '.join([f"{key}='{value}'" for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_query))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we split the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function by the newline character and check if the table exists in the resulting list of table names. Additionally, we construct a partition query by converting the `partition` dictionary into a string and use it to query partitions. The last line returns a boolean based on whether the `stdout` is empty or not.

This corrected version should resolve the assertion error and the failing test cases.
