## Strategy for fixing the bug
The issue is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The bug causes the table existence check to fail when the table name has different cases than the one in the Hive metadata. To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to check the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # case insensitive check
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With the modification, the `table_exists` function will compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive, ensuring that the check is case-insensitive. This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub thread and resolves the problem of table existence checks failing due to case sensitivity.
