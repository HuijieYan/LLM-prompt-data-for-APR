The buggy function `table_exists` is failing to pass the provided test cases due to the case sensitivity issue. The issue can be resolved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will help to make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases. It will also resolve the issue outlined in the GitHub posts. The comparison is now case-insensitive, and the results should match the expected values.
