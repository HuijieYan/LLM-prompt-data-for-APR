## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

By using f-strings and making use of the `bool` function, I've simplified the code and corrected the logic of the original `table_exists` function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
