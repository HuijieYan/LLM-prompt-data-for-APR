## Analysis:
The function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a particular database and partition. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions to perform its task. Based on the provided code, the potential error locations are:
1. Incorrect usage of the `partition_spec` function.
2. Missing import statements for the required functions.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the code is due to the incorrect usage of the `partition_spec` function. The function is called as `self.partition_spec(partition)`, but it's not defined within the `HiveCommandClient` class. It should be called as `partition_spec(partition)`.

## Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to call the `partition_spec` function correctly. Also, any missing import statements for the required functions need to be added.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The required import statements for the related functions
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

# The corrected class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # The corrected function 'partition_spec'
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The buggy function with the bug fixed
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec(partition)))  # Corrected call to 'partition_spec'
            
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
