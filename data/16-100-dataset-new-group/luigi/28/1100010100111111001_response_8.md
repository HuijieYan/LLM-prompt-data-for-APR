The buggy function has a conditional statement that checks whether the `partition` input is None. In one case, it runs a Hive command to check for the existence of the table without a partition, and in the other case, it runs a Hive command to check for the existence of the table with a partition.

The cause of the bug is that in the first case, the function is incorrectly checking if `stdout` exists and that the `table` is in `stdout`. In the second case, the function is incorrectly checking if `stdout` exists, but it should be checking if it is not an empty string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements and the checks of the `stdout` variable to ensure that the correct conditions are being evaluated.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table  # Check if table exists in the output
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # Check if the output is not empty
```

In the corrected version:
- We use the `strip()` method to remove leading/trailing whitespace before comparing the `stdout` with the `table` in the first case.
- We use `bool(stdout)` to check if the `stdout` is not empty in the second case.

These modifications ensure that the correct conditions are being evaluated, and the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
