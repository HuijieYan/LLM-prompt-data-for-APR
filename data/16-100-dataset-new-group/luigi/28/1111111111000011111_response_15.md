The buggy function `table_exists` is currently failing to return the correct results for the given cases. The issue has been identified on GitHub, and it is related to case sensitivity in the comparison of table names. When checking for an existing table, it is expected that the function will return `True` if the table exists, regardless of the case of the input table name. 

The bug in the function is related to case sensitivity. The function compares the table name with the output from the command but fails to account for the case of the table name, leading to inconsistent results.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and accurate.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the bug.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test without any issues and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it addresses the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
