The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns the opposite boolean value of what is expected. This is causing the failing test cases to fail with `AssertionError: False is not true`.

The issue stems from the logic inside the `table_exists` function, where it checks for the existence of a table in the `stdout`. If the table is found in `stdout`, it should return `True`, indicating that the table exists. However, the function returns `True` when `stdout` exists and `False` when it does not.

To fix this bug, the logic inside the `table_exists` function needs to be updated to correctly return `True` when the table is found and `False` when it is not.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other functions

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in (stdout or "")
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we're using the `in` keyword to check if the table is present in the `stdout`. We're also using the `bool()` function to return `True` if `stdout` is non-empty, indicating that the table exists.
