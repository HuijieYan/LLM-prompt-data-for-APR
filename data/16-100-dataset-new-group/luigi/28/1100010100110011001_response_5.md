## The buggy function and its relationship with the error message and expected input/output values
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. The function interacts with a Hive command and returns a boolean value based on whether the table exists or not. The error message indicates that the function is not returning the expected values, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

The expected input/output values for the function are:
1. For input parameters `database` and `table`, the function is expected to return a boolean value based on the existence of the table in the database.
2. The expected values and types of the `stdout` variable right before the return statement are provided for each test case, which the function should evaluate to determine the existence of the table.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements and the evaluation of the `stdout` variable. It seems that the conditional statements and the logic for evaluating the `stdout` content may not be working as intended, leading to incorrect return values.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the conditional logic for evaluating the `stdout` variable needs to be reviewed and corrected to accurately determine the existence of the table. Additionally, any discrepancies in the expected values of `stdout` for each test case should be addressed to ensure that the function returns the correct boolean value based on the table existence.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)  # Modified logic to return boolean based on the presence of table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Modified logic to return boolean based on the presence of stdout
```
In the corrected version of the function, the logic for evaluating the `stdout` variable has been modified to return a boolean based on the presence of the table in the `stdout`. This approach directly addresses the issue of incorrect return values and should satisfy all the provided test cases.
