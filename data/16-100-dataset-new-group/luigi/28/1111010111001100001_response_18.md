The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the logic used to check the existence of a table and its partitions. It currently does a partial string match on stdout to determine table existence, and it does not handle the case-insensitive nature of the inputs, which leads to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to handle the case-insensitive nature of the table names and check for exact matches. We should also modify the logic to handle the existence of partitions when the `partition` argument is not None, and handle the case where the stdout is empty.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        return table.lower() in [t.strip().lower() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t.strip()]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return len(stdout.strip()) > 0
```
