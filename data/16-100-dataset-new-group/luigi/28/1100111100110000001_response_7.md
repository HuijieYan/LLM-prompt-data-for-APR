The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be in the logic used to check if the table exists in the specified database. The issue arises from incorrect string comparison and handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The failing tests run `table_exists` on "mytable" and "MyTable", and we can observe that the lowercase and uppercase version of the table name are not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect assertions later in the tests.

Here is a step-by-step guide for fixing the bug:

1. The issue appears to be with the checks of the table name returned from `run_hive_cmd`. It seems that the subprocess output is not being handled correctly or efficiently for the string comparison. Additionally, the lower and upper case of the table names are not handled uniformly. The proposed solution is to convert both strings to lowercase before comparison.

2. Add code to handle the table name regardless of case sensitivity. Convert both the target and the source table names to lowercase before making the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)"""
                                   % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the target and source table names are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before making the comparison. Also, it's necessary to use `split()` on `stdout.lower()` to account for the table name being one of the items in the response list.

With this corrected version, the failing tests for the `table_exists` function (in both `HiveCommandClientTest` and `ApacheClientTest`) should pass successfully.
