To fix the buggy function, it is important to make it case-insensitive when comparing the table name with the stdout. This will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub and also make the function more robust.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values, as well as resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
