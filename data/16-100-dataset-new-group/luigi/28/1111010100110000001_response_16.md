The issue seems to be with the incorrect implementation of the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The method is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database and return `True` or `False` based on the existence of the table. The issue arises from how the function is processing the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the stdout when checking for the existence of a table. As a result, the test cases are failing because the function is returning incorrect values.

To fix the bug, we should update the way the function handles the stdout from `run_hive_cmd` and properly check for the existence of the table in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `split` method to separate the output by lines and then check if the table exists within the output. This ensures that we properly handle the stdout from `run_hive_cmd` and return the correct value based on the existence of the table.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
