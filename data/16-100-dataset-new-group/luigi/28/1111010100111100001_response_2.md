The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the incomplete implementation of the conditions for checking table existence and the incorrect logic in processing the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The bug occurs when the function tries to check if a table exists in the Hive database. It does this by running a Hive command and then processing the output to determine if the table exists.

The bug manifests as incorrect return values when checking for the existence of a table. The error message from the failing test confirms that the function returns incorrect values in various scenarios, as shown in the provided runtime input/output values.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements for checking table existence need to be revised to correctly handle different scenarios. Additionally, the logic for processing the output from the Hive command needs to be improved to accurately determine if a table exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables'.format(database))

            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_spec))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version eliminates the incorrect conditions and improves the logic for processing the output to accurately determine the existence of the specified table in the Hive database.
