The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test case in both the `HiveCommandClientTest` and `HiveCommandClientTest` due to case sensitivity issues.

The buggy function is not handling the case sensitivity of table names appropriately. It is returning stdout and then checking if the table name is in the output without performing any case transformations. This leads to failed assertions in the test cases, specifically when checking for the existence of a table with a differently-cased name.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will convert the table name and the output from Hive to a consistent case (lowercase) and then perform the comparison for checking table existence.

This should resolve the issue and the failing test cases, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue.
