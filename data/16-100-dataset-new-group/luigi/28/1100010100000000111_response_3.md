The potential error location in the buggy function is the comparison of the table names, as the function is not case insensitive and may fail due to case mismatches when running Hive queries.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence. This causes issues when a table name is provided in a different case than what is returned by Hive, leading to failed tests.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the function to convert both the table name and the returned stdout to lowercase before comparison, making it case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive as requested in the GitHub issue.
