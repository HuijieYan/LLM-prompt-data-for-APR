The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi.contrib.hive` is failing the test cases because of an issue with how it handles partitioned tables.

The issue stems from the `else` branch of the `table_exists` function. In the `else` block, the function is expecting that a non-empty stdout will indicate that the table exists, but an empty stdout does not necessarily mean that the table does not exist. This is causing the test to fail when it encounters a partitioned table.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic of the `table_exists` function so that it accurately determines the existence of a table regardless of whether it is partitioned or not.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        stdout = ""
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1};".format(database, table))
            if partition in stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False

        return table in stdout.split()
```

In the corrected version, we handle the partitioned case separately, checking if the specified partition exists in the stdout. For non-partitioned tables, we simply split the stdout by whitespace and check if the table exists in the resulting list. This should address the issues with partitioned tables and ensure that the test cases pass.
