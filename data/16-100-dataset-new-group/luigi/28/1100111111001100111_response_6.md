The cause of the bug is that the table names are being checked against the stdout without taking into account the case sensitivity of the table names in Hive. The buggy function does not perform case-insensitive comparisons, leading to test failures when table names are given in different cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import re
import luigi.contrib.hive

# The buggy function is fixed here
class HiveCommandClient(luigi.contrib.hive.HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = luigi.contrib.hive.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = luigi.contrib.hive.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version uses the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them.

This correction should fix the case sensitivity issue and make the tests pass. It also addresses the GitHub issues by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
