The bug in the given code is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in a database. The current implementation does not account for case sensitivity, which causes issues with table names that are not in the expected case.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case-insensitive table name comparisons. In the provided runtime values, the input table names have different cases from the ones returned by the Hive query. This leads to incorrect results and the function does not perform the intended table existence check.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the input table name and the returned table names to lowercase before performing the comparison. This will make the check case insensitive and align with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the input table name and the returned table names to lowercase for comparison, the function will now work correctly and address the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
