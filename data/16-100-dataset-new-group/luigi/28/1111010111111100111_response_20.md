The buggy function `table_exists` has two issues:
1. During the check for table existence, it does not handle case insensitivity, which leads to failing tests when checking for tables in different cases.
2. There is a mistake in the conditional checks for the presence of tables.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the conditional checks to handle case insensitivity.
2. Use `table.lower()` to match the lowercase table name with the lowercase output from `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition {self.partition_spec(partition)}")

            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function addresses the case insensitivity issue by using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` for the comparison, ensuring that the check for table existence is case insensitive. This modification aligns with the resolution proposed in the GitHub issue #896.

After making these changes, the failing test case should pass, resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
