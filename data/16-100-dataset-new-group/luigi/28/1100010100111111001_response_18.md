The bug in the function `table_exists` is caused by the incorrect comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name. The function is designed to check if a table exists in the database, but the comparison `table in stdout` is problematic because it incorrectly checks whether the table name is a substring of `stdout` instead of checking if it is an exact match. This results in the function returning the wrong values in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to check for an exact match of the table name in the `stdout` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""
```

In the corrected version, we use `stdout.split()` to convert the output into a list of table names and then use `in` to check if the exact table name is in the list. Additionally, in the case of a partition, we simply return `stdout != ""` to check if any partitions exist for the given table.
