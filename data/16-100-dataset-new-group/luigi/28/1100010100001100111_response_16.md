The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to failing tests when the table name is in a different case than the one returned by the Hive database.

The suggested fix, as mentioned in the GitHub issue, is to check `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` instead of a direct comparison for case insensitive matching.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By performing case insensitive matching using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, the corrected version resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
