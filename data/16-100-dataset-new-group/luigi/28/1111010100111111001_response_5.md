The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be related to how the `stdout` variable is being checked for truthiness. In the first case, the function should return `table in stdout` if `stdout` is not empty, but the code incorrectly checks for a truthy `stdout` value. In the second case, the function should return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, but the code incorrectly checks for a truthy value by just checking if `stdout` exists.

To fix the bug, we need to properly check for the presence of the `table` in the `stdout` string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly check if the `table` is present in the `stdout` string and return the expected boolean value.
