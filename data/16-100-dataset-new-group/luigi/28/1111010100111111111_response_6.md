The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing tests due to case sensitivity issues. The function is not handling case insensitivity when comparing the table names with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This causes the tests to fail when trying to determine if a table exists in the database.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and the tests will pass as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform case-insensitive comparisons, which will fix the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this solution addresses the issue reported in GitHub regarding the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and satisfy the failing tests.
