The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely causing it to always return `False` regardless of the actual existence of the table. 

The cause of the bug is that the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` in the first part of the `if` statement is likely returning `False` when it should be `True`, and similarly, the second part of the `if` statement is also returning `False` when it should be `True`. This is evident from the failing test cases where the expected output is not being returned.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly check for the existence of the table and return `True` when the table exists and `False` when it does not.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
