The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test because it is not handling the input parameters correctly. The issue arises from the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` in the `table_exists` function. The bug is causing discrepancies in the return value when the data in the `stdout` does not exactly match with the `table` name.

A potential bug fix strategy would be to modify the comparison mechanism to handle both cases where the `table` is found in the `stdout` and where it is not found. The function also needs to handle the case where the table name in the `stdout` does not match exactly with the `table` name by ignoring any differences in case sensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0};'.format(database))
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
