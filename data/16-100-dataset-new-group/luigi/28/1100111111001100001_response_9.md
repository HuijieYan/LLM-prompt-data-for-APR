The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the case when the `stdout` variable is not empty.

The cause of the bug is that the function always returns True if `stdout` is not empty, regardless of the table name being in the `stdout` string.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the table name is present in the `stdout` string and then return True or False accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_spec))

        return table in stdout
```

By checking if the table name is present in the `stdout` variable for the second condition, we ensure that the function returns the correct value based on the existence of the table.
