The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it performs case-sensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table. This causes the function to fail when the table name casing in the database is different than the casing used in the function call. To fix this, the `table_exists` function needs to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the names retrieved from the database.

To address this issue, the `table_exists` function should convert both the provided table name and the table names retrieved from the database to lower case before performing the comparison. This will ensure that the function behaves in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions from the class

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function now uses case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table, which should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue raised in the GitHub reports.
