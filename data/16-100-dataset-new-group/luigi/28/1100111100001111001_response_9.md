The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check whether a table exists in a given database, with an optional partition specification. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute HiveQL commands and check if the table exists based on the output. 

Upon analysis of the provided runtime and expected values for the function, it is evident that the bug lies in the logic used to determine table existence, specifically when checking for the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug seems to be in the condition:

```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```

This condition may not work as intended, as it doesn't explicitly handle "table not found" cases.

A potential strategy to fix the bug is to modify the logic for checking table existence in the `table_exists` function. An improved approach might be to check if the table name exists in the `stdout` while also explicitly checking for the presence of the table name in `stdout`. If the table name is found, the function should return `True`, indicating that the table exists. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```
