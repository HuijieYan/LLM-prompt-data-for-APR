The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive when it checks if a table exists in the Hive database. This causes issues when some table names are capitalized and others are not.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive and resolving the issue reported on GitHub. It should now pass the failing tests and address the reported bug.
