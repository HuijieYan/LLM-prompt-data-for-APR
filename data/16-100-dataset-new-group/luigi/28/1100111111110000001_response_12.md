The buggy function `table_exists` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` produces incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table with or without a partition. This has been confirmed by the failing test `test_table_exists` in the file `test/contrib/hive_test.py`. 

The problem occurs when the function creates the command to check for the existence of a table with or without a partition. More specifically, it fails to build the command properly when a partition is provided. 

The failing test function `test_table_exists` is failing because it's asserting that the function should return `True` when checking the existence of the table, but it actually returns `False`, leading to an `AssertionError` as indicated in the error message.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to correctly build the command to check for the existence of a table with or without a partition. We will update the `if partition is None` block to return `True` if stdout is not `None` and the table is in the stdout. In the `else` block, we will correctly build the command using `self.partition_spec(partition)`.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout is not None and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, ",".join("{}={}".format(k,v) for k, v in partition.items())))
        return stdout is not None
```
