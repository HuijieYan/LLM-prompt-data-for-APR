## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            formatted_partition = ', '.join("{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items())
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, formatted_partition))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The issue with the previous code was that the `self.partition_spec(partition)` call was not properly formatting the partition specification. The corrected version properly formats the partition specification using a dictionary comprehension and then combines them into a comma-separated string.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and correctly handle table existence checks, including when a partition specification is provided.
