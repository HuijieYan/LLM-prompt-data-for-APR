The issue with the buggy function `table_exists` is that it does not handle the case-sensitivity of table names properly. The function uses the `show tables like` command in Hive, which is case-insensitive, but then checks if the exact table name is in the result, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to handle the case-insensitivity of the table names properly. We can also improve the implementation to handle the partitioned table case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other class methods
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
        else:
            partition_clause = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}""".format(database, table))
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(partition_clause in p for p in partitions)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now handles case-insensitive comparison of table names and also correctly checks for existing partitions in the case of a partitioned table. This should resolve the failing tests.
