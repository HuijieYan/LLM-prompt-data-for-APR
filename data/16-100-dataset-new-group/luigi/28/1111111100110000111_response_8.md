## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is not case insensitive, which causes the failing test cases. The issue on GitHub #896 and the description point out that the function needs to be made case insensitive.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location is within the comparison of `table` with the output `stdout`. The comparison does not take case insensitivity into account.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` not being case insensitive. The failing test cases indicate that upper and lower case variations of table names are causing the tests to fail, as the comparison is case sensitive.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing.

## Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Make the comparison case insensitive
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive with `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function is now able to pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue raised in GitHub.
