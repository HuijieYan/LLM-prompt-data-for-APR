To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before the comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and address the issue reported on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will compare the lowercase versions of both the table name and the stdout, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive. This corrected version will now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issues posted on GitHub.

This fix addresses the problem highlighted in the GitHub issue by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive, as suggested.
