The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly checking for the existence of the table or partition in the database. The `stdout` variable is being used to check the existence of the table/partition, but it is not being handled properly in all cases.

In Case 1 and Case 4, the function should return True if the table exists, but the check `return stdout and table in stdout` is not handling the case where the table name is a substring of another table name in the `stdout`. For example, in Case 2, the table "mytable" is being found because "mytable" is a substring of "MyTable".

In Case 3 and Case 6, the logic for checking partition existence is also incorrect. The function returns True if `stdout` is not None, without actually checking the specific partition. This is incorrect because `stdout` contains a list of partitions, and it should be checked for the existence of the specific partition in the list.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to use a more precise check for table and partition existence. The function should return True only if the exact table/partition is found in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(partition.items() <= parse_partition(part) for part in stdout.split('\n'))

def parse_partition(self, part):
    return dict(item.split('=') for item in part.split('/'))
```

In the corrected version, the `stdout` is split by newline characters to get a list of tables/partitions. Then, for tables and partitions, we use the `in` keyword to check for the exact match. Additionally, a new function `parse_partition` is added to parse the partition strings.
