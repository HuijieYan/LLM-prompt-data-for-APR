The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking if a table exists in Hive. The GitHub issue confirms this by stating that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns the table names in lower case, causing the test to fail. To fix this, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by using the `lower()` method on both `table` and `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this change, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` is now case-insensitive, and the function should work as expected.
