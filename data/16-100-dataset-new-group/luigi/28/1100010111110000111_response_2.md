The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This causes the test to fail when the table names have different cases.

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we should update the comparison to use the lower case version of the table names when checking against the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using the lower case versions of both the table name and the `stdout` output, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will work correctly in scenarios that involve different cases.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
