The bug in the function `table_exists` is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This issue is acknowledged in the GitHub issue with the title "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".

The function `table_exists` needs to be modified to handle case insensitivity when comparing the table names.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return any(p.lower() == self.partition_spec(partition).lower() for p in partitions)
```

This corrected function checks for table existence by comparing the lowercase version of both the provided table name and the tables retrieved from the Hive database. This approach ensures that case differences do not affect the result of the table existence check, resolving the issue reported in the failing test cases and the GitHub issues.

With this corrected version, the test functions provided in the Github issue should all pass successfully.
