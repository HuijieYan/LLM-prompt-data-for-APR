To fix the given buggy function, we need to address the following issues:
1. The conditional statements are not handling the stdout correctly.
2. The use of `run_hive_cmd` is not defined, so we need to assume its implementation for the fix.

Based on these issues, we can implement a corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return 'OK' in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return 'OK' in stdout.splitlines()
```

In the corrected version, we've replaced the conditional statements with a check for 'OK' in the stdout. We assume that the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the output of the hive command as a string. Then, we split the string into lines and check if 'OK' is present in any of the lines to determine if the table exists.

This should address the issues and satisfy the expected input/output values.
