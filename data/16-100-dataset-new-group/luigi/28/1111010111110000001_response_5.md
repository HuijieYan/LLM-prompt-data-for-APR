The potential error location in the `table_exists` function is with the stdout check. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` will return True if `stdout` is not empty, regardless of whether the table exists within `stdout`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly check for the existence of the table based on the `stdout` output of the hive command. The failing test verifies that the function does not return the expected result, resulting in AssertionError.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should use the `in` operator to check if `table` exists in `stdout` and return `True` only if it does. Additionally, the condition to check for an empty `stdout` should be implemented correctly. This will ensure that the function checks for the existence of the table based on the output of the hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the existence of the `table` in `stdout` is checked using the `in` operator, and both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity. The condition to check for an empty `stdout` has also been simplified to return `bool(stdout)`. This ensures that the function returns the correct result based on the output of the hive command.
