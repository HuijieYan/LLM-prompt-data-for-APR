The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug that causes the test to fail with an `AssertionError: False is not true`.

The bug is likely due to the incorrect construction of the query when the `partition` parameter is not None. The query passed to `run_hive_cmd` is malformed and not filtering the table according to the specified partition.

To resolve the bug, the query construction should be fixed to properly handle the case when `partition` is not None.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_filter = " and ".join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} where {partition_filter};")
            return bool(stdout)
```
