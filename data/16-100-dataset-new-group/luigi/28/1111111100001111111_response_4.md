### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug appears to be related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The proposed fix from the GitHub issue is to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by checking the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the stdout. Therefore, the recommended strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" %
                (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
