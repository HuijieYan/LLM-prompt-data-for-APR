The bug in the table_exists function is caused by the comparison ignoring case sensitivity. The issue was identified on GitHub and it has been acknowledged. The fix involves modifying the comparison to be case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function converts both the table name and the output to lower case before performing the comparison, thus making it case insensitive. This change should resolve the failing tests and align with the GitHub issue for fixing the bug.
