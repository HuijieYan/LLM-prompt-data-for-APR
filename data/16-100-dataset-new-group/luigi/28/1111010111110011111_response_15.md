The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class, and it is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. However, the issue arises when the function tries to compare the table name in a case-sensitive manner, leading to failing test cases and an assertion error.

The potential error location in the buggy function is with the comparison check using the `in` keyword, and the failure to account for case sensitivity.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not accounting for case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the Hive database, leading to inconsistent results and failing test cases. This is evident from the failing test message which indicates that the returned value does not match the expected value due to case sensitivity issues. The GitHub issues also confirm that the function should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison check to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, making the comparison case-insensitive. This modification will ensure that the function's behavior aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
