The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a database. 

The potential error in the function is when checking if the table exists in the `stdout` variable. The return condition for `table in stdout` is causing the bug.

The cause of the bug is that the function is checking for the presence of the table name as a whole in the `stdout`, but in reality, it could just be a part of a larger response. This causes the incorrect outputs in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we should search for the whole word "table" in the `stdout` to avoid matching partial strings.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This modification splits the `stdout` into lines and checks for the exact match of the `table` name in the `stdout`. This should address the bug and make the function work as expected.
