The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence. This causes the failing test cases where the table names are not in the same case as the input to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function will now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub about making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
