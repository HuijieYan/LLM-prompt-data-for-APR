Based on the provided context, it seems that the issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This behavior is causing the failing tests. It's expected to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive when comparing the table names in the stdout of the Hive command.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. Also, the new implementation should handle cases when the partition is set to None. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function checks for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the failing tests and addressing the issue raised on GitHub.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
