The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns the opposite of what it should return in the if and else statements. When `stdout` is not empty, it should return `True`, but instead, it returns `False`. When `stdout` is empty, it should return `False`, but it returns `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the return statements in the if and else parts of the function so that the correct values are returned based on the conditions.

```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient:
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we directly return the result of the condition `stdout and table in stdout` for the first case, and `bool(stdout)` for the second case. This will ensure that the function returns the correct boolean values according to the conditions.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and yield the expected output values and types.
