### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The fix involves making the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for existence.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function uses lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout in the comparison, making it case insensitive. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
