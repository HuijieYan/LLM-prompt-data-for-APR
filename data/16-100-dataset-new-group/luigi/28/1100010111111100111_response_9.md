### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. The function should compare the table name case-insensitively with the tables found in the database. Based on the test failures and the GitHub issues, the fix can be achieved by modifying the comparison operation to use the lowercased version of the table names.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected function uses `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table. This modification addresses the issue described in the GitHub reports and ensures that the function works correctly in scenarios with different table name cases.
