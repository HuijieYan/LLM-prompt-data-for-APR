The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd()` function, leading to incorrect evaluation of table existence.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function correctly handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd()` function and accurately determines the existence of the table based on the provided query.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}".format(database, table))
        
        return any(partition.items() <= dict(item.split('=') for item in line.split('/')).items() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

In the corrected version, we use the `split()` method to separate the output from `run_hive_cmd()` into individual lines and then evaluate the table existence based on the split output. Similarly, for the partition, we split the lines and then evaluate the existence of the specified partition.
