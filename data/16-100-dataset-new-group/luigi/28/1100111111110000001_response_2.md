The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling the case when `stdout` is an empty string correctly. When `stdout` is empty, the function should return False, indicating that the table does not exist. However, the function does not account for this case and instead returns `True` regardless of the value of `stdout`.

To fix this, we need to check if the `stdout` is empty, and if it is, return False. Otherwise, proceed with the current logic.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout.strip():  # Check for empty string and handle it
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, I have added a check for an empty string using the `strip` method. If `stdout` is empty, it will evaluate to `False` and return `False` indicating that the table does not exist. If `stdout` is not empty, the function will operate as before, checking for the presence of the table in the output.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
