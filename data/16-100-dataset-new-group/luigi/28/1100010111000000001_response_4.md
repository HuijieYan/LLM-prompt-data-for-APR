After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, it can be identified that the potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect conditional check based on the `stdout` value.
2. Incorrect use of format and string concatenation in the function.

The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` does not properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the condition checks do not return the correct results based on the output.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should correctly handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` and return the appropriate Boolean value based on the presence of the table or partition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_cmd))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return bool(partitions)
```

In this corrected version, the output from `run_hive_cmd` is split based on the newline character and then checked for the presence of the table or partition, and the correct Boolean value is returned. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
