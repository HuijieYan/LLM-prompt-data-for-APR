The bug in the table_exists function is that it incorrectly checks for the existence of a table in the given database and partition. The bug occurs in the conditional statements for checking stdout and the presence of the table or partition. The function should check for the existence of the table in the database and optionally in the specified partition.

The buggy function incorrectly checks if stdout is not empty to determine if the table exists. However, in Case 2 and Case 5, the table name may appear as part of a larger string, causing the function to return an incorrect value. Additionally, in Case 3 and Case 6, the partition_spec method is called with a dictionary input, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to explicitly check for the table in stdout by splitting the lines and checking for the exact match of the table name. It should also handle the partition parameter appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            table_list = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in table_list
        else:
            partition_str = '/'.join([f"{key}={value}" for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str});")
            return bool(stdout)
```
