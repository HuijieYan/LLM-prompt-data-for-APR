The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive, causing the test cases to fail for capitalization discrepancies. The issue on GitHub discusses this problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue, making it case insensitive.
