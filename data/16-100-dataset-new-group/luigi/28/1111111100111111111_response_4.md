The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to return the correct output because it is not case insensitive. The function checks for the existence of a table in Hive and returns false when it should be true due to case sensitivity issues.

The issue on GitHub (#896) indicates that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive, and the proposed solution is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to check for the existence of the table in a case insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the modified function, the `table` and `stdout` values are compared in a case insensitive manner using the `lower()` method. This will address the case sensitivity issue and resolve the failing test cases.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also aligns with the suggested solution provided in the GitHub issue.
