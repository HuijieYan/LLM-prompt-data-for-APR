The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a given database. It takes input parameters `table` (string), `database` (string), and `partition` (optional).

The potential error in the code is in the conditional check for `partition`. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which is supposed to return a result from running a Hive command.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the mishandling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the current implementation, the function does not properly handle the case where the table exists or where a specific partition of the table exists. This leads to incorrect return values in some cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional checks and the handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. We should also ensure that the function returns `True` when the table or partition exists, and `False` when it does not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return 'OK' in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return 'OK' in stdout
```

In this corrected version, we properly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and return `True` if 'OK' is in the output, indicating that the table or partition exists, and `False` otherwise. This should satisfy all the expected input/output values.
