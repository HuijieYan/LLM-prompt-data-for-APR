## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

1. Analysis: The buggy function is checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database with the provided parameters. It uses a conditional statement to handle the case of checking for the existence of a partition as well.
2. Potential Error Locations: The string formatting in the function may be incorrect, leading to errors in constructing the Hive commands.
3. Cause of the Bug: The bug may be caused by incorrect string formatting and construction of the Hive commands, leading to incorrect queries being sent to the Hive database.
4. Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug: Use proper string formatting and construction of the Hive commands to accurately query the Hive database for the existence of tables and partitions.

The corrected version of the function uses proper string formatting and construction of the Hive commands to accurately query the Hive database for the existence of tables and partitions. It also includes the correct syntax for showing tables and partitions in the Hive database.
