To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly checks for the existence of a table in the database. It seems that the buggy function is not properly handling the case when a table exists.

The bug seems to be in the way the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which retrieves information from the Hive database. The function expects to find the table name in the output in order to determine if the table exists, but it's not correctly handling the presence of the table name in the output.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and check if the table name exists in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return len(stdout.strip()) > 0
```

In this corrected version, we use the `split` method to convert the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function into a list of table names, and then check if the specified table is in that list. For the case with partitions, we check if the length of the output is greater than 0 to determine if the table exists.

With these changes, the function should now properly handle the outputs of the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the correct boolean value indicating whether the table exists.

This corrected version should pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
