## The source code of the corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase, the corrected function ensures that case sensitivity is handled when checking for the existence of tables. This updated approach resolves the issue raised in the GitHub post and aligns with the expected behavior stated in the failing test cases.
