## Analysis
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug related to case sensitivity. It fails to check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, which causes the failing test cases due to case mismatch between the table name and the output from stdout.

The failing test case checks the `table_exists` function with different table names and partitions. The failure occurs when the expected table name and the table name retrieved from stdout do not match due to case sensitivity.

The provided GitHub issues highlight the problem, suggesting that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive to avoid issues with the case mismatch between table names.

## Potential Error Locations
The error occurs due to the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`. The error most likely exists in the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function, where the table name and the output from stdout are being compared directly.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the direct comparison of the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. If the table name is not in the same case as the actual name stored in the database, the comparison will fail, leading to the buggy behavior. The failing test demonstrates this problem by checking with different table names and their respective case sensitivity.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase (or uppercase) before performing the comparison.

## Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` has been made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison. This modification addresses the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issues, ensuring that the `table_exists` function is now case insensitive.
