The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of table names being case sensitive, causing test cases to fail. The buggy function needs to be fixed to make the comparison case insensitive. The issue has been identified in GitHub, and a pull request related to the issue has been suggested.

In the `table_exists` function, the comparison of the table name from the stdout with the input table name causes the failing test cases. The issue arises because the comparison is case sensitive, and the provided table names might be in different cases than the ones returned by the hive command, resulting in test failures.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` ensures that the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive for table existence. This correction aligns with the suggestions provided in the GitHub issue.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable values. It also resolves the GitHub issue related to making the table_exists function case insensitive.
