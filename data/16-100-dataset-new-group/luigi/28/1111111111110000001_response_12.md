The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check for the existence of a table in a Hive database, with a particular partition if specified. The failing test `test_table_exists` checks for the expected behavior of the `table_exists` function. The error message indicates that the bug is causing the function to return `False` when it should be returning `True` for the specified test case. The failing test `test_table_exists` includes test cases for both a regular table search and a partitioned table search.

The bug is likely in the `table_exists` function, where the logic for checking the existence of the table is flawed. When the `if` statement is used to check for the presence of a partition, the string formatting and arguments passed to `run_hive_cmd` could be incorrect. This is causing the function to return the incorrect result, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `table_exists` function should be reviewed and updated to properly handle the cases where a partition is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_condition = ' and '.join([f'{key} = "{value}"' for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_condition})')

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the previously failing test cases.
