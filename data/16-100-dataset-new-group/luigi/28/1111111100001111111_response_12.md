The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking for an existing table in Hive. The issue on GitHub suggests that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lowercase, causing the test to fail.

The buggy function `table_exists` should return True if the table exists, regardless of case, and False if it doesn't exist.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This correction will make the function case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue, and ensure that it returns the correct result based on the existence of the table in Hive.
