Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issues, the bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the table name when checking for its existence in the `table_exists` function. The function does not account for case differences between the input table name and the table name returned from the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the input table name and the table name from `stdout` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the input table name and the table names from the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub reports.
