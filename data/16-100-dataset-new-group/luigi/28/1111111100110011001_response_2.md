The bug in the function `table_exists` is caused by using the `and` operator when checking if the `stdout` is empty or not, which doesn't account for a new line character. When `stdout` is equal to `"OK"`, the buggy function returns `True`, but when `stdout` is equal to `"OK\nmytable"`, the function incorrectly returns `False`, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition for checking if `table` is in `stdout` to properly account for the new line character. Additionally, we need to remove the unnecessary `if` statement and simplify the code to return the result of the condition directly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other functions ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.strip().split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

The correction involves using `.strip().split('\n')` to handle both cases of a single line output and a multi-line output. Additionally, in the else block, we can directly return `bool(stdout.strip())` to check if the stdout is empty or not.
