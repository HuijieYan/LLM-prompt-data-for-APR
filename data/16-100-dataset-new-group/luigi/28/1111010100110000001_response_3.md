The bug in the `table_exists` method exists when the `partition` argument is not None. This causes the method to fail because it doesn't handle the partitions correctly.

The reason for the bug is that the buggy function does not properly format the Hive command when a partition is specified. It calculates the stdout based on the existence of the output without properly checking for the table in the stdout.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the command formatting and the stdout check to ensure that the table is present in the stdout when a partition is specified.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
```

In this corrected version, f-strings are used for formatting the Hive commands, and the `stdout` check has been modified to properly check for the table existence based on the stdout.
