The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the partition condition correctly. When the partition is not None, it is not constructing the command string properly and the logic to check for the existence of a table in a partition is incorrect.

The bug is causing the failing test `test_table_exists` to fail because it's not returning the expected result when a partition is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to properly handle the case where a partition is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout and 'OK' in stdout
```

This corrected version ensures that the correct command string is constructed when a partition is provided, and the logic for checking the existence of a table within a partition is also fixed.

With this corrected version, the failing test `test_table_exists` should now pass.
