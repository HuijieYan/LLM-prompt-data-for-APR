The buggy function is the `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function is supposed to check if a given table exists in a given database and partition, but it returns incorrect results in some cases.

The potential error locations within the function are the conditional statements within the `table_exists` function. The implementation of the conditions for checking the existence of the table and partition are incorrect.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect use of string formatting and conditionals within the `table_exists` function. The failing test checks the functionality of the `table_exists` function by setting mock return values for the `run_hive_cmd` function and then asserting the result of the `table_exists` function. The error message indicates that the assertion is failing for certain cases, suggesting that the `table_exists` function is not returning the expected results.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional statements within the `table_exists` function and ensure that the function processes the input correctly. We also need to potentially fix the way the `mock.patch` decorator is being used in the failing test to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is mocked properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)});")
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the string formatting is done using f-strings for better readability and proper interpolation of variables into the command strings. Additionally, the result for the conditionals has been changed to correctly compare and process the outputs of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
