Based on the code, test, error message, and GitHub issue, it is evident that the `table_exists` function is failing because it is case-sensitive and is not properly handling the table names. The issue reported in GitHub also confirms that the function should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This will ensure that the function is case insensitive and will correctly identify the table existence regardless of the case used.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle the case insensitivity of table names and pass the failing test cases. Additionally, this fix aligns with the GitHub issue reporting the same problem and suggestion for resolution.
