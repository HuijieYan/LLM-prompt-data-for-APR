Based on the information provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes issues when tables are defined with capitalized names but returned as lower case by Hive.

The buggy function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of a table. The issue on GitHub suggests that the function should check `stdout` (the output of the Hive command) against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simplify the return statement
    
```

In the corrected version, we use `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` to perform a case insensitive check for the existence of the table in the Hive command output. We also simplify the if-else statement to directly return the boolean value of `stdout`.

This fix addresses the issue reported on the GitHub thread and ensures that the `table_exists` function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
