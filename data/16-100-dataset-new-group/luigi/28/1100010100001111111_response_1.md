The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue where it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The bug is related to GitHub issues #896 and #919, which suggest making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

The bug occurs when the table name has a different case from the one returned by the Hive database. The function does not handle case sensitivity, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the table names returned by Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function compares the lowercase versions of both the table name and the output from the Hive database, making the comparison case insensitive. This fix will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bugs #896 and #919.
