The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the logic for checking whether a table exists is incorrect. Specifically, when the `partition` parameter is provided, the `stdout` value is not being properly checked. This is evident from the failing tests and the corresponding error messages.

One potential fix for this bug is to change the condition in the `else` block to check if the table name is present in the `stdout` when a partition is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout
```

After making this fix, the provided failing tests should pass.
