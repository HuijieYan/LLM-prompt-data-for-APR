The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle the case-insensitive comparison of table names correctly. The function is comparing the table names using a simple string comparison, which fails for case-insensitive comparisons.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. We can convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version uses the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
