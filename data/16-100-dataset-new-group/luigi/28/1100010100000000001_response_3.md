## Analysis of the buggy function
The function table_exists is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It takes the table name, database name, and an optional partition as arguments. It then runs a Hive command to check for the existence of the table. 

## Identification of potential error locations
1. The use of the run_hive_cmd function is not defined within the buggy function, so it may be causing the error.
2. The string formatting and partition condition may also have errors.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The bug could be caused by an undefined or incorrectly used run_hive_cmd function. Additionally, the string formatting and partition condition could be incorrect, leading to incorrect results or errors.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Define or import the run_hive_cmd function to use it within the table_exists function.
2. Update the string formatting and partition condition to ensure they are correctly formatted and handled.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
