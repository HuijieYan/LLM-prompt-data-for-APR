The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the following line of code:

```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
```

The issue is with the format string "%s" being used to format the SQL query. Since the `self.partition_spec(partition)` evaluates to a string, it should not be placed inside the parentheses of the `show partitions` command.

To fix the bug, we should modify the line to separate the database, table, and partition in the query and remove the unnecessary "partition" keyword:

```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
```

This change ensures that the SQL query is constructed correctly and prevents the failing test cases from causing an assertion error.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
        return bool(stdout)
```
