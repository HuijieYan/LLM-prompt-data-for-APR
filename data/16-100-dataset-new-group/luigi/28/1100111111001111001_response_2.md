The bug is likely caused by the `table_exists` function not properly handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `run_hive_cmd` function returns the output of a Hive command, and the `table_exists` function is trying to parse that output to determine if a table exists.

Based on the failing tests and expected values, it seems that the `table_exists` function is not properly handling the case where a table does exist. It is returning the opposite boolean value of what is expected.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to properly handle the case where a table exists. We can do this by checking if the table name is present in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should handle the case where a table exists and return the expected boolean values for all the failing tests.
