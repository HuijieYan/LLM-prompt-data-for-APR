The problem with the current `table_exists` function is that it directly compares the table name provided to the names returned from the `run_hive_cmd`. This causes issues with case sensitivity of table names in Hive, which is highlighted in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to ensure that it compares the table name in a case-insensitive manner by lowercasing both the table name and the results returned from `run_hive_cmd`.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the returned table names, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

This updated function should now satisfy all the failing test cases and the expected input/output values, and also resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
