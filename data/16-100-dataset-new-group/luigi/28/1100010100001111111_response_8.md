The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. It needs to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the tables returned in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the tables returned in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the tables returned in the `stdout`, thus resolving the case sensitivity issue raised in the GitHub issue.
