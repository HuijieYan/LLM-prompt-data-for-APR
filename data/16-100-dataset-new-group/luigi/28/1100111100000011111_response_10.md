# The buggy function is `table_exists` which checks if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue is that the function doesn't handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the tables returned from the `show tables` Hive command. The bug was raised as a GitHub issue and a suggested fix was provided to make the comparison case insensitive.

# The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparisons where the table name is compared with the tables returned from the Hive commands.

# The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the tables returned from the `show tables` Hive command. This leads to issues when 'FooBar' is compared with 'foobar' or 'FooBar' with 'foobar' due to the case sensitivity.

# A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparisons to be case insensitive by converting the table names to lowercase before comparing them with the tables returned from the Hive commands.

# Given the analysis and the suggested fix, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
The corrected version of the function makes the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison. This satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the GitHub issue.
