The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity. The function is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive, which causes the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by case differences.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix addresses the issue posted in GitHub by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
