The buggy function `table_exists` is meant to check if a given table exists in the Hive database. The issue seems to be in the `if partition is None` block and the `else` block in the function.

It appears that the issue is with the condition check and how the function processes the standard output of the `run_hive_cmd` function call.

The cause of the bug is the misinterpretation of the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The original function checks if the output `stdout` is "true" or "false", but it doesn't seem to handle partial and complete nature of the output correctly (ex: "OK\nmytable").

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to process the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly and handle the conditions for both 'if partition is None' and 'else' blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # other methods...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_condition = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {database}; show partitions {table} {partition_condition};'.format(database=database, table=table, partition_condition=partition_condition))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the problem should be resolved and the failing tests should pass.
