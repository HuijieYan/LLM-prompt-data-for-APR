The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be in the condition that checks the existence of the table. It seems that the function is incorrectly returning True even when the table doesn't exist. This is based on the failing test cases and the provided runtime values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function returns False when the table does not exist. We can do this by updating the condition and the return statements.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Check if the stdout is not empty and return True, else return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
