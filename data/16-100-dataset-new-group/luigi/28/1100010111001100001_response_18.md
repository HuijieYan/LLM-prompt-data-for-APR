The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be that it is not correctly checking for the existence of a table and its partitions in the Hive database.

The first issue is that when no partition is provided, the function checks if the table exists in the default database, but it should also check the provided database.

The second issue is with checking for the partitions. The current implementation does not seem to correctly identify whether the partitions exist or not.

Additionally, the function returns different values for the presence of the table and partitions, which might be contributing to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle checking for the existence of the table in the specified database, as well as checking for the existence of the partitions if provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0};
                                show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the function checks for the existence of the table in the specified database and returns the presence of the table directly. For partitions, it checks the existence and returns a boolean value accordingly. These changes should address the issues and make the function work as intended.
