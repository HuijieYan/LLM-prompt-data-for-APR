The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with the conditional logic and the `stdout` variable assignment. When the `partition` argument is not None, the function does not correctly check for the existence of the table. The `stdout` variable assignment and the subsequent conditional check are not handling the output as expected, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles both cases - when `partition` is None and when it is not None. We should also ensure that the `stdout` variable contains the expected output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, and then perform the conditional checks accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the code to correctly handle the `stdout` and the conditional checks for both cases. This version should pass the failing tests.
