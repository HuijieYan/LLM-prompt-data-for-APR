The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is not handling the different cases of inputs properly, leading to failing tests. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of the `stdout` values and how the conditionals are structured.

For the function `table_exists`, when `partition` is `None`, the function is expected to return `True` if the table exists, and `False` if it does not. However, for the current implementation, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not adequate for this purpose. In the other case where `partition` is not `None`, the handling of the `stdout` is also not appropriate.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements inside the `table_exists` function need to be modified to correctly interpret the `stdout` values.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table  # Remove leading/trailing whitespace and compare directly
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        
        return partition_spec in stdout  # Check if the partition_spec is present in the stdout
```

In the corrected version:
- For the case where `partition` is `None`, we compare the stripped `stdout` (without leading/trailing whitespace) directly to the table name, returning `True` if they are equal.
- For the other case, we ensure that the `partition_spec` is present in the `stdout` by using the `in` operator. This simplifies the logic and ensures the correct output for varied inputs.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
