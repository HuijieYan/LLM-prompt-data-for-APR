The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a database with or without a specific partition. The issue lies in the second condition of the function, where the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with a complex SQL statement.

The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. The string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` call in the `table_exists` function might be incorrect.
2. The `self.partition_spec(partition)` call might be returning an unexpected value.

The cause of the bug is that the SQL statement being passed to `run_hive_cmd` in the `table_exists` function is not properly formatted, and this could result in a syntax error when executing the Hive command. Additionally, if the `self.partition_spec(partition)` function is not returning the expected partition specification string, it could cause the `run_hive_cmd` call to fail.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to:
1. Ensure that the SQL statement passed to `run_hive_cmd` in the `table_exists` function is formatted correctly with the appropriate database, table, and partition information.
2. Verify that the `self.partition_spec(partition)` function is returning the correct partition specification string.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_string = ','.join(['{0}="{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_string))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the SQL statements passed to `run_hive_cmd` are formatted using Python string formatting to ensure the correct syntax. Additionally, the partition specification string is constructed using the `partition` dictionary passed to the function. The last conditional statement is simplified to return `bool(stdout)` directly, avoiding unnecessary if-else checks.
