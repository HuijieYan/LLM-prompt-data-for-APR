To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to check if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner by comparing the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the table name is converted to lowercase and then checked for existence in the lowercase `stdout`. The `stdout` variable is also directly used in the boolean return statement instead of having a separate check.

This corrected version will address the case insensitivity issue and pass the failing test cases, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
