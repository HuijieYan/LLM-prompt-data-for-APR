The bug in the code is that the table name is not being compared in a case-insensitive manner, causing tests to fail when the case of the table name does not match the case returned by the Hive query.

To fix the bug, modify the comparison to be case insensitive, converting both the table name and the output of the Hive query to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive, the function should now work as expected and pass the failing tests.
