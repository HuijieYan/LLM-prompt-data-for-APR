The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to how the `stdout` variable is being checked for the existence of the table. The function is returning the opposite of what is expected in the test cases, indicating a logical error.

The bug is occurring because the function is returning `table in stdout` for the first case and `not stdout` for the second case, which is the opposite of what should be returned.

To fix the bug, we should adjust the conditions to correctly check for the existence of the table in the `stdout` variable, and return `True` if the table exists, and `False` if it does not.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
