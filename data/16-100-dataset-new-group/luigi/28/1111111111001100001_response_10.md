The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be caused by the incorrect use of `self.partition_spec(partition)` in the `run_hive_cmd` call within the function.

The `self.partition_spec(partition)` call is intended to generate a partition specification string, but the way it is used in the `run_hive_cmd` call doesn't seem appropriate. It appears that the function is trying to embed the `self.partition_spec(partition)` invocation directly into the string, but the code is missing the necessary formatting.

The correction strategy would be to properly format the `self.partition_spec(partition)` result into the `run_hive_cmd` call to ensure its inclusion in the command string.

A corrected version of the `table_exists` function is provided below:

```python
# Import necessary library
import re

# The declaration of the corrected class containing the fixed function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.run_hive_cmd = run_hive_cmd  # Initialize the run_hive_cmd function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd(
                "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, a new variable `partition_str` is created to properly format the partition specification string. The formatted `partition_str` is then used in the `run_hive_cmd` call. This should fix the bug and ensure that the tests pass.
