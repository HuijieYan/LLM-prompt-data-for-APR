The buggy function `table_exists` from `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly passing the test cases. It is returning wrong boolean values for each condition. The issue arises from the `table_exists` function, which uses `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` to check if a table exists with specified parameters but it did not return the expected result.

The bug in the `table_exists` function is that for the first branch of the condition, it returns `table in stdout`, whereas it should be checking whether `stdout` contains the table name.

Secondly, in the else branch, it always returns `True` which is incorrect. It should check for the existence of the specified partition and return accordingly.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the stdout properly after the command execution and check for the existence of the table or partition based on the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ' AND '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
