After analyzing the provided information, it is evident that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. The issue on GitHub discusses how the table_exists function fails when checking for the existence of a table with capitalized names in Hive, as Hive returns table names in lowercase. The suggested fix is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

To fix the bug, we will modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions in the class...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, we convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them using the `lower()` function. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue identified in the GitHub discussions.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function should now work correctly with case-sensitive table names in Hive.
