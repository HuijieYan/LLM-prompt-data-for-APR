The buggy function has an issue with the `table_exists` method wherein it does not return the correct output based on the inputs provided. The issue is that the function does not properly handle the case when the table exists in the database. Additionally, the function has incorrect logic when handling the `partition` parameter, resulting in the wrong return value.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the `table_exists` function to properly handle the cases for both table existence and partitions.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition
                            ({3})""".format(database, database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # This will return True if stdout is not empty, and False if it is empty
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles both cases of table existence and partition existence, and the return values are updated based on the expected behavior.
