The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the function not being case insensitive when checking for table existence. The bug is exemplified in the GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?", where it is mentioned that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lower case, causing the test to fail.

The suggested fix from the GitHub issue provides the solution by proposing to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

So, to fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to be case insensitive. Here's the corrected version based on the suggestion:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring the function is case insensitive and will accurately determine the existence of the table regardless of the case used in its definition in Hive.
