The potential error locations within the `table_exists` function are the comparisons `table in stdout` and `table, partition in stdout`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is case sensitive and does not convert both `table` and `stdout` to the same case before comparing them. This causes the test to fail when the case of the table does not match the case of the table name in the output from Hive.

To fix the bug, we need to convert both `table` and `stdout` to the same case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and fix the failing test.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
