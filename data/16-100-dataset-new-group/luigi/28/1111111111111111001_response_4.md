The function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a Hive database. However, the bug is in the way it processes the Hive commands and checks for the existence of the table.

The first issue is in the implementation of the `table_exists` function. When a partition is provided, it calls `run_hive_cmd` with a command that includes the result of `self.partition_spec(partition)`. This is incorrect as it should be using `partition` directly.

The second issue is that the function is incorrectly checking if the table exists in the Hive database. When `run_hive_cmd` returns a non-empty string, the function returns `True` if a table exists in the output, and `False` otherwise. However, it is not correctly parsing the output to determine table existence.

To fix these issues, we should:

1. Update the function to use the `partition` parameter directly when a partition is provided.

2. Parse the output of `run_hive_cmd` to check if the table exists.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            partition_string = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_string))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly check for the existence of a table in the Hive database, and handle the case where a partition is specified. This should make the failing test cases pass.
