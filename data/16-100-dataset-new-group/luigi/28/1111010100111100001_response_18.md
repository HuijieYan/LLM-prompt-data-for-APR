The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be caused by how it handles the `stdout` variable.

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking if the `stdout` string is truthy and then if the `table` is in the `stdout`. However, in the failing tests, the `stdout` string contains both "OK" and "mytable" concatenated, which causes the check to fail.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to check if the `table` is in the `stdout` string without relying on truthiness of `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
