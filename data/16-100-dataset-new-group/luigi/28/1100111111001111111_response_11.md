To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive when checking if a table exists. 

The problem with the current implementation is that it checks for an exact match between the table name and the output from the Hive query, without considering case sensitivity. This leads to test failures when the case of the table name in the query output does not match the input table name.

To fix this, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase and then check if it exists in the lowercase version of the query output. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify the existence of the table regardless of the case of the table name in the Hive query output.

This corrected version of the function should pass all the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
