Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to case insensitivity in the `table_exists` function. The function is not handling the case insensitivity correctly, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to update the `table_exists` function to handle case insensitivity as described in the GitHub issue and the failing test scenario.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With the corrected function, the case insensitivity issue should be resolved, and the failing test should pass. This change aligns with the fix proposed in the GitHub issue #896, which aims to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
