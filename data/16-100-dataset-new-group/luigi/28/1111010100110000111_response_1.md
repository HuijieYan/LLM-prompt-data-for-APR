### Identified potential error locations

1. The `table_exists` function is not handling case sensitivity properly.
2. The function is not taking into account the case-insensitive nature of Hive when checking for table existence.

### Cause of the bug

The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly. The function only checks if the table name is present in the output from the Hive command, but it does not perform a case-insensitive comparison.

The GitHub issue confirms that the behavior of `table_exists` is causing tests to fail due to case sensitivity issues in table names.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table name against the output from the Hive command. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly even when the table names have different cases.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the comparison of the table name and the stdout from the Hive command is done in a case-insensitive manner using `lower()` on both strings. This ensures that the function will correctly identify the existence of a table regardless of the case of the table name.
