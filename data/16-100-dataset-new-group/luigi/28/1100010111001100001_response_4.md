The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the `stdout` variable is handled, which leads to incorrect evaluation of whether a table exists in the database.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. In the first branch of the conditional statement, the function checks if the `stdout` value is not empty, and if the `table` exists in `stdout`. However, it does not handle the case when `stdout` contains the table name followed by other text.
2. In the second branch of the conditional statement, the function checks if `stdout` is not empty, but it doesn't handle what happens if `stdout` is not empty.

The cause of the bug is that the logic used to evaluate the presence of the table in the database is not adequate. The function simply checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` without considering the context.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly parse the `stdout` and ensure that it accurately determines whether the table exists in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split()  # Split the stdout and check if the table is present in the list
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simply return the boolean value of whether stdout is empty
```

By splitting the `stdout` and checking if the table is present in the list in the first branch, and directly returning the boolean value of whether `stdout` is empty in the second branch, the function will now accurately determine the existence of the table in the database.

After applying these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases.
