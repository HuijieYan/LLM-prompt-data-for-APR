The potential error in the `table_exists` function is in the conditional return statements. 

The bug causes the function to always return False for the `else` condition when checking for table existence based on partitions, regardless of the actual existence of the table. This bug causes the failing tests in both `hive_test.py` and `apacheclient_table_exists` to produce incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to correctly handle the case when checking for table existence based on partitions. We should also ensure that the function properly captures the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` and checks if the table exists based on the captured output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly determine the existence of a table based on partitions and return the expected result. This should make the failing tests in `hive_test.py` and `apacheclient_table_exists` pass successfully.
