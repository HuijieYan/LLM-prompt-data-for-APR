The bug in the provided function is that the `table_exists` method only checks if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, rather than implementing a proper check for existence.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function only checks for the existence of the table in the output, without taking into account the case when the table does not exist. This results in incorrect results being returned and the tests failing.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly check for the presence of the table in the output and return `True` if it exists, and `False` if it does not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected function: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')  # Check if the table name exists in the output
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if the stdout is not empty, indicating that the partition exists
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly checks for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and returns `True` if the table exists, and `False` otherwise.
