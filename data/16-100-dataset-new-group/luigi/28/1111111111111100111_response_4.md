To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase. This will ensure that the check is not affected by case differences and will make the function more robust.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this fix, the function now converts both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for table existence, ensuring that case differences do not affect the result.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, allowing it to pass the failing tests.
