The bug in the `table_exists` function is that there is no check for case insensitivity when checking if a table exists. This causes the function to return the wrong results for tables with different casing. 

The `table_exists` function is supposed to check if a given table exists in the specified database and partition. However, it does not handle case insensitivity properly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_filter = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_filter))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `lower` method to convert both the table name and the output from `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and fixes the bug.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
