The buggy function `table_exists` has a potential error location in the `else` block where it checks for the existence of a table with partitions. The condition `if stdout:` will only check if `stdout` is not empty, but it does not actually check if the table exists. 

The bug is caused by not properly checking for the existence of the table with partitions in the specified database and partition. The function returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty, regardless of whether the table with partitions actually exists.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to check the presence of the table with partitions in the specified database and partition. We can use the `SHOW PARTITIONS` command in Hive to achieve this.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and partition in stdout
```

In the corrected version, we have used the `SHOW PARTITIONS` command to check for the existence of the specified table with partitions in the specified database and partition. The function now returns `True` if the table with partitions exists, otherwise it returns `False`.
