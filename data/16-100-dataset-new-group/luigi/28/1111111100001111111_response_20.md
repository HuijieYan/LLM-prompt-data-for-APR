The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The issue can be fixed by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show table {1}".format(database, table))

            return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison, the function will be case-insensitive and the issue reported on GitHub will be resolved.
