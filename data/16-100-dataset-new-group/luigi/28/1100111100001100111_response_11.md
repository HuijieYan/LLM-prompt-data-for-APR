The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this problem, indicating that the function should be case insensitive when checking for an existing table in Hive. The function compares the table name directly with the stdout from the Hive command, leading to case sensitivity issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the stdout from the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison in a case-insensitive manner. This ensures that case sensitivity issues are properly handled, addressing the problem described in the GitHub issue.
