The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the `stdout` variable is being checked for the existence of the table. 

In the first condition, the `stdout` is checked as a truthy value to see if the table exists. However, in the second condition, the `stdout` is checked directly for its value, which may not accurately determine if the table exists.

To fix the bug, we can modify the second condition to check if the table name is in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})")

        return table in stdout
```

By making this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests.
