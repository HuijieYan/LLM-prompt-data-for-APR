The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the conditions used to determine the existence of a table in the database. The function `table_exists` takes in a table name, database name, and an optional partition, and then runs a query to check for the existence of the table.

The bug is that the function incorrectly checks for the presence of the table in the database based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and returns `True` or `False` based on whether the `stdout` variable is empty or not. This is not a reliable way to determine the existence of the table as the `stdout` might contain other information.

To fix this bug, the function should specifically check for the existence of the table in the `stdout` and return `True` only if the table is present, otherwise return `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')  # Check if table is in the stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simply return whether stdout is truthy or not
```
