The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue in the else branch where it makes a call to `run_hive_cmd` and passes the result of `self.partition_spec(partition)` as an argument. The function `self.partition_spec` is defined within the `HiveCommandClient` class but not within the scope of the `table_exists` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `self.partition_spec` function is called outside the class scope, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `partition_spec` function should be called using `self` within the `table_exists` function like this:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_query})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version calls the `self.partition_spec` function correctly within the `table_exists` function and constructs the partition query string using the returned value.
