The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the `table_exists` function. The first issue is that `run_hive_cmd` might not be correctly returning the expected output. The second issue is with the conditional statements - the logic may not be correctly handling the partition case.

The buggy function fails the test because it does not properly handle the different scenarios for table existence and partition existence. Additionally, the method of parsing the output from `run_hive_cmd` is problematic.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to properly handle the scenarios for table existence and partition existence. The function should accurately parse the output from `run_hive_cmd` and return the appropriate boolean values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
    tables = stdout.split('\n')

    if partition is None:
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} ( {2} )""".format(database, table,
                            self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return bool(partition in partitions)
```

In this corrected version, the stdout from the `show tables` command is split into individual tables and compared against the input table. Similarly, the stdout from the `show partitions` command is split into individual partitions and compared against the input partition. These comparisons return the appropriate boolean values.
