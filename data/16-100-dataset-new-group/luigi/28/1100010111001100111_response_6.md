The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. This leads to failing tests, as tables with different capitalization are not recognized as existing.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the stdout to make it case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This fixed version of the function should resolve the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub.
