The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not consider case sensitivity when checking the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive, which can cause issues when the table names are in a different case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive. The function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Existing functions
    ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        stdout = ""
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive. 

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and allows for case-insensitive table existence checks in the Hive database.
