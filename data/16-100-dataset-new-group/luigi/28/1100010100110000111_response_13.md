### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case insensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. This is causing the failing test cases and is also the subject of the GitHub issues.

The failing test is observing that the function is returning incorrect results when checking for table existence in a case-insensitive manner.

### Bug Locations
1. The `table_exists` function is not handling case insensitivity properly, leading to incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table.
2. The function is not converting the table name to lowercase when comparing it with the output from Hive, leading to false negatives in the test cases.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not handling case insensitivity correctly. When checking for the existence of a table, it is not converting the table name to lowercase, leading to incorrect results in case-insensitive comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that case insensitivity is handled correctly, and the function will return the expected results.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This ensures that case insensitivity is handled correctly, and the function will return the expected results.
