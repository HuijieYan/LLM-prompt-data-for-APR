The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. In some cases, tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lowercase, causing the function to return False when the table actually exists. This behavior is highlighted in the GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, the function needs to check if the lowercased table name exists in the lowercased `stdout`. 

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison is made to check for the existence of the table. This change ensures that the function is case insensitive and addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
