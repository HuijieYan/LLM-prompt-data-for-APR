To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` to make it case insensitive. The `table_exists` function should compare the lowercase versions of the table names to avoid failing the test due to case sensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function will compare the lowercase versions of the table names, making it case insensitive.

This fix addresses the GitHub issue raised, and it will ensure that the failing tests (`test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists`) will pass.

By making the function case insensitive, it aligns with the discussions and suggestions in the GitHub issues #896 and #895. The corrected version of the function will resolve the case sensitivity issue, leading to the passing of the failing tests.
