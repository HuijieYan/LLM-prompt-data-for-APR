The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the conditional logic in the function that directly returns the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In some cases, the function should return `True` or `False` based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`, but the current implementation does not handle these cases correctly.

The bug arises because the logic to determine if a table exists in the database does not account for different responses from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should return `True` if the table exists in the database and `False` otherwise, but the current implementation does not handle these cases correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic to properly determine if the table exists based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function handles the case when a partition is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions defined in the class
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
    
            return table in stdout.split('\n')  # Check if the table name is in the list of tables
        else:
            partition_clause = ' and '.join([f'{key}="{value}"' for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_clause})')
    
            return len(stdout.strip()) > 0  # Check if the partition exists
            
# The modified conditional logic first checks if a partition is provided. If not, it uses the provided table 
# and database to check if the table exists. If a partition is provided, it constructs the partition clause 
# and uses it to check for the existence of the partition.
```

With this corrected implementation, the `table_exists` function should now return `True` when the table or partition exists, and `False` otherwise, satisfying the expected input/output values for all the test cases provided.
