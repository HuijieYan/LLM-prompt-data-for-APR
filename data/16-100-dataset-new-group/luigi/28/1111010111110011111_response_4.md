The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly. The function should check if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner, as Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lowercase.

The bug occurs because the function performs a direct string comparison between the table name and the string returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function without taking into account the case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the returned string to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for the existence of the table. This change will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the bug.

With this correction, the function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it will resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
