The bug in the `table_exists` function from the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table, causing the test to fail in cases where the table name is provided in a different case.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the table existence case-insensitively by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test, and the GitHub issues related to the case insensitivity of the function have been resolved.
