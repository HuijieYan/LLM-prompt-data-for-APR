The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it does not correctly handle the case when `run_hive_cmd` returns a non-empty string.

The bug in the function `table_exists` is that it does not correctly check for the existence of the `table` or `partition` in the `stdout` variable. When `stdout` is not empty, the function expects a specific format for the output, but it does not handle non-empty outputs correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the existence of the `table` or `partition` in the `stdout` variable.

The corrected version of the function `table_exists` is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout
```

With the corrected function, it should now correctly handle non-empty `stdout` outputs and pass the failing test cases provided.
