The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a logic error that does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This bug causes the failing test cases, leading to inconsistent results when checking for the existence of tables with different cases (e.g., 'mytable' vs. 'MyTable').

The bug is caused by the function not accounting for case insensitivity when comparing the provided table name with the tables returned from the Hive query. As a result, the buggy function returns incorrect results, leading to failing test cases and inconsistent behavior.

One potential strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that both the provided table name and the tables returned from the Hive query are compared in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both names to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of table names is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the provided table name and the tables returned from the Hive query to lower case using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is consistent regardless of the case of the table names.

Applying this corrected version should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
