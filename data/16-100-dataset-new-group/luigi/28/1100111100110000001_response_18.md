The issue with the provided buggy function `table_exists` is that it is failing the test cases for the `table_exists` method. The failing test cases are due to the fact that the returned values are not being handled correctly in the `table_exists` method. The incorrect handling of the stdout is causing the tests to fail.

The primary problem in the `table_exists` method is the interpretation of the stdout variable when it comes to the `else` block. When the method checks for the `stdout` and return True or False, it is doing so in an unexpected way.

To resolve the issue, the functions `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` need to be handled properly within the `table_exists` method.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` method taking into account the required modifications:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partitions))
            return bool(stdout)

```

With these changes, the test cases for the `table_exists` method should pass without any issues.
