The cause of the bug is probably due to incorrect handling of the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` and the comparison with the table name in the `table_exists` function. When `stdout` is "OK", it's evaluated as False in the if statement, which should not be the case. The comparison should be made more robust and check for the presence of the table in the output.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to check more explicitly for the existence of the table name in the `stdout` and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
