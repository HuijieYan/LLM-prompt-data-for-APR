The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not properly check for the existence of a table in the specified database and partition. The function should return `True` if the table exists, and `False` otherwise, but it fails to do so in some cases.

The bug occurs due to the conditional checks. In the first case, the function only checks if the table name is in the output, and in the second case, it only checks if the output is not empty. This does not cover all the scenarios and can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we will modify the conditional checks to accurately determine the existence of the table in the specified database and partition.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the function checks whether the table name is exactly equal to the output in the first case (when partition is None), and in the second case, it directly returns the boolean value of the `stdout` variable, which is a more accurate representation of whether the table exists in the specified database and partition.
