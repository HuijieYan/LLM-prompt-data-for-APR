The issue with the buggy function is that the 'run_hive_cmd' and 'self.partition_spec' functions are not being called properly, leading to incorrect stdout values being returned.

The cause of the bug is that the 'run_hive_cmd' function is not being called with the correct parameters, and the 'self.partition_spec' function is being called incorrectly as well.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'run_hive_cmd' function is called with the correct parameters, and that the 'self.partition_spec' function is called appropriately.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ", ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the calls to the 'run_hive_cmd' function to ensure the correct parameters are passed. Additionally, we have updated the 'self.partition_spec' call within the 'table_exists' function to construct the 'partition_str' and pass it properly to the 'run_hive_cmd' function.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
