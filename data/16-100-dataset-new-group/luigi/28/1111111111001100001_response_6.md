The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be caused by the handling of the `stdout` variable and how it is checked in the return statements. It appears that the `stdout` variable is not being parsed correctly or the conditions for the return statements are incorrect, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `stdout` variable is being parsed correctly to check for the existence of the table or partition. Additionally, we need to fix the conditions in the return statements to accurately reflect the presence of the table or partition.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we have fixed the formatting of the `run_hive_cmd` function call to correctly include the database, table, and partition parameters. We use `bool(stdout)` to directly return the truthiness of the `stdout` variable, simplifying the return logic. This updated logic should address the issues identified during the analysis and enable the function to pass the failing tests.
