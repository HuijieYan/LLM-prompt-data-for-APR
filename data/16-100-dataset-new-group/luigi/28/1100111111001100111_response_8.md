The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not account for case insensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This results in the failing test cases where the table name's case does not match exactly with the case in the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before performing the comparison, making it case insensitive and resolving the issue raised on GitHub. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the reported bug.
