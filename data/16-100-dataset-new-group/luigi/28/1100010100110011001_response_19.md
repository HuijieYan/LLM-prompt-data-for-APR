To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the issue with the comparison of the `stdout` variable and the expected values. 

The bug occurs because the function checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty and then checks if the table is in the `stdout`, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to explicitly check for the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout is not None and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
