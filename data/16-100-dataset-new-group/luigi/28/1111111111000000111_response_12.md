The bug in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi.contrib.hive.py` is causing the test `test_table_exists` in the `hive_test.py` file to fail. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive and currently it is not.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not performing a case-insensitive check on the table name when comparing it with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to false negatives.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now perform a case-insensitive check on the table name and pass the failing test case. Also, this change aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue to check `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`.

This update will fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive as required in the GitHub issue.
