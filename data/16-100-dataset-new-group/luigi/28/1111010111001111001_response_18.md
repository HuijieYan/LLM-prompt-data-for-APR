The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is incorrectly checking the presence of the table in the `stdout` by using the `table in stdout` condition. This may lead to incorrect results as it does not explicitly check for an exact match.

In addition, the use of string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` call is incorrect and can cause issues with the query execution.

The function needs to be corrected to use the `stdout.strip()` method to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and then compare it with the table name. Also, the string formatting for the `run_hive_cmd` call needs to be fixed.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table == stdout.strip()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version will compare the exact table name with the output of the `show tables` query and return the correct boolean result. This should address the issues seen in the failing tests.
