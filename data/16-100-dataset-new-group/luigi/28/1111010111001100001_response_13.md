The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the incorrect logic for checking the presence of a table or partition in the Hive database. The current implementation also does not correctly handle the case insensitivity for table names.

To fix the bug, we should correct the usage of `run_hive_cmd` and properly handle the output to determine if the table or partition exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()  # case insensitive check
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # check if partition exists
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the result of `show tables` to lowercase before checking for presence. Additionally, when checking for the presence of a partition, we simply check if the `stdout` is not empty.
