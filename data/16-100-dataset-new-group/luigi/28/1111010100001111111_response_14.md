As per the analysis of the buggy function and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly. The issue mentioned that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, which are easier to read in code, but Hive returns them as lowercase, causing the tests to fail.

The bug is likely occurring due to a mismatch in case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is performed in a case-insensitive manner.

I suggest fixing the bug by comparing both the table name and the stdout in lowercase. This way, regardless of the case of the table name, it will be correctly compared with the stdout from Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle case-insensitive table existence checks as described in the GitHub issues.
