## Cause of the bug:

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `table_exists` function is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database, but the condition for checking the existence of the table is not implemented correctly.

The `stdout` obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being processed properly, which results in incorrect evaluation when checking for the existence of the table. This leads to the failing test cases where the expected result does not match the actual result.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The `table_exists` function needs to be modified to correctly parse the `stdout` obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. A conditional check should be made to determine the existence of the table based on the content of the `stdout`. The function should return `True` if the table exists and return `False` if the table does not exist.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # check if stdout is not empty
```

The corrected version of the function correctly handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and returns `True` if the table exists and `False` if the table does not exist.
