## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the updated file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
1. The cause of the bug was that the function didn't account for case insensitivity when checking for table existence, leading to failing test cases.
2. The stdout was not being checked for case insensitivity, leading to the incorrect comparison of table names.
3. The failing test showed that "FooBar" was being compared to "foobar" causing the test to fail.
4. The bug can be fixed by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function includes using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` to compare case insensitively. This ensures that the function returns the correct result regardless of the case of the table name or the stdout.
