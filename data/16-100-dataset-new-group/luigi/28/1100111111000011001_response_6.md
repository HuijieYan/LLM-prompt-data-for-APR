The bug in the `table_exists` function is most likely in the conditional statement where the `stdout` variable is being checked. The function currently returns `True` if `stdout` is not an empty string, and `False` if it is an empty string.

The issue lies in the fact that the function is not handling the case where the table name is contained within other words in the `stdout` variable. For example, if `stdout` were to contain "NotOKmytable", the function would incorrectly return `True` because it only checks if the `table` is in `stdout`.

To fix the bug, a better approach would be to split the `stdout` by newline character and to check if the `table` is in the resulting list. This would accurately determine if the `table` exists in the `stdout` regardless of its position within the string.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return any(table == line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function should now return the expected results for all the provided test cases.
