The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case-insensitive. The function checks if the table exists based on the exact case of the table name, which causes the tests to fail when the case is different.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this change, the function will perform a case-insensitive check for the table name in the `stdout`, resolving the failing tests and addressing the GitHub issue.
