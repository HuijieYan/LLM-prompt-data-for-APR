The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case insensitivity when checking table existence in the Hive database. This is related to GitHub issue #896, where the function should be case insensitive.

The bug is located within the `table_exists` function, specifically in the comparison of the table name in the stdout.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the table name in the stdout should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Additionally, the run_hive_cmd function needs to be mocked to return the expected outputs for the test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With the updated `table_exists` function, it should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
