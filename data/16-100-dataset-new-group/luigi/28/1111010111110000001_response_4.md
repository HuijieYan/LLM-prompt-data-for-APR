The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is located in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. This function is meant to check whether a specified table exists in the Hive database and return a boolean value accordingly.

The function checks if a `partition` is provided and then executes a command based on that condition. If there is no partition, it runs a command to show tables, and if there is a partition, it runs a command to show partitions.

The issue with the function is that the conditional statements are incorrectly checking the content of the `stdout` variable and returning the opposite boolean value, leading to inconsistent results.

The failing test is attempting to verify the behavior of the `table_exists` function with different input scenarios, but the function is returning incorrect values in some cases, leading to assertions errors.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `table_exists` function should be modified to return the correct boolean values based on the content of the `stdout` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return len(stdout.strip()) > 0
```

The corrected version addresses the issues with conditional statements by properly checking the content of the `stdout` variable and returning the correct boolean values. This should resolve the failing test cases and ensure that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected.
