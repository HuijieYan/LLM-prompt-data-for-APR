The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it does not handle case insensitivity. This causes the tests to fail when checking for table existence using different cases for the table name. The GitHub issue related to this bug has been identified, and the issue is related to case insensitivity in the `table_exists` function.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to make it case insensitive. Adjust the comparison of the table name in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function handles case insensitivity by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This change will make the function pass the failing tests and address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
