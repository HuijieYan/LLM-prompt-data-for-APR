The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the fact that when a table is checked for existence, the function does not ignore the case of the table name. This causes a discrepancy between the expected and actual output when comparing strings.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
