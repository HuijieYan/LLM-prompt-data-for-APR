The main issue with the buggy function `table_exists` is that it does not handle case insensitivity. As mentioned in the GitHub issue, sometimes the tables are defined as capitalized, while Hive is case insensitive and returns them as lower case. This is causing the test cases to fail due to case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` needs to handle the case insensitivity by comparing the table name with the lower case version of the output from Hive. We need to modify the comparison to account for case insensitivity to solve the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function compares the lower case version of the table name with the lower case version of the Hive output using the `lower()` function. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and would resolve the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.

This fix aligns with the GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive," where it was suggested to check stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues.

With the corrected function, it should pass the failing test cases and handle case insensitivity as expected.
