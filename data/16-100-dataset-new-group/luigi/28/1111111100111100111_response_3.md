The issue is caused by the fact that the `table_exists` function is case sensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the run_hive_cmd function.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison of the table name with the stdout to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` values are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, making the comparison case insensitive. This change ensures that the function will return the correct result without being affected by the case of the table name.
