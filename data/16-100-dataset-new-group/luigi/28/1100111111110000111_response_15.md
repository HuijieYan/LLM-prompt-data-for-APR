To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make sure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the hive command is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive.

This correction resolves the issue reported in GitHub and ensures that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected, passing the failing test cases without any assertion errors.
