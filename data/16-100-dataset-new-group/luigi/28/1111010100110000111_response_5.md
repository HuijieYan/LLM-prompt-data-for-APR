We can see that the problem is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table using the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The error message from the failing test indicates that the check is failing when the table name is provided in a different case than what is returned from the command.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive. The proposed fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive way.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now be case insensitive and pass the failing test, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
