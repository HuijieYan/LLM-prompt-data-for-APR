The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The problem arises from the logic within the function that processes the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The error message reveals that the function is returning incorrect results.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect parsing of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Inconsistent logic for handling the partition and non-partition cases.

The cause of the bug is that the existing implementation of the function does not properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This leads to incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists or not.

A strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the function to properly parse and evaluate the output from the `run_hive_cmd`, and ensure that the logic for handling partition and non-partition cases is consistent and accurate.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    stdout = ""
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    if stdout:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

In this corrected version, the output from `run_hive_cmd` is properly stored in the `stdout` variable. Then, the function directly evaluates the output, returning `True` if the output is non-empty, and `False` if it is empty.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
