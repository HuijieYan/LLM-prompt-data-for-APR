Based on the failing test cases and the provided GitHub issue, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity. The `table_exists` function should be case insensitive when checking if a table exists in the Hive database.

The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to failed test cases. In some cases, the table name in the database is returned in lowercase, causing the function to incorrectly determine whether the table exists or not based on case matching.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should check the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase, the corrected function will be able to properly handle case sensitivity and pass the failing test cases.

Additionally, the fix addresses the GitHub issue by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive as suggested.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function should now handle case sensitivity properly and pass the failing test cases.
