Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class seems to be related to case sensitivity in table existence checks. The GitHub issue mentions that the table names are sometimes defined as capitalized, but Hive returns them as lowercase, leading to failures in the tests. The suggestion to fix this issue is to modify the function to check `table.lower()` against `stdout.lower()` to avoid case sensitivity problems. 

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected function ensures that both the table name and the stdout are compared in a case-insensitive manner (`table.lower() in stdout.lower()`). This satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
