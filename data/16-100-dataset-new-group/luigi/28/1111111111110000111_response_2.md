The buggy function `table_exists` fails the test case because it is not handling the table name in a case-insensitive manner, causing the assertion to fail.

The root cause of the bug is the buggy function's failure to handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The failing test is a result of the buggy function returning `False` when it should return `True` in the case-insensitive comparison.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the `table` and `stdout` strings to lowercase before performing the comparison.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will convert the table and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing, making the comparison case-insensitive and resolving the bug.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
