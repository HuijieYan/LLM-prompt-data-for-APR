The bug in the provided `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class is related to case sensitivity. This is clear from the GitHub issue, which also suggests a fix by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `table` variable needs to be converted to lowercase when being compared to the `stdout` variable. This will resolve the case sensitivity issue and ensure that the comparison is not affected by differences in case.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `table` and `stdout` values are compared after converting both to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
