The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` may not work as intended.
2. The use of string formatting and substitution may not be done correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `stdout and table in stdout` may not accurately check if the table exists, and the string formatting/substitution may lead to errors in the query.

To fix the bug, the function can be modified to explicitly check if the table exists in the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, the string formatting/substitution can be done using the `format` method for better readability and to avoid potential errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {}; show tables like "{}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {}; show partitions {} partition {};'.format(database, table, partition_spec))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the function explicitly checks if the table exists in the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The string formatting using the `format` method has been updated for better readability and to avoid potential errors.
