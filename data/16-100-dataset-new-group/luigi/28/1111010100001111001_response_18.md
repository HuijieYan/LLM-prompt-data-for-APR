The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the condition checks and the comparison of the expected output. The condition checks and response to these checks are not properly handled. The function is expected to return `True` if the table exists, and `False` if it does not. However, the function returns `stdout and table in stdout`, which is not always a valid response and can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to properly check for the existence of the table and then return `True` or `False` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
