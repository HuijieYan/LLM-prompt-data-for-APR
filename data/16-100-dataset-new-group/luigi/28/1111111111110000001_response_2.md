Based on the given buggy function and the test cases, it seems that the issue is with the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in the specified database and partition, if provided. However, the logic for checking the presence of a table in the given database is flawed. Additionally, the test cases for the `table_exists` function indicate that it returns incorrect results for certain inputs.

The code of the buggy function has two main issues:
1. The condition for checking the existence of a table is not handled properly. It directly returns the result of the comparison between `stdout` and `table`, which is incorrect.
2. When a partition is specified, the function incorrectly calls `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec(partition)` without handling the partition logic correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the checks for table existence and partition specifications.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = " and ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})""".format(database, table, partition_query))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function handles the table existence check correctly for both the cases when a partition is specified and when it is not. It uses a query to check for the existence of the table and handles the partition logic correctly.

Once the corrected version of the `table_exists` function is used, it should pass the failing test cases.
