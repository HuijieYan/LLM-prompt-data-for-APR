First, let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the related functions, test code, error message, and the GitHub issues. The function `table_exists` is a method of the class `HiveCommandClient` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function with different parameters based on the value of the `partition` argument.

The failing test checks the behavior of the `table_exists` method under different conditions (table exists, table does not exist, case insensitivity, partition exists, and partition does not exist).

The error message from the failing test indicates that the test for case insensitivity fails. The first GitHub issue discusses the need to make the `table_exists` method case insensitive. The second GitHub issue is titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" and suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

It seems that the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in Hive, and the fix involves making the comparison case insensitive.

Now, based on the analysis, let's identify potential error locations within the buggy function. The issue is likely with the comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison made in the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing the test for case insensitivity to fail. The fix involves making the comparison case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, making the comparison case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue.

This correction should address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
