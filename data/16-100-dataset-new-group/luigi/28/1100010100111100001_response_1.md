The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `table` parameter with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Based on the failing tests and the provided runtime values, it appears that the function is not correctly checking for the existence of the table in some cases.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function correctly handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and compares it with the `table` parameter in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` is performed in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase before comparison. This should address the failing tests and ensure that the function works as expected in all scenarios.
