The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when comparing the table names. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names have different cases than expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the values returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the values returned by `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.

After making this change, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
