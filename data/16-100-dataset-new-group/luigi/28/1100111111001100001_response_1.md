The issue with the buggy function is in the conditional statement that checks if the `stdout` variable contains a specific string. The bug is causing the function to return the wrong values for the test cases.

In Case 1, the function should return `True` because the table exists, but it returns `False` because the `stdout` value is not being properly checked.

In Case 2, the function should return `True` because the table exists, but it returns `False` due to the same issue with checking the `stdout` value.

In Case 3, since the partition is not None, the function should return `True` because the partition exists, but it may not return the correct value due to the bug in the conditional statement.

The correct strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditional statement to properly check the `stdout` variable for the existence of the table or partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout.strip())  # Check if the stdout is not empty and return the result
```

By using `bool(stdout.strip())`, we are effectively checking if the `stdout` is not empty, which is more reliable than just checking if `stdout` is `True` or `False`. This should fix the bug and the function should now return the correct values for the failing test cases.
