The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not correctly handle the case when a table exists in the Hive database. This results in the failing test cases. The issue seems to be related to how the function is checking the presence of a table in the database and how it handles the partition parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not correctly parsing the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function, and it is not handling the partition parameter properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly check for table existence and handle the partition parameter as well.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle both regular table existence checks and partitioned table existence checks. This should resolve the failing test cases.
