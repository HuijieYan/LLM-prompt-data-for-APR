The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly. The `run_hive_cmd` function is expected to return a string, and the `table_exists` function should check if the table exists in the output string.

The issue is that the current implementation of the function only checks if the `stdout` variable exists, and not if the table is present in it.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` conditions to properly check if the table exists in the `stdout` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout != '' and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout != ''
```

In this corrected version, we use the `!=` operator to check if `stdout` is not an empty string, and then we check if the table exists in the output for the first case. For the second case, we simply return the result of the check for an empty string.

With this corrected version, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values stated.
