The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test to return an unexpected assertion error due to case sensitivity issues.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. This leads to inconsistencies when comparing table names with different cases.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive when comparing table names with the `stdout` from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the conditional statement to check for `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the function now compares table names in a case-insensitive manner, matching the behavior expected in the failing test and addressing the issue reported on GitHub. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
