The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check whether a table exists in a given database and partition, if provided. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions to execute Hive commands and get the partition specifications.

There are a few potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function may not be returning the expected values.
2. The `partition_spec` function may not be providing correct partition specifications.
3. The conditionals used to check the output of the `run_hive_cmd` functions could be incorrect.

Based on the failing test cases, the bugs in the function are as follows:
1. In the first case, when there is no partition, the function should return False if `stdout` is 'OK', but it is currently returning True.
2. In the second case, when there is no partition and the table exists, the function should return True if table is in `stdout`, but it is currently returning False.

To fix the bugs, we should first ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is returning the expected values, and then correct the conditionals used to check the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return 'OK' in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{0}={1}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition({partition_str})")
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the corrected version, for the case where there is no partition, we check if `'OK'` is in `stdout` and for the case with a partition, we use the specified partition to check if any partitions are returned in `stdout`. This corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
