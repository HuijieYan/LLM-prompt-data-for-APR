The bug in the provided function is that the conditional statement for checking the existence of the table does not evaluate the condition correctly. The function is returning the result of the condition `stdout and table in stdout` for the first case instead of returning `True` or `False` based on whether the table exists. Similarly, for the case where partition is not None, the function is not properly checking for the existence of the table in the stdout.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly check whether the table exists in the stdout and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the bug-fixed file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the function will return `True` if the table exists, and `False` if it does not, satisfying all the expected input/output values for the provided cases.
