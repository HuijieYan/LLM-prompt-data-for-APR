Based on the analysis and given GitHub issues, it seems that the bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does not handle case-insensitivity correctly. The bug occurs when the `table` parameter is capitalized, but the `stdout` result is returned in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare `table.lower()` with `stdout.lower()` to handle case-insensitivity properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function now compares the lowercase versions of `table` and `stdout`, allowing for case-insensitive comparison. This should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
