To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` case insensitive. This will ensure that the function returns the correct result regardless of the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the table_exists function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase, and then perform the comparison to make it case insensitive. This ensures that the function returns the correct result regardless of the case of the table name.

This fix addresses the GitHub issue by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive, as suggested in the issue discussions.
