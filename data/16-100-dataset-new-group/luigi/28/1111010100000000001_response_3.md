Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Incorrect formatting of the SQL query strings.
2. Inconsistent return statement usage.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect formatting of the SQL query strings and inconsistent usage of return statements. This can lead to incorrect results when checking for table existence or partition existence in the Hive database.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Fix the formatting of the SQL query strings to ensure they are properly constructed.
2. Use consistent and clear return statements to improve readability and accuracy of the function.

Explanation of the corrected version:
The corrected version of the function addresses the issues by fixing the formatting of the SQL query strings and using consistent return statements. This ensures that the function will correctly check for the existence of a table or partition in the Hive database.
