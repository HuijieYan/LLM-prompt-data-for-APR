The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the fact that the function compares the table name with the output from Hive without considering the case sensitivity. This causes the function to return incorrect results when checking if a table exists in the database. The GitHub issue suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to check if the lowercase version of the table name is present in the lowercase version of the `stdout` from Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub thread by checking the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the `stdout` output from Hive, making the comparison case insensitive.
