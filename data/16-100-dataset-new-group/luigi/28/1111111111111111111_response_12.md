The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not performing a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists in the given database. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name casing does not match the casing of the database. 

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. We can use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the database output to lowercase for comparison, ensuring that the casing doesn't affect the result.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive comparison, and is expected to pass the failing test cases.

Additionally, this fix addresses GitHub issues #896 and #1042 by making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, resolving the case-related inconsistencies.
