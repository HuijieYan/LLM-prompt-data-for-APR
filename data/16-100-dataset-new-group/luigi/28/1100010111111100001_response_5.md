The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the condition checking for the existence of a table when a partition is provided. The logic inside the `if` and `else` branches is inconsistent and likely causing the test failures.

It appears that the function is not handling the table name case-insensitively, leading to incorrect test results.

A potential strategy to fix the bug is to modify the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` to be case-insensitive. Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of a partition also needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split()
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)

    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version handles case-insensitive table name comparisons and fixes the logic for checking the existence of a partition. With these changes, the function should pass the failing tests.
