The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way it handles the `stdout` returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function in the case when a table exists. The function is checking if the table name is in the `stdout`, but it is not handling the case where the table name appears as a substring in a larger string.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check if the table name is a separate word in the `stdout` string. We can accomplish this by using regular expressions to match the table name as a whole word.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
import re  # Add this import at the top of the file

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions and class members)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and any(match.group(0) == table for match in re.finditer(r'\b{0}\b'.format(table), stdout))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # can be simplified, as the condition is already a boolean
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle both cases where the table name appears in the `stdout` string or when it doesn't, passing all the failing tests.
