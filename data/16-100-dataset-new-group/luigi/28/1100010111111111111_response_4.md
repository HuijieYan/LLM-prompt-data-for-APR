The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case insensitivity for table names. The function is not lowering the table name and comparing them, which causes the failing test cases.

The solution is to modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

With these changes, the function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it will resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
