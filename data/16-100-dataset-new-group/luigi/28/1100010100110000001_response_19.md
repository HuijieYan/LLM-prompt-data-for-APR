The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be that the condition for checking the existence of a table is incorrect, leading to failing tests and unexpected assertion errors.

The cause of the bug is that the function returns `False` if the `stdout` is empty, instead of checking directly whether `table` is in `stdout` or not. This issue results in the `assertFalse` assertion failing, leading to an AssertionError when trying to test the condition.

To fix the bug, the condition should be changed so that it directly checks if the `table` is in `stdout`. This will ensure that the correct response is returned based on the table's existence in the specified database.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, if the `partition` is not None, it directly checks if `stdout` is not empty and returns the corresponding boolean value. This change will ensure that the function behaves as intended and passes the failing tests.
