The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by a case sensitivity issue where the function does not handle cases where the table names are in different cases. The expected behavior is that the function should be case insensitive when checking for the table's existence.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will now handle the case insensitivity issue and pass the failing test cases. This correction also satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
