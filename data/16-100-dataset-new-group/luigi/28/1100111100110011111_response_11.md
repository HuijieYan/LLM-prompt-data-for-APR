To resolve the bug, we need to fix the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive by checking stdout against the lowercase of the table name. This will address the issue posted on GitHub regarding case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # . . . (other functions remain unchanged)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected function uses the `lower()` method to make both the table name and the stdout lowercase, allowing for a case-insensitive comparison. This approach aligns with the suggestions made in the GitHub issue.

With this change, the `table_exists` function will now handle case sensitivity properly, ensuring that the test cases pass and the expected input/output values are satisfied.
