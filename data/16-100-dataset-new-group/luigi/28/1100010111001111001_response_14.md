Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to incorrect logic handling in the `else` statement of the function. When a partition is provided, the function should check if the partition exists in the table, but the current implementation is not doing that correctly.

To fix the bug, the `else` statement should be modified to correctly check if the specified partition exists in the table. Additionally, in the first conditional statement, the function should return `stdout` directly instead of checking `stdout` and table presence separately.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
