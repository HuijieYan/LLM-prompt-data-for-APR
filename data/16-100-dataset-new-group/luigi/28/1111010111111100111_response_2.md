To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The current implementation is case sensitive, which causes the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the updated function:
- We use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive.
- The return value when partition is not None is simplified using the `bool()` function to directly return the truthiness of `stdout`.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
