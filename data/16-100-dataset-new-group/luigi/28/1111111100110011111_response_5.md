The bug is due to the case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function. The function is comparing the table name without considering case, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding the case sensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
