The bug in the `table_exists` function is being reported in GitHub issue #896. The problem here is that the function is case sensitive, causing the test for table existence to fail in certain cases when the table name is in different cases (e.g., capitalized or lowercase). The root cause of the bug can be identified from the failing test where the `table_exists` function returns False instead of True.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. We will convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison. Additionally, the function should check for the presence of the lowercase table name in the lowercase output of the hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition).lower()))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function will compare table names and hive command outputs in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the bug.

By using this updated `table_exists` function, both of the failing tests provided in the GitHub issue description should pass.
