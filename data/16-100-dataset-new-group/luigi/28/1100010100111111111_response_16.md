The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. The issue has been reported on GitHub and it is recommended to check `stdout` against the lowercase version of the table name to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to convert `stdout` and the table name to lowercase before comparison. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version will compare `stdout` and the table name in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.
