Based on the given information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by case sensitivity in the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. This discrepancy causes the test cases that check for table existence to fail.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This correction will ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case insensitive, allowing the test cases to pass and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
