The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not check for the table's existence in a case-insensitive manner, leading to failures when tables are defined with capitalized names. The function needs to be fixed to make the comparison case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made in the `table_exists` function:
1. Convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive command.
2. Make the comparison case insensitive to ensure that the function handles tables with different cases correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function now correctly handles case-insensitive comparisons and should pass all the expected test cases. This also addresses the GitHub issues related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
