The buggy function `table_exists` has a logical error in the `if partition is None` block. The `run_hive_cmd` function is expected to return the output of the command run, and the logic is to check if the table exists in the output. However, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` does not explicitly check if the `table` exists in the `stdout`, which leads to incorrect results.

In the `else` block, there appears to be no issue with the logic. However, it is missing the check if the `table` exists in the `stdout`.

To fix the logical error, the condition in the `if partition is None` block needs to explicitly check if the `table` exists in the `stdout`. Additionally, the condition in the `else` block also needs to check if the `table` exists in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
```

This corrected version explicitly checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` for both conditions, and it should now satisfy all the expected cases provided.
