To fix the bug, we need to modify the buggy function `table_exists` to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the table names returned from hive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Explanation:
1. The bug in the original code was that it didn't handle case sensitivity when comparing the table names returned from hive with the input table name. This caused the test to fail when the cases didn't match.

2. To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function uses the `lower()` method to convert both the input table name and the table names returned from hive to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive.

3. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.

With this fix, the function will now be case insensitive when checking if a table exists in Hive, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
