Potential Error Locations:
- The if condition with `return stdout and table in stdout` might cause the issue due to case sensitivity.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the case sensitivity of the table name when checking for its existence in the stdout. The function currently only checks for an exact match, which leads to failing tests if the table name's case is different. The issue on GitHub confirms that the table_exists function should be case insensitive because Hive is case insensitive. 

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This change ensures that case sensitivity is handled, and the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
