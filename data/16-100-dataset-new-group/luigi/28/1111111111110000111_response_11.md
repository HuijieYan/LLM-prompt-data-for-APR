Since the issue identified is related to case sensitivity, we can fix the bug by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive when comparing table names.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function should be as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version compares the table name and the stdout as lowercase to make the comparison case insensitive.

This will resolve the issue raised in GitHub and the failing test cases provided.
