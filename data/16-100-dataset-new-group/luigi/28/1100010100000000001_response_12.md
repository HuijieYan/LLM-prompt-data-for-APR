def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            {2};""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if "No partition" not in stdout:

## Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function "table_exists" is designed to check if a table or partition exists in the Hive database. However, there are several issues in the original code.

The potential error locations in the original code include:
1. The "show tables" command should use "in" instead of "like" to properly search for a table in a specific database.
2. The "show partitions" command should not have "partition" as a literal string and should utilize the correct Python string formatting for the database, table, and partition.

The cause of the bug in the original code is:
1. The "show tables" command is not correctly querying the specified database for the table existence check.
2. The "show partitions" command is not correctly querying the partition existence check and has a formatting issue.

The strategy for fixing the bug includes:
1. Modify the "show tables" command to use "in" for searching in a specific database.
2. Correct the formatting and usage of the "show partitions" command.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and provides the necessary fixes to properly check for table and partition existence in the Hive database.
