The bug in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class is due to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. This issue is captured in GitHub issues #896 and mentioned in the failing test function `test_table_exists`.

The potential error location in the buggy function is when checking for table existence, especially when comparing the table name in the stdout.

The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` method is that it does not account for case insensitivity when comparing the table name in the stdout, which causes the failing test as it returns False instead of True.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing. This is suggested in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive using `lower()` on both the table name and the stdout, we resolve the bug and ensure that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected, passing the failing test and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
