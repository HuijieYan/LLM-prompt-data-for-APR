The bug is located in the `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The bug causes the function to be case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database, leading to failing test cases due to case mismatch in table names.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function compares the table name directly with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which doesn't handle case insensitivity. This leads to failing tests when the table name case doesn't match the case of the table name retrieved from Hive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase or uppercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and fix the failing test cases.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and addresses the failing test cases.
