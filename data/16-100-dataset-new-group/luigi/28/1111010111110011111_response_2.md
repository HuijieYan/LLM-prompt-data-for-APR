To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This will address the issue raised in GitHub related to the function failing when checking for tables with capital letters. 

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison, making it case insensitive and addressing the issue raised in the GitHub discussion. This correction will allow the function to pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
