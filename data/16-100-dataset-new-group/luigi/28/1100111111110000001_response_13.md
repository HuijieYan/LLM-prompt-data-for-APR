The buggy function is the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi.contrib.hive`, and it is being called in the `HiveCommandClientTest` class in the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` methods, which are part of `test/contrib/hive_test.py`.

The bug is caused by the fact that when the `table_exists` method has to check if a table exists in Hive without a partition, it returns the opposite of what it should (`False` when it should be `True` and vice versa). This is because the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect.

Similarly, when the `table_exists` method has to check if a table exists in Hive with a partition, it also returns the opposite of what it should. The condition `if stdout` is supposed to indicate that the table exists, but it is returning `True` for an empty string, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, modify the `table_exists` method to correct the conditions and return the correct boolean values.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout is not None and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout is not None and stdout != ""
```

With this corrected version of the `table_exists` method, it should now pass the failing test cases.
