### The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the lack of case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function does not account for the case sensitivity of table names in Hive, leading to failing tests when checking for table existence.

### A strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to make it case insensitive when checking the table existence. This can be done by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the check.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version makes use of `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` to ensure case insensitivity when checking for table existence. This version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
