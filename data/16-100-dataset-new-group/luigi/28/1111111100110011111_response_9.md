The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue on GitHub (#896) suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the stdout against the lowercased table name.

The buggy function fails to account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. In the failing test, it returns `False` instead of `True` when the table name exists and is not in lowercase format.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command in both cases where `partition` is `None` and `partition` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now be case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue. It will compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command, ensuring that the function works as expected and passes the failing test cases.
