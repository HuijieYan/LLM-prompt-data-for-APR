## Corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}"'.format(database, database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the original function arises from incorrect SQL commands being constructed when showing tables and partitions. It also doesn't handle the case of an empty `stdout` which can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the SQL commands being constructed for showing tables and partitions.
2. Handle the condition of an empty `stdout` to ensure the function returns the correct boolean value.

I corrected the function by adjusting the construction of the SQL commands and added a check for an empty `stdout` in the return statements.
