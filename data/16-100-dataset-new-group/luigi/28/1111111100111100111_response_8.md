The bug in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is causing the failing tests due to case sensitivity issues. The function is not handling case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The failing test cases 1, 2, 4, and 5 are due to the function's case sensitivity.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the output received from the Hive command. This will ensure case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... Other class functions ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the command output are converted to lowercase for case insensitive comparison. This approach aligns with the suggested fix in GitHub issue #896.

The corrected function should now pass all the previously failing test cases and resolve the issue of case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
