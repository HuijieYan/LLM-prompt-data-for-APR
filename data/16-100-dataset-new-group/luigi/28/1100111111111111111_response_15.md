            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:

```
After analyzing the provided information, it is clear that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity issues when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. To fix this bug, the corrected version of the function includes converting the table and stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, the function will become case insensitive and accurately determine the existence of the specified table in the Hive database.

Additionally, the corrected function will satisfy all the failing test cases and the expected input/output values. It will also address the GitHub issues related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
