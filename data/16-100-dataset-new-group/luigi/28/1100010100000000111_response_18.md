The buggy function `table_exists` in the "luigi/contrib/hive.py" file has a bug that causes it to be case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This bug is related to the GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?"

The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison of the table name and stdout, which is case sensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes issues when the table names are defined with different cases than what is returned by the Hive database.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to modify the comparison to make it case-insensitive by converting both the table name and stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

In this corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method, and then a case-insensitive comparison is made to check for the existence of the table. This will resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database.
