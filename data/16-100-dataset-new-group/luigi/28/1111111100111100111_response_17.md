Based on the error message from the failing tests and the bug report on GitHub, it seems that the `table_exists` function is case sensitive. This means that when checking for the existence of a table, it is not taking case into consideration. The function should be case insensitive when comparing the table names.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, the table name and the `stdout` output are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.
