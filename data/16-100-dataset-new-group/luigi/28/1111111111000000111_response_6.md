The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is related to case sensitivity. The function fails tests that check for table existence with different case variations, where tables are defined as capitalized, and Hive returns them as lower case.

The potential error in the buggy function is in the comparison of the `table` and `stdout`, where the comparison should be made case-insensitive.

The bug cause is that the function compares the `table` directly with `stdout`, which causes the test to fail when table names have different case variations.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_cmd})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, `table` and `stdout` are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method for a case-insensitive comparison.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
