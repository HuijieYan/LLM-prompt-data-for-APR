The bug in the `table_exists` function causes it to be case-sensitive, resulting in failed tests when checking for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison, thereby making it case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will now convert the table name to lowercase and compare it with the lowercase version of the stdout, making the comparison case-insensitive. This change aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue #896.

By using this corrected version of the function, the failing tests related to case sensitivity should pass, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
