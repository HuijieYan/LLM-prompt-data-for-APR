This `table_exists` function has a bug where it checks for table existence in a case-sensitive manner, causing tests to fail due to case mismatches. The issue on GitHub (#896) indicates that this function should be made case insensitive. 

The bug is causing the tests to fail because the function does not account for case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The expected table names are not matching the actual names retrieved from the database, leading to assertion errors in the tests.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to account for case insensitivity. By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase, we can ensure that the comparison is not case sensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function now converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them, making the check for table existence case insensitive. This should resolve the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub (#896).
