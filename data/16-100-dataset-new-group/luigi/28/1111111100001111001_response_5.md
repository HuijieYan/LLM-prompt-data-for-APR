## The cause of the bug
The bug seems to be in the function `table_exists`. In the first case, the `table_exists` function is checking if a table exists in a given database. If the `partition` is `None`, it runs a hive command to check if the table exists. If the `partition` is not `None`, it runs a different hive command. However, the second hive command for the partition check uses `self.partition_spec(partition)` as part of the command, but it should instead use the `partition` dictionary directly.

## Potential locations of the bug
The bug seems to be in the `table_exists` function when creating the hive command for the partition check.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the code that constructs the hive command for the partition check. Instead of using `self.partition_spec(partition)` which is a call to a function, it should directly use the `partition` information to construct the command.

## The corrected version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition
                            ({3})""".format(database, database, table, partition_str))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
