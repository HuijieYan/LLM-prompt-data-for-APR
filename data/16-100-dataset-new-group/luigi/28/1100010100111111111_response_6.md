The bug causes the `table_exists` function to return incorrect values due to the incorrect comparison between the `table` parameter and the `stdout` variable. This results in the failing tests where the expected and actual values do not match, leading to the assertion errors.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout. This ensures that the function correctly identifies whether the table exists in the database, regardless of the case of the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, modifications have been made to perform case-insensitive comparisons using the `lower()` method on both the `table` and `stdout`. This ensures that the comparison is not affected by the case of the table names, resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.
