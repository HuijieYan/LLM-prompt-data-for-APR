## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class:
The buggy function `table_exists` is a method of the class `HiveCommandClient` which is a subclass of `HiveClient`. It is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is used without being properly defined or imported, which will cause an error.
2. There is an issue with the string formatting in the first part of the function.
3. The `partition_spec` method is called without being defined or imported.

## Explaining the cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the missing definition or import of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `partition_spec` method. Additionally, there is an issue with the string formatting in the first part of the function.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Define or import the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `partition_spec` method.
2. Use the correct string formatting to ensure the queries are constructed properly.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # The corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
