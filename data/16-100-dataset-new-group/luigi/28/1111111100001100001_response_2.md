The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to the `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` function calls. It seems that the condition to check for the existence of a table in the database is incorrect.

The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with the SQL command to use the database and show tables like the given table name. If stdout is not empty and the table name is in the output, the function returns True, otherwise False. This logic seems correct.

For partitions, the `run_hive_cmd` is called with a SQL command to use the database, show partitions for the table, and partition specifications. If stdout is not empty, it returns True, otherwise False. Here, it should not check for the existence of the partition, but rather return whether the partition specification is correct.

The bug may be in the way the `self.partition_spec` function is generating the partition specification. It seems to be incorrect as it is not just returning the partition specification but also mixing it with the SQL command.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to correctly handle partitions and incorporate the correct logic for checking for the existence of partitions.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Check for the existence of the partition specification
        partition_exists = self.partition_spec(partition) in run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s""" % (database, table))
        return partition_exists
```

In this corrected version, for the case where a partition is specified, the `run_hive_cmd` now checks for the existence of the partition specification obtained from `self.partition_spec` and returns the result.
