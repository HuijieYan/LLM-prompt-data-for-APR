The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This leads to failing test cases when the table name is provided in a different case than what's returned in the `stdout`.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function will correctly handle case insensitive table name comparisons and will pass the failing test cases. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub issue #896.
