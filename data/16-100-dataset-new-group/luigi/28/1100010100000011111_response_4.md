The buggy function has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for an existing table in Hive. The current implementation doesn't account for the case-insensitivity of Hive and may result in false negatives when checking for table existence. The bug causes the test to fail when the table is defined with different cases (e.g., capitalized vs. lowercase).

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison to ensure case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version will convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison to make the existence check case-insensitive. This aligns with the fix suggested in the GitHub issue.
