Buggy code has multiple issues:

1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called as if it were a class method, but it's actually a standalone function.
2. There are multiple `partition_spec` functions defined in the same file, but not as class methods. This could lead to ambiguity in function calls.
3. The `table_exists` function has a condition that checks if `stdout` is not empty, but the return value of `run_hive_cmd` may not always be what is expected.

To fix these issues:
1. Call the `run_hive_cmd` function as a standalone function, passing in the `hivecmd` as an argument.
2. Remove the extra `partition_spec` functions that are not part of the class.
3. Modify the conditions to properly handle the return value of `run_hive_cmd`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_string = ' AND '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_string))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
