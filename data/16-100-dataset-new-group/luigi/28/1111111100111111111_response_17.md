The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is performing a case-sensitive check for the existence of a table in the `stdout` returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. This leads to failing test cases when checking the existence of tables with different cases.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should check for the lowercase version of the table name in the `stdout` to make the existence check case-insensitive. This will resolve the failing test cases and also address the GitHub issues related to case-insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the failing test cases and addressing the GitHub issues.
