## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database. It has a conditional statement to handle the case of whether a partition is specified or not. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and retrieve the output.

## Potential error locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function could be the conditional statement and the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being used to retrieve the output and determine the existence of the table.

## Cause of the bug
The bug in the function is likely related to how it handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It appears that in the conditional statement, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` may not correctly evaluate whether the table exists. Similarly, the second conditional statement also may not handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` properly to determine the existence of the table.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function can be modified to properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function for both cases of checking table existence with and without partitions. Additionally, the conditions for evaluating the output need to be checked to ensure they are correctly determining the table's existence.

## Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)  # using bool() to check if stdout has a value
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # using bool() to check if stdout has a value
```

In the corrected version, the function uses `bool()` to check if the `stdout` variable has a value or not, thus properly determining the existence of the table.
