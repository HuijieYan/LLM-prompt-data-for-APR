The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. However, the failing test cases reveal that the function is case-sensitive when comparing the table name with the output from Hive, resulting in incorrect return values.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists, which is not desirable as Hive is case insensitive. This issue has been noted in the GitHub issues #896 and #1037.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the comparison to use the lowercase versions of the table name and the Hive output, the corrected function now performs a case-insensitive check for table existence. This approach aligns with the expectation documented in the GitHub issues.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
