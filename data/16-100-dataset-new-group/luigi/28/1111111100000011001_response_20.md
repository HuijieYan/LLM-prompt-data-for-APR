The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without the correct parameters and the `partition_spec` function is being called incorrectly. Another issue is that the conditional statement is not handling the returned value of `run_hive_cmd` correctly. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct parameters and handle its return value properly. Additionally, the `partition_spec` function is also being misused and needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return bool(stdout.strip())  # check if stdout is not empty
    
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        query = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
        
        return bool(stdout.strip())  # check if stdout is not empty
```

In this corrected version:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct parameters in both the branches of the `if-else` statement.
2. The return value of `run_hive_cmd` is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and then converted to a boolean value to check if it's empty or not.
3. The `partition_spec` function is not needed and has been removed from the function.

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values provided. It properly handles the cases where the function is called with and without a partition parameter.
