The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by case sensitivity. The function checks if a table exists in Hive, but it compares the table name in a case-sensitive manner. This causes issues when the table name is provided with different casing.

To fix the bug, we should make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function will compare the table name and the output from Hive in a case-insensitive manner, which will resolve the failing tests and address the issue raised in the GitHub reports.
