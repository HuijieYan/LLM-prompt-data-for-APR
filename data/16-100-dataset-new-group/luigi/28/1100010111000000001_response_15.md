The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a few potential error locations. Here's a breakdown of the potential issues and their impact on the failing test:

1. The conditional check for `stdout` in the first `if` statement of the function may not work as expected. If `run_hive_cmd` does not return any output, `stdout` will be an empty string, which evaluates to `False`. This may lead to unexpected results when checking for the existence of the table.
 
2. In the else part of the function, the condition `if stdout` is used to return `True` or `False`. However, this may not accurately represent the existence of the table in the specified partition.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function to handle the different scenarios more effectively.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we split the output by newline character and check if the table exists in the list of tables returned from the `show tables` command. Additionally, we use `bool(stdout)` to directly return the truthiness of the `stdout` variable in the case of checking for table existence in a partition.

With these changes, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test.
