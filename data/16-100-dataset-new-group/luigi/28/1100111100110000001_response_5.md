The bug in the provided code is likely in the `table_exists` function, specifically when the `stdout` is being checked to determine whether a table exists in the database or not. The logic for checking the existence of a table seems to be incorrect, causing the failing test cases.

The error message indicates that the test is expecting the table to exist and is getting `False` instead. This suggests that the failing logic is the second condition that checks for the existence of the table. There is an issue in determining whether the table exists or not based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the existence of the table should be adjusted based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {}.{}".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and partition in stdout
```

In this corrected version, the condition for checking the existence of the table and partition has been adjusted. The `table_exists` function now checks whether the table or partition is present in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.
