The buggy function is the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. This method is responsible for determining whether a specific table exists in a given database.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the conditionals and the logic used to check if the table exists.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking for the existence of the table in the database and is returning incorrect results, leading to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the existence of the table needs to be revised. More specifically, when the `stdout` is returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function, the function needs to correctly parse and validate the data to determine if the table exists or not.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `show tables` command has been modified to `show tables in` and the logic for validating the `stdout` has been improved. This should address the issue and pass the failing tests.
