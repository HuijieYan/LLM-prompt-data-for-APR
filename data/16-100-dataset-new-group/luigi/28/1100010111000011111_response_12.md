### The buggy function and its relationship with the failing test code, the expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue
Based on the failing test and expected input/output values, the buggy function `table_exists` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is failing to properly check if a table exists in Hive. The issue stems from the fact that the function does not account for case insensitivity, causing the test to fail when dealing with tables that have different case styles.

### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error is in the comparison logic where the table name is compared to the contents of stdout without any case-insensitive checks.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug arises from the fact that Hive is case insensitive, so the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive as well. If the table name is provided in a different case style, it will fail to be detected as existing in Hive because the current implementation does not account for case insensitivity.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking the existence of the table in Hive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the function includes converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in Hive. This version of the function should pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported in GitHub.
