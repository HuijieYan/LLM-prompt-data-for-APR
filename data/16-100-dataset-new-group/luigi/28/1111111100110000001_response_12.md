The issue with the buggy function `table_exists` is that it is using the `stdout` variable to validate the result, which is causing the bug. If stdout is an empty string or None, the function will return False regardless of the existence of the table. This is what caused the failing test cases.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to check if the `stdout` is not None or empty before evaluating the table existence. Then, if `stdout` contains table information, checking should be done in a case-insensitive manner to match the table names. Finally, return the result accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_cmd})'
        )

        return stdout is not None and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to perform case-insensitive matching and explicitly checking for `None` or empty `stdout`, the corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
