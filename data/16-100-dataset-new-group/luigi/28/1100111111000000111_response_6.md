The buggy function table_exists in luigi/contrib/hive.py fails to check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, causing tests to fail, and resulting in GitHub Issue #896.

The cause of the bug:
The buggy function uses the run_hive_cmd function to execute a Hive command to check for table existence. However, it does not consider case insensitivity for table names. This leads to failing test cases when trying to check for tables with different case styles.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, modify the table_exists function to compare the table name with the output from stdout in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table parameter and the output from stdout are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

This should resolve the failing test cases and address GitHub Issue #896.
