The buggy function is `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The error is due to case sensitivity in the comparison of table names when checking for table existence.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for case sensitivity in the comparison of table names. This causes the test cases to fail when comparing the expected output with the actual output. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the input table name and the output table name to lowercase for comparison. We can use the `lower()` method to achieve this.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output name to lowercase for comparison, the function will now be case insensitive and satisfy the expected input/output values as well as resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
