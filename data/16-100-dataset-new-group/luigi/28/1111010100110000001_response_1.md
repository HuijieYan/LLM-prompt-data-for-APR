The problem with the function `table_exists` is that it is not properly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It seems to be returning the opposite of what was expected, leading to assertion errors in the failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. When the table exists, the function should return `True`, but in the current implementation, it seems to be returning `False` when the table exists and `True` when it doesn't.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to update the logic of the `table_exists` function to correctly interpret the output of `run_hive_cmd` and return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout  # Return True if the table is in the stdout, otherwise False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, otherwise False
```

In this corrected version, we return `table in stdout` directly to check if the table exists in the `stdout`. In the second part, we return `bool(stdout)` to handle the case when the table exists.
