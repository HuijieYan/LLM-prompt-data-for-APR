The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test cases due to incorrect return values. The issue is with the conditional logic inside the function, specifically with how the `stdout` variable is being checked for True/False values before returning.

The bug is causing incorrect evaluation of the return value, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `stdout` variable is properly evaluated before returning. Additionally, we need to handle the case-insensitive comparison of table names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Previous function definitions

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout is not None and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout is not None
```

By using the `is not None` check for `stdout` and using `lower()` to compare table names, we ensure that the function returns the correct values for the test cases.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
