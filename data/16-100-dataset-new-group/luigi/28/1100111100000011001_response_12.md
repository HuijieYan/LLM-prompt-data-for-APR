The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not correctly generating the command to check if a table exists when a partition is specified. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with incorrect parameters in the else block.

To fix this bug, we need to update the else block so that it correctly generates the command to check for the existence of a partition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            # Use the correct format to generate the command to check for partition existence
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and partition in stdout
```

With this correction, the function will now accurately check for the existence of a table with or without a specified partition, and it will return the expected values and types for the given test cases.
