The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the tests to fail because it does not account for case sensitivity. The function incorrectly checks if the table name matches the output from the `run_hive_cmd`, which may not account for case differences. This is reflected in the failing tests, where the `table_exists` function returns False even when the table actually exists.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case insensitive. This will make the function more robust and prevent the tests from failing due to case differences.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. Instead of a direct comparison between `table` and `stdout`, `table.lower()` is used to check for case-insensitive matches.
2. For the case when `partition` is not None, `bool(stdout)` is directly returned, as we only need to check if `stdout` has some value.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted in GitHub. The fix makes the comparison case insensitive, ensuring that table names are correctly identified even with case differences.
