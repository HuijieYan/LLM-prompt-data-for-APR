The bug in the `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it is not handling case insensitivity for table names. The issue on GitHub (Issue #896) outlines the problem and the proposed solution, which is to check the standard output against the lowercase version of the table name.

The buggy function's current logic does not account for case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the database. The failing test cases also demonstrate the problem by passing table names in different case formats.

To fix the bug, the function needs to update the logic for comparing the table name against the standard output to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the standard output to lower case for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. This will allow the function to pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
