To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, the condition for checking if the `table` exists in the `stdout` needs to be made case-insensitive. Also, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be mocked in the test function to return case-insensitive strings for table names.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, the `table` and `stdout` are both converted to lowercase before comparing to make the comparison case-insensitive. This change should address the failing test cases and also resolve the GitHub issue regarding making `table_exists` case-insensitive.
