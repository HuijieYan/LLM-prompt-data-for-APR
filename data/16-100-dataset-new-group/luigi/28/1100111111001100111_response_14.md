The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is failing the test cases because it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database.

The `table_exists` function currently compares the table name directly with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which may not match in cases where the table name is in a different case than the output returned by Hive.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from `run_hive_cmd` to handle case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases, and it also addresses the GitHub issues related to the case insensitivity of table names in Hive.
