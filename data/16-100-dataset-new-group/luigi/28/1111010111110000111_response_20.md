The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is supposed to check for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

The cause of the bug is that the comparison in the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing the test case for table existence to fail when dealing with differently-cased table names. The GitHub issue #896 suggests that the `table_exists` function should be case-insensitive. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison between table names and the output from `run_hive_cmd` case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in stdout.split()]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This modified version of the function uses `table.lower()` in the comparison with the lowercase names of the tables found in the `stdout` output. This allows for a case-insensitive comparison between table names, addressing the issue reported in GitHub.
