The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class lies in the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue notes on GitHub suggest that the comparison should be case insensitive, as Hive is not case sensitive when it comes to table names.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` needs to be made case insensitive. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the table name and the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output.

This fix should resolve the failing tests and the issues reported on GitHub. It ensures that the comparison between table names and the Hive command output is case insensitive, as noted in the GitHub issue.
