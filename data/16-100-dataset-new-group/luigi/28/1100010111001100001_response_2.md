The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the inconsistent use of the returned `stdout` variable. In some cases, the function checks if `stdout` contains a specific string, while in others it checks if `stdout` is truthy. This inconsistency leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function consistently checks the `stdout` variable in the same way in all cases.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we consistently use the `in` operator to check if `table` is in `stdout` when `partition` is None. When `partition` is not None, we simply return the truthiness of `stdout`.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
