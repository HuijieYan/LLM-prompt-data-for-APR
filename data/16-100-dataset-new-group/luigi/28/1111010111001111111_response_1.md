The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case-insensitive, causing tests to fail when checking for the existence of tables. This has been identified in GitHub issue #896, where the problem was reported along with a suggested fix.

To fix the bug, the function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout` result. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison and pass the failing tests. This fix also aligns with the suggested solution in GitHub issue #896.
