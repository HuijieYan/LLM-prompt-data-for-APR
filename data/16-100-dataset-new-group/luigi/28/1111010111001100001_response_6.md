The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing it to sometimes return incorrect values, leading to failed tests. It appears to be caused by the conditional statements not properly handling the different cases. The function is not returning the correct boolean value based on the presence of the table or partition in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements need to be adjusted to correctly handle the different cases and properly return either `True` or `False` based on the existence of the table or partition in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version correctly handles the output of `run_hive_cmd` and returns the appropriate boolean values for the existence of the table or partition.
