The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, without considering case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle tables with different casing and return the expected results for the given test cases. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
