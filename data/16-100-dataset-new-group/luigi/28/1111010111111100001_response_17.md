The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly checks the existence of a table in the database. It returns the wrong value when the stdout variable is not an empty string, which causes the test cases to fail.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect comparison of the stdout variable to check the existence of a table. The function erroneously assumes that the presence of the table in the stdout indicates its existence, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the presence of the exact table name in the output, rather than just checking for the presence of stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return any(table_name.lower() == table.lower() for table_name in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(table_name.lower() == table.lower() for table_name in stdout.split('\n'))
```

This corrected version uses the `any` function to iterate through the output and check if the table name exists in the output. It also converts both the table name and the output table names to lowercase using `lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
