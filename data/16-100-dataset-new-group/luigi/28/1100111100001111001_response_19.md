The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that the conditional statement that checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database is incorrect. It is not properly handling the case where the table name is included in the `stdout` but is not an exact match.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditional statement to check if the table name is included in the `stdout` rather than being an exact match. This can be achieved using the `in` keyword in Python.

Additionally, the function `run_hive_cmd` should be properly mocked for testing the `stdout` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the case where the table name is included in the `stdout` rather than being an exact match, and return the expected outputs for all the provided test cases.
