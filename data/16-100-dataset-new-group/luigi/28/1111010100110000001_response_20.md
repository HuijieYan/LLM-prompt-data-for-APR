The buggy function `table_exists` has a logical bug in the condition for checking the existence of a table. In the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`, the expected behavior is to check if the table exists in the output from the command, but this condition has an incorrect logic. The condition should check whether the table is a substring of the returned value, and not just that the stdout is not empty.

The buggy function has another issue where the `show partitions` command is being constructed incorrectly due to incorrect string formatting, which leads to incorrect behavior in parsing tables.

To fix the bug, the logical condition `return stdout and table in stdout` should be changed to `return table in stdout` to properly check if the table exists in the output. Additionally, the string formatting in the `show partitions` command should be fixed or refactored to construct the command correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return table in stdout  # Changed condition to properly check table existence
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            return bool(stdout)  # Checking if stdout is not empty for table existence
```
This corrected version properly checks the existence of the table by using the `in` keyword to check for a substring. Additionally, the `show partitions` command construction has been fixed to ensure the correct command is sent to the hive client.
