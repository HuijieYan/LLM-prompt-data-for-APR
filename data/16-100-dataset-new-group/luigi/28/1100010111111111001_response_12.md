The bug in the function `table_exists` is that it does not properly handle the case where `show tables` or `show partitions` commands return the expected table/partition name. When the table/partition is found, the function should return `True`, but it does not handle this case correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to check for the existence of the table/partition in the `stdout` and return `True` if it's found, and `False` if it's not found.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

The modification in the first part of the if statement allows for splitting the `stdout` into lines and checking if the table is listed. In the second part of the if statement, `bool(stdout)` directly evaluates the `stdout` to determine if it is empty or not, and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

This corrected code should pass all the failing test cases.
