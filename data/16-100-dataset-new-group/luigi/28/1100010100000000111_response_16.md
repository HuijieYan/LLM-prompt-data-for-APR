Issues:

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This has been brought up as an issue on GitHub, with a proposed fix to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

Causes of the bug:

The bug arises because the function does not perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the tables returned from the Hive database. This causes the function to fail when checking for tables with capitalized names.

Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the tables returned from the Hive database, making the comparison case insensitive.

Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
