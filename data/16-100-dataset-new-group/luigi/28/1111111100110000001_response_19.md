The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists by running a Hive command and checking the output. It accepts a `partition` parameter, and if a partition is provided, it dynamically creates a Hive command to check if the partition exists.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the conditional check in the `if` and `else` block. The bug might be due to the way the function is determining the existence of a table or partition based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, the handling of the `partition` parameter may not be correct.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` appropriately and check for the existence of the table or partition using the correct logic. Additionally, the function needs to handle the `partition` parameter correctly to generate the appropriate Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... class implementation ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_cmd))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if `partition` is `None`. If it is, it constructs the Hive command to check for the existence of the table directly. If not, it generates the partition specification and constructs the Hive command to check for the existence of the partition.

These changes should address the bug and make the function return the correct result as expected by the tests.
