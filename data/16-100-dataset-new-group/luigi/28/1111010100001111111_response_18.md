The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database and is used to run Hive commands.

The bug in the function is that it's case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table, while Hive is case-insensitive. The function does not account for the case of the table name when checking in the `stdout` variable, leading to incorrect results when the case of the table name doesn't match that in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase and then do the comparison. This way, the function will be case-insensitive as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # No need for an if-else check, just return the boolean value directly
```

With this corrected version, the function will perform a case-insensitive check for the table name in the `stdout` variable and return the appropriate boolean result. This implementation aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the GitHub issue related to case-insensitivity.
