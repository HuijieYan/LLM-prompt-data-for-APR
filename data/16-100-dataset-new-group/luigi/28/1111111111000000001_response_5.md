The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way it handles the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking for the existence of a table, especially when a partition is specified.

The bug appears to be in the `else` block of the `table_exists` function, where it calls `run_hive_cmd` and attempts to construct the command to check for the existence of a table with a specified partition. The issue lies in how the partition is being passed to the `self.partition_spec` function, which may not be returning the expected partition specification.

To fix this bug, we may need to update the `partition_spec` function to ensure it correctly constructs the partition specification.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        if isinstance(partition, dict):
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            partition_spec = 'partition ({})'.format(partition_str)
        else:
            partition_spec = 'partition ({})'.format(partition)

        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}'.format(database, table, partition_spec))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we handle both dictionary and non-dictionary input for the `partition` parameter, constructing the `partition_spec` accordingly before passing it to the `run_hive_cmd` function. This approach ensures that the correct partition specification is used when checking for the existence of a table with a specified partition.
