The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test cases due to case sensitivity. The `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity, leading to the test cases failing when checking for table existence with different cases.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking table existence in the hive. This change will address the issue reported in GitHub regarding the case sensitivity of table existence checks.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should now perform case-insensitive checks when determining the existence of a table in the hive. This change will resolve the failing test cases and address the GitHub issues related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
