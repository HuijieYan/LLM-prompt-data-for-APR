The bug in the given function `table_exists` is that it produces the wrong result in some instances. The first assertion failure suggests that the function does not correctly return `True` when the table exists, while the second assertion failure suggests that it does not correctly return `False` when the table does not exist.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not handle the case where the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function matches exactly the table name or matches partially, leading to incorrect evaluation of the table existence.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition check for the existence of the table by using the `in` keyword to check if the table name appears exactly or partially within the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By using the `in` keyword and `bool` function to evaluate the existence of the table, it ensures that the correct boolean value is returned, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
