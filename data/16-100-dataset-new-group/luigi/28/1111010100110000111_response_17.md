## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly, causing the test cases to fail. The issue on GitHub (#896) confirms that this is a bug and suggests a fix to make `table_exists` case insensitive.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error is in how the function compares the table names with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from the hive command. The function does not handle case insensitivity correctly, causing the test cases to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name without case sensitivity. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparing them.

## Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
