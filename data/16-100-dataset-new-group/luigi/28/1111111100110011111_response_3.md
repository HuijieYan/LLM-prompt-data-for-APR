To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the table names returned in the stdout is case insensitive.

The `table_exists` function should be modified to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout != ""
```

This corrected version of the function should fix the bug and make the comparison between table names and stdout case insensitive, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
