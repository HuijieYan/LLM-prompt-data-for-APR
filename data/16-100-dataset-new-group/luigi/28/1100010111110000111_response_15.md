## The source code of the corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

By changing the line `return stdout and table in stdout` to `return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()` for both conditions, the bug is fixed and the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

The bug was caused by the case sensitivity of the comparison between the provided table name and the table names in the `stdout`. By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lower case before comparison, the case sensitivity issue is resolved.
