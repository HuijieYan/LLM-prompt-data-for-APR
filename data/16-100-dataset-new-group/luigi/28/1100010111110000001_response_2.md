The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test to receive unexpected results. The failing test is the `test_table_exists` function in the `hive_test.py` file. The error message indicates that the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)` is failing because `False` is not `True`.

The bug within the `table_exists` function is that in both cases (when `partition` is None and when it is not None), the function returns the opposite of what is expected. In the first case, it returns `False` when it should return `True`, and in the second case, it returns `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the correct values are being returned in both cases based on the condition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout is not None and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout is not None
```

The corrected version ensures that the function returns the correct values based on the conditions. Now the failing test `test_table_exists` should pass without any issues.
