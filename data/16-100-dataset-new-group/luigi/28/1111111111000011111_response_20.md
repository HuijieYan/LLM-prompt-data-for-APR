The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the case-sensitivity of the `stdout` when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue can be resolved by converting both the `stdout` and the `table` name to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected function converts both `stdout` and `table` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing. This addresses the issue raised in GitHub and makes the comparison case-insensitive, ensuring that the function passes the failing test cases and resolves the GitHub issue.
