The bug in the given function `table_exists` is in the else part of the function where it always returns `True` instead of evaluating the `stdout` value. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to return based on the evaluation of `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # return based on the evaluation of stdout
```

With this correction, the function now correctly evaluates the `stdout` value in the else part and returns `True` only if `stdout` is not empty.

This change addresses the issue where the function was always returning `True` in the else part, regardless of the `stdout` evaluation. Now the function will return `True` only if `stdout` is not empty, and `False` otherwise.
