## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of `table` with `stdout` is case-sensitive, which can cause the test to fail when the table name is provided in a different case.
2. The use of `and` instead of `in` for checking if the table exists in the `stdout`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` is case-sensitive, leading to test failures when the table name is not provided in the expected case. This is a result of Hive being case-insensitive, but the function not accounting for case sensitivity.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison to be case-insensitive and use the `in` operator instead of `and` to check for the existence of the table in the `stdout`.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
