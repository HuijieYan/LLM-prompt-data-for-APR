Potential error locations within the code:
1. The function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table.

Explanation of the bug:
The bug is with case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function is not designed to handle case insensitivity, and this causes the tests to fail when a table name is provided in a different case than what is present in the database.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the hive database. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the table names retrieved from hive's stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name ('table') and the table names retrieved from stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.
