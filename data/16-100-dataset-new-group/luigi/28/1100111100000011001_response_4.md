The bug in the `table_exists` function is with the `stdout` variable. In both cases, the `stdout` variable is expected to have the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, in the current implementation, the `stdout` variable is not being assigned the correct value.

To fix the bug, the `stdout` variable should be assigned the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function in both cases.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```
