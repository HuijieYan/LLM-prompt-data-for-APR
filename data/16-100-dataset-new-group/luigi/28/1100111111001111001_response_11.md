The bug in the function `table_exists` is likely due to the conditional check on the `stdout` variable. The function checks if `stdout` is truthy in the `if` statement, and it will return `True` if `stdout` is not an empty string. This is incorrect because the function should return `True` only if the table exists in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to validate the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable. Additionally, the `show tables` command needs to be adjusted to handle case-insensitive table name comparisons.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Fixed version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and partition in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables'.format(database))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
```

The fix includes adjusting the conditional statements to check for the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable, along with handling case-insensitive comparisons for table names. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
