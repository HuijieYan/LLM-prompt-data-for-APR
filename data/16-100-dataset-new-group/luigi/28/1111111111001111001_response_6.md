The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not behaving as expected. It fails a series of test cases by returning incorrect values. 

The bug appears to be in the conditional check for the stdout value in the else clause of the function. The function checks if stdout is not empty, which should mean that the table exists, but the wrong comparison is made.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional check in the else clause to compare if the table name is present in the stdout value using the `in` operator.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return table in stdout  # Modified the conditional check
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly identify if a table exists in the database and with the specified partition. This should fix the failing test cases and produce the expected output values.
