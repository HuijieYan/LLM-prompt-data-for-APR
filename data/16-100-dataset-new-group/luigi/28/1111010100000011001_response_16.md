The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the second part of the function, where there is a call to `run_hive_cmd` with a multi-line query using triple quotes. This can lead to the query not being formatted correctly, especially if the partition specification contains special characters or spaces.

To fix this bug, we can use the `subprocess` module to run the hive command as an external process. This will ensure that the query is executed properly regardless of its format.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
import subprocess

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd(['use', database, ';', 'show tables like', table, ';'])
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd(['use', database, ';', 'show partitions', table, 'partition', self.partition_spec(partition)])
            return bool(stdout)

    def run_hive_cmd(self, cmd):
        return subprocess.check_output(['hive', '-e', ' '.join(cmd)]).decode('utf-8').strip()
```

In this corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` function is used to run the hive command as an external process. The `subprocess` module's `check_output` function is used to run the command and capture its output, which is then decoded from bytes to a string and stripped of any whitespace. This ensures that the command is executed properly and the output is in the expected format.
