The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling the case where the `stdout` variable might contain multiple lines. In the second case of the failing test, the function is expecting only the table name in the `stdout`, but the `stdout` contains multiple lines.

To fix this, the function needs to check if the table name is present in each line of the `stdout` and not just check if it's in the entire `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip().split('\n') and any(table in line for line in stdout.strip().split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we use `strip()` to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from the `stdout` and then use `split('\n')` to split the `stdout` into individual lines. We then use the `any` function to check if the table is present in any of the lines.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
