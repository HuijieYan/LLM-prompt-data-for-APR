The potential error in the buggy function is in the logic for checking if a table exists in Hive. The bug is related to case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table, as indicated by the GitHub issue.

The buggy function fails the test because it does not handle case sensitivity well, which leads to the `AssertionError`. The test expects the function to return `True` for a table that exists, regardless of the case used in the input.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to use case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase, allowing for a case-insensitive comparison.

With this change, the updated function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue reported on GitHub by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
