The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file fails to handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This bug is causing the test cases to fail, and it has been reported as issue #896 on the GitHub repository.

The problem is that the function is not considering case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table, leading to incorrect results in the test cases. When the test case checks for the existence of "MyTable" using the `table_exists` function, it fails because the function does not account for case differences and returns a false negative.

To address this bug, the function should convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and will resolve the failing test cases as reported in the GitHub issue.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, which includes the necessary modifications to handle case insensitivity:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive through the use of the `lower()` method for both `table` and `stdout`, the corrected function ensures that the test cases will produce the expected results when verifying the existence of tables. This resolution directly addresses the reported issue on GitHub and fixes the bug in the `table_exists` function.
