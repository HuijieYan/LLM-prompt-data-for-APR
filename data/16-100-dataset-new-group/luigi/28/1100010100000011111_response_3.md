Looking at the provided buggy function, it appears that the issue arises from a case sensitivity problem. The function is not case insensitive when checking the existing tables, which causes discrepancies that lead to test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive by comparing both `table` and `stdout` in lower case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now compares the lowercase versions of both `table` and `stdout`, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison that aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the GitHub issue.
