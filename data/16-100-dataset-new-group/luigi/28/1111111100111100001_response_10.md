The bug in the `table_exists` function is that when a table exists, the function returns False instead of True, and when it doesn't exist, it returns True instead of False.

The bug appears to be in the logic of the conditional statements in the `table_exists` function. When the table exists, the function should return True, and when it doesn't exist, the function should return False.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the conditional statements inside the `table_exists` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # Convert the stdout to a boolean value
```

In the corrected version, we directly return the result of the condition in the if and else blocks, avoiding the unnecessary use of the conditional statements as in the original code. This ensures that the function returns True when the table exists and False when it does not exist.
