The bug exists in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The issue is that the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function is case-sensitive, causing the test cases to fail when the table name case doesn't match the output case. This was discussed in GitHub issue #896.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output needs to be case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is now case-insensitive, as requested in GitHub issue #896. This should fix the failing test cases.
