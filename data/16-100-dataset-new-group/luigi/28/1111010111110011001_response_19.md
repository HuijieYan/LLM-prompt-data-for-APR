To fix the bug in the `table_exists` method, you can directly use the `run_hive_cmd` function to run the query and check if the table exists. Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition (%s)".format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return partition_spec in stdout.split('\n')
```

Explanation:
1. The original code had issues with the conditions and the use of `run_hive_cmd` for checking whether the table exists in Hive. The corrected code uses the `run_hive_cmd` function directly to execute the required Hive queries.
2. The `if` block checks whether a partition is specified, and in that case, it constructs the partition-specific query and checks if the partition exists in the output.
3. The `else` block handles the case where no partition is specified, and it checks if the table exists in the output.
4. The corrected code splits the output of `run_hive_cmd` using `stdout.split('\n')` to check for the presence of the table or partition.

With these changes, the `table_exists` method should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
