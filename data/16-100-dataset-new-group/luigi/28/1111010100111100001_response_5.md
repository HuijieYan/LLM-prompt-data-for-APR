The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` string.

The problem occurs when the function checks if the table exists in the stdout by simply checking if the table name is within the stdout. The bug might be caused by the presence of newline characters in the stdout. The function does not handle this case properly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` to account for the presence of newline characters in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
