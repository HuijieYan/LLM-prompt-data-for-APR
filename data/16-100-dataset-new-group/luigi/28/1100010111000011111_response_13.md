The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue where it performs a case-sensitive check for table existence. This causes the test cases to fail when checking for table existence with different cases.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. The comparison of the `table` value with the `stdout` after lowering it in the `if` condition.
2. The `partition` value is not being used in the function, even though there is a condition for it.

The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` performs a case-sensitive check when comparing the given table name with the existing tables in the database. This causes the test cases to fail as they are expecting case-insensitive table existence checks, as detailed in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the existing tables in the database should be made case-insensitive. It can be achieved by converting both the table name and the existing tables in the database to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the function will perform a case-insensitive check for table existence, which will satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
