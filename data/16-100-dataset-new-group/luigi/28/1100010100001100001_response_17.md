The buggy function seems to be checking whether a table or a partition exists in a Hive database. However, there are some issues related to how the function handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The bug seems to be caused by the way the function checks the presence of a table or a partition in the Hive database. The function is not handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for checking the presence of a table or a partition in the Hive database based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the function checks if the table or partition exists in the Hive database by directly evaluating the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, the logic for handling the `stdout` variable has been simplified to improve readability and maintainability.
