The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive, causing the check for an existing table to fail when the table names are in different cases. The issue on GitHub confirms this and suggests checking `stdout` against the lowercase version of the `table` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by checking the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # This can be simplified to just return the boolean value of `stdout`

# Note: It's important to replace the original `table_exists` function in the luigi/contrib/hive.py file with the corrected version.
```

By checking the lowercase version of both the `table` and the `stdout` in the `table_exists` function, we ensure that the function is case insensitive and the issue reported on GitHub is resolved.
