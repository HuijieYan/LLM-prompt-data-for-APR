To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` method to make it case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` method should now be case insensitive, and it should pass the failing tests.
