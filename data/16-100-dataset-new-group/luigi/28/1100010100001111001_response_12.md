The bug in the provided function is that the logic for checking the existence of a table is incorrect. This is evident from the runtime values and the expected values.

The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the logic for checking the existence of the table in the `table_exists` function.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""show partitions {0}.{1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

The correction includes modifying the query to use `show tables in` instead of `show tables like` and changing `show partitions` command to use the correct syntax. Also, the last if-else block has been simplified to directly return `bool(stdout)` to check for the existence of the table.

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
