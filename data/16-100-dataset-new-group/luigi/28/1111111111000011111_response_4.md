To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` string to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` string to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this modification, the function will now correctly compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test cases.
