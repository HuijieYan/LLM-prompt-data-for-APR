The issue with the `table_exists` function lies in the conditionals for checking if the table exists. For the first conditional, the function checks if the `stdout` isn't empty and if the `table` is in the `stdout`. However, the second conditional only checks if the `stdout` isn't empty, regardless of the contents.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the second conditional also checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` when a partition is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table in stdout
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing tests.
