The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is due to the incorrect comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name. 

In the first set of runtime inputs, the value of `stdout` is `'OK'`, but the function expects the table name to be in the output. This causes the comparison to fail, leading to the test failure.

In the second set of runtime inputs, the value of `stdout` is `'OK\nmytable'`, which should pass the table existence check. However, due to case sensitivity, the comparison fails, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly check for the existence of the table name in the `stdout` output and consider case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables if t)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With the corrected version, the provided failing tests should now pass.
