The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is failing because it is not handling the case sensitivity issue described in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case insensitivity of table names in Hive. When checking for an existing table, for example, if a table named 'FooBar' is checked, Hive will return it as 'foobar', causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the tables returned from Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With these modifications, the function should now handle the case insensitivity issue and return the correct results.

This approach uses the `any()` function to check if there is at least one table in `stdout` which matches the specified `table` name in a case-insensitive manner. We also use `bool(stdout)` in the partition check to handle the case where the partitions are present.

By using these modifications, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
