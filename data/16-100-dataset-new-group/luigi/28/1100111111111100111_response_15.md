The issue occurs because the `table_exists` function does not handle case-insensitive table names correctly. As a result, the test cases fail when checking for table existence using different casing.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name from the function's input with the table name in the `stdout` in a case-insensitive manner. This will ensure that table existence is determined regardless of the casing of the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions from the same class

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The correction involves converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive, ensuring that the correct table existence is determined regardless of the casing.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in both GitHub issues and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
