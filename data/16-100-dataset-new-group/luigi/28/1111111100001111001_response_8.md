The bug in the provided function is that the partition condition is being passed incorrectly to the `run_hive_cmd` function. Also, the condition to check for the existence of the table in the database is not accurate. The function is returning `stdout and table in stdout`, which will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty and `table` is present in it, but this is not necessarily the accurate representation of the table existence in the database.

To fix this bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called with the correct partition condition, and the existence of the table in the database should be checked reliably.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return 'OK' in stdout  # Check if 'OK' is present in stdout
    else:
        partition_condition = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_condition})")
        
        return len(stdout.strip()) > 0  # Check if the stdout is not empty
```

In the corrected version, we are now checking for the presence of the string 'OK' in the output of the `show tables` command to determine the existence of the table in the database. For the partitioned case, we are now constructing the partition condition properly and checking if the `stdout` is not empty.

This should address the issues in the original buggy function and handle the provided test cases correctly.
