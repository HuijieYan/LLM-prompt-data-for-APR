## The corrected version of the function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The bug was that the `table_exists` function was not case insensitive, causing issues with table names that were capitalized or in a different case than expected. The corrected function uses the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison, fixing the case sensitivity issue. This change addresses the GitHub issue and satisfies all the expected input/output values and types.
