The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the logic for checking if the table exists is incorrect. In the first case, the function should return True if the table is found in the stdout, and in the second case, the function should return True if the partition is found in the stdout.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to correctly check for the existence of tables and partitions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return partition in stdout
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly check for the existence of tables and partitions, satisfying all the expected values and types in the failing test cases.
