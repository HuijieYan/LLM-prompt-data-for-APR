The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive. The buggy function fails in cases where the table name is not in lowercase, as Hive returns the table names as lowercase.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the function will compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive, resolving the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
