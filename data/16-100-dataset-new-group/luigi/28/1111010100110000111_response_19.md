### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not performing a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This causes the failing test cases due to differences in case sensitivity. The GitHub issue confirms that the function needs to be made case insensitive to match the behavior of Hive.

### Identified Error:
The potential error location is at the comparison of table name with the output from the Hive command.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `table_exists` does not perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This causes the function to incorrectly determine the existence of the table based on case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table in the Hive output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before checking for table existence. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue's suggestion to make the comparison case insensitive.
