The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug that causes it to fail the test cases. The bug is related to the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive database. The tables in Hive are case insensitive, but the `table_exists` function does not handle this correctly, leading to test failures.

The bug occurs when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, which may not match due to case sensitivity. This results in incorrect outputs and failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to make the comparison case insensitive. The table name should be converted to lowercase before checking if it exists in the Hive command output. This will ensure that the comparison is accurate and the function will return the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the function now correctly handles the case sensitivity of table names in Hive, and it should pass the failing test cases. This fix also addresses the GitHub issues related to the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
