The buggy function `table_exists` has multiple issues that need to be fixed. 

The function accepts a `table` and `database` as arguments and is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The first issue is in the `if` statement, where the function checks if `partition` is `None`. When this condition is true, the function uses the `run_hive_command` to check if the table exists and returns the result. However, the comparison of the `table` name is case sensitive, which causes the function to fail when comparing tables with different cases.

The recommended strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This approach ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method for comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the bug and making the function compatible with the failing test case and the reported issue on GitHub.
