The potential error in the `table_exists` function is the usage of `self.partition_spec(partition)`, which is calling the `partition_spec` function from the `HiveClient` class, instead of the `partition_spec` function from the `HiveCommandClient` class.

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using `self.partition_spec(partition)` to get the partition spec, but it is actually calling the `partition_spec` function from the `HiveClient` class, not from the `HiveCommandClient` class. This can lead to incorrect results or errors.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `self.partition_spec(partition)` with `partition_spec(partition)`. This will ensure that the `partition_spec` function from the `HiveCommandClient` class is called to get the partition spec.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
