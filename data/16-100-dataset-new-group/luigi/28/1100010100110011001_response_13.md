The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking the value of `stdout` before returning a boolean value. It is simply returning `stdout` or the presence of `stdout` instead of performing the expected comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to check whether the `stdout` contains the table name in the first two test cases and return a boolean accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return 'OK' in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return 'OK' in stdout
```

With this corrected function, it should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
