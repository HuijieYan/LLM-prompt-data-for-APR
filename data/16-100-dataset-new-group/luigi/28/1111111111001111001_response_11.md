The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the outputs from `run_hive_cmd` are handled. Specifically, the function fails to check whether a table exists when `show tables` returns the table name in multiple lines combined into a single string.

The bug is likely to be in the line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
In this line, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` checks whether `stdout` is not an empty string and whether `table` is in `stdout`. However, when the table name is returned in multiple lines, this condition will always return `True`, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if `table` exists in any of the lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle cases where the table name is returned in multiple lines, as well as pass all the failing test cases.
