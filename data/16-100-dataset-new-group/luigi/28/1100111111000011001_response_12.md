The buggy function `table_exists` is failing for the given test cases because of the incorrect logic to check the existence of a table with or without a partition. 

In the first case, the function is failing because it does not handle the scenario when `run_hive_cmd` returns "OK" as a response, marking the table as non-existent. 

In the second case, the function is not properly handling the scenario where the `run_hive_cmd` returns a list of tables separated by a new line character. 

Similarly, in the third and fourth cases where partitions are involved, the function is failing to handle the response from `run_hive_cmd` properly. 

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the responses from `run_hive_cmd` for both cases - with and without partitions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = ' and '.join(['{0} = \'{1}\''.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_string))
        return len(stdout.split('\n')) > 1
```

The corrected function now properly handles the response from `run_hive_cmd` for both cases of checking the existence of a table with or without a partition.

This new implementation should pass all the provided test cases as it appropriately handles the responses from `run_hive_cmd` for table existence checks.
