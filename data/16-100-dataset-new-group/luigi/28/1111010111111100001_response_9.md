Based on the failing test cases and the provided code, the issue seems to be with the table_exists function. The bug results in the function returning incorrect values, which leads to failing assertions in the test cases.

The bug occurs because the logic for checking table existence and partition existence is not implemented correctly. Specifically, the return value based on the presence of the table or partition in the stdout is incorrect.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to re-implement the table_exists function to correctly parse the output from the run_hive_cmd function and determine the existence of the table or partition based on that output.

Here's a corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version checks for the existence of the table or partition based on whether it is present in the stdout. Additionally, it handles the presence of multiple items in the stdout and correctly parses them. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
