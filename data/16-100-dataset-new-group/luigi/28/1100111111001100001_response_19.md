The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the incorrect if-else logic, as well as the use of the `and` and `or` operators while checking the value of `stdout`. Additionally, in case of non-empty `stdout`, the function is returning `True` instead of checking if the `table` is in the `stdout`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is:
- Update the if-else logic to properly handle both cases when `partition` is `None` and when it is not.
- Modify the condition to check if the `table` is in the `stdout` when `stdout` is not empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Convert stdout to boolean

# Note: You may need to adjust the use of mocked objects in the test to match the corrected function
```

With these corrections, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
