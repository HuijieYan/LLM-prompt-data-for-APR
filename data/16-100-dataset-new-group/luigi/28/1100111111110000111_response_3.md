To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison of the table name and the stdout to be case insensitive. 

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will be able to handle case-insensitive matching, as requested in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version of the function will pass the failing tests and address the case sensitivity issue raised in the GitHub issue.
