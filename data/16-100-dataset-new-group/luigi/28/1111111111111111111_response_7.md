The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing because it is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This issue was raised in GitHub as issue #896.

To fix the bug, the function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the table names in the Hive database. This will make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function to fix the bug:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    # ... other functions ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        # Convert the table name to lowercase for case insensitive comparison
        table = table.lower()
        
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.lower()  # Also convert stdout to lowercase
        else:
            # Convert table name to lowercase before comparing it with partition_spec output
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function will be case insensitive when checking for table existence, and it will fix the failing tests and address the issue raised in GitHub.
