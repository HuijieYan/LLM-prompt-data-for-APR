The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists in the database. This causes the failing test cases where the table name is in a different case than expected.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, the function is now case insensitive when checking for table existence.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
