The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class, where it incorrectly checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The issue is that the function does not account for case sensitivity, which results in failing tests when the table names differ in case.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the failing tests as described in the GitHub issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparing them. This modification will ensure that the case sensitivity issue is resolved and the tests pass successfully.
