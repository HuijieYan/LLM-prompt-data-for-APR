The buggy function table_exists() is designed to check if a table exists in a given database for a given partition. In the given buggy function, there are two main issues:
1. The 'run_hive_cmd' function is being called without proper implementation.
2. In the else condition, the function directly checks if stdout is truthy or not.

The bug in the function is that when checking for the existence of a table, there's a missing command to actually check for the table itself.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to properly implement the 'run_hive_cmd' function so that it actually runs the Hive command and returns the output. Additionally, the else condition should be modified to handle the partition-related logic instead of just directly checking the truthiness of stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; SHOW PARTITIONS %s where %s""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
