The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not properly handling the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It is failing to correctly determine whether the table exists in the specified database.

The issue arises when processing the `stdout` variable after running the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is checking for the presence of the table string in the `stdout`, but it fails to handle cases where there may be additional text after the table name. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the `stdout` is checked for the presence of the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # other functions remain unchanged

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))  # modified command

            # Check if the table exists in the stdout
            return any(t == table for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            # Check if any partitions exist in the stdout
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

By splitting the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checking if the table name is present in the split tokens, we ensure that we correctly identify the presence of the table in the specified database.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
