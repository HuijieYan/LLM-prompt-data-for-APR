The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case-insensitive string comparison, which leads to test failures when the table names are in different cases. The issue has been raised on GitHub, and it is suggested to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive. The function should return `True` if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner, otherwise `False`.

To fix the bug, modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. Then, update the function to check if the table lowercase exists in the stdout lowercase, which will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this modification, the function will now compare the table name and the stdout in a case-insensitive manner, which should resolve the test failures and the issue raised on GitHub.
