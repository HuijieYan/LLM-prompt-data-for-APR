The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it doesn't account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This is raised as an issue on GitHub (Issue #896), where the suggestion is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to use a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table in Hive. We can achieve this by comparing the lowercase version of both the table name and the output from Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

This should address the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue. After making this change, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the problem with case sensitivity in table existence checks.
