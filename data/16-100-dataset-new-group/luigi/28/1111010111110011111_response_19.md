The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. The `table_exists` function should be case insensitive, but it currently does not handle this properly, causing the test cases to fail when the table names are in different cases.

The issue can be fixed by modifying the function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

To fix the bug, here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function will convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case insensitive and resolving the failing test cases. This corrected version should also satisfy all the expected input/output values and resolve the issues posted on GitHub.
