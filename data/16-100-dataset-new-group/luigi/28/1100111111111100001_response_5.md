Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the conditional checks for the presence of the table or its partitions. The function is not handling the cases correctly, resulting in failing tests.

The bug can be observed in the failing tests when it checks whether a table exists or not. The function is not correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine the existence of the table.

The bug can be fixed by:
- Correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine the existence of the table.
- Handling the case when the table name is present in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
- Modifying the conditional statements to ensure that the function returns the correct values for both table existence and non-existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

By modifying the function to correctly parse the output of `run_hive_cmd` and handle the conditional checks appropriately, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
