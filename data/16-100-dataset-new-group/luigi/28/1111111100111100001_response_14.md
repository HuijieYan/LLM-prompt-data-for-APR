The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how it uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to check for the existence of a table in a database, including a partition. The failing tests are indicating that the function is returning unexpected results. 

When observing the failing test cases and their inputs and outputs, it's clear that the issue lies in how the function handles case sensitivity, as well as how it constructs the querying command.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to account for case insensitivity when checking for table existence and to properly construct the command for querying partitions.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_clause = ' and '.join(f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items())
            cmd = f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_clause})'
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
            return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the function now accounts for case insensitivity when checking for table existence and correctly constructs the command for querying partitions. This should resolve the failing tests.
