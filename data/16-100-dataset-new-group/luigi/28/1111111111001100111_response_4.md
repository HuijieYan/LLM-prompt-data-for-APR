The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name casing doesn't match exactly with the casing in the Hive database.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name case-insensitively with the table names in the Hive database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `table` and `stdout` values are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, and the function will return the correct result.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
