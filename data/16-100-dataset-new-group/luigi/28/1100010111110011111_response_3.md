### The buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, the corresponding error message, the expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue:

The buggy function `table_exists` is being tested by the `test_table_exists` function, which is part of the `HiveCommandClientTest` class in the `hive_test.py` file. The failing test results in an `AssertionError` with the message "False is not true". The expected input/output values and types are provided for four different cases.

The GitHub issue #896 describes the problem as the `table_exists` function being case sensitive, and it suggests making it case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:

The potential error lies in the comparison of the `table` name with the `stdout` string.

### Cause of the bug:

The buggy function is case sensitive, and it does not properly handle case sensitivity issues as mentioned in the GitHub issue. When the `table` name is compared with the `stdout` string, the comparison fails when there is a case mismatch, leading to the failing test and the `AssertionError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` string to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the function:
1. The comparison of `table` and `stdout` is made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.
2. The `stdout` check is simplified to `bool(stdout)` to return `True` if `stdout` is not empty.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to case insensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
