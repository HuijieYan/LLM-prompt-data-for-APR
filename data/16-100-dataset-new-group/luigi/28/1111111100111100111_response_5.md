The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive, resulting in test failures. This is because the function checks for an exact match between the table name and the name retrieved from the Hive output, which is case-insensitive. The fix involves converting both table names to lowercase before comparison.

To fix the bug, update the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the names retrieved from the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will convert both the table name and the names retrieved from the Hive output to lowercase, allowing for a case-insensitive comparison and resolving the failing tests.
