The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the logic to check if the table exists is incorrect. The function is returning the value of `stdout` and checking if the `table` is in it, which is not right.

The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function should be checking for the existence of the table in the Hive database but instead, it is running a query to list tables and then checking if the `table` parameter is in the result. This can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the function should run a query to directly check for the existence of the table in the database, using a query like `DESCRIBE FORMATTED table_name`. 

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other existing functions here
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("DESCRIBE FORMATTED {0}.{1}".format(database, table))
            return "does not exist" not in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("show partitions {0}.{1} PARTITION ({2})".format(database, table, partition_query))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version directly queries the Hive database using the `run_hive_cmd` function to check for the existence of the table or partition, and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the query result.
