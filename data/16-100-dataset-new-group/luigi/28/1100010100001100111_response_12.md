The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it does not consider case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. This is reported in the GitHub issue as well: "Sometimes we have tables that are defined as capitalized, rather than lower case underscored names. These are easier to read in code if left capitalized, though hive is case insensitive, and will return them as lower case." The bug occurs when checking for an existing table with a name in a different case than what is returned by Hive, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner. The function should convert both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` are used to convert the table name and retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison, making the check case-insensitive as intended.
