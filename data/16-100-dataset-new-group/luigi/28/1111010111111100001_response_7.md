The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition to check whether a table exists or not is incorrect. Regardless of whether data is returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function, the current implementation always returns `True` if data is returned and `False` if no data is returned. This is not correct and is causing the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to check the actual content of the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists or not. If the table exists, the `stdout` will contain the table name. If it doesn't exist, the `stdout` will be empty.

We can use the `in` operator to check if the table name is present in the `stdout` to determine if the table exists or not.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout has content, else return False
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly determine if the table exists or not, and the failing test cases should pass.
