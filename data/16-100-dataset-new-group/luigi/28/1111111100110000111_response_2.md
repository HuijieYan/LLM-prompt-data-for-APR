The potential error in the buggy function is a case sensitivity issue with the table name when checking for table existence in Hive. The function does not handle case insensitivity, causing the test to fail when checking for table existence.

The bug occurs due to the comparison of the table name without considering case sensitivity. The function checks if the table exists by comparing the exact table name from the database with the table name from the `run_hive_cmd` stdout. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison fails in some cases when the table names have different cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
```

In the corrected version, we use `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))` to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name from the database and the names fetched from Hive.

The issue should be resolved by making the code case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.
