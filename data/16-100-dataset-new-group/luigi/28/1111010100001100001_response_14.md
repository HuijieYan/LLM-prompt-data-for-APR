The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the stdout variable is being checked and returned. The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the expected stdout value when checking for the existence of a table or partition in the Hive database. 

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the logic for checking the stdout value and returning a boolean result accordingly. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle the case of a partition being specified.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return True if stdout else False
```
