The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This is causing issues when comparing table names with different cases, resulting in failing tests as described in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not checking for table existence in a case-insensitive manner. Instead, it directly compares the table name with the contents of stdout, which might not match in case.

To fix this bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the stdout content to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

Now, with the corrected function, the comparison for table existence is done in a case-insensitive manner, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
