The issue with the buggy function `table_exists` is that it is not handling the case where the output `stdout` contains multiple lines properly. It only checks if the `stdout` is not empty, and if so, returns `True`. This is causing the test to fail because the function returns `False` when it encounters multiple lines in `stdout`. The function should be modified to handle this case by checking if the table exists in the output.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function `table_exists`:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... other methods

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_clause = ''  # Construct partition clause
            for key, value in partition.items():
                partition_clause += f"{key}='{value}',"
            partition_clause = partition_clause.rstrip(',')
            query = f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_clause})"
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
            return stdout and f"{partition_clause}" in stdout
```

This corrected function adds a new case for handling the scenario when a partition is provided. It constructs the partition clause based on the partition dictionary and then checks if the constructed partition exists in the output `stdout`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
