The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not properly checking for the existence of the table in the 'stdout' variable, which is supposed to contain the result of the Hive command execution. The function is returning the opposite of what is expected due to incorrect logic.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to check if the 'stdout' variable contains the table name when no partition is specified. For the case when a partition is specified, the logic needs to check if the 'stdout' variable is not empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
