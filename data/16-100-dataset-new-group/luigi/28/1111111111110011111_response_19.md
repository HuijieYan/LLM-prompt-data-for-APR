Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Rest of the functions remain the same

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Explanation:
- The issue with the original function was that it checked for an exact match between the table name and the stdout, which caused problems in cases of case differences.
- The fix involves converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.
- By doing so, the function becomes case-insensitive and should pass the failing tests.

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy all the provided test cases and resolve the issue reported in GitHub (issue #896).
