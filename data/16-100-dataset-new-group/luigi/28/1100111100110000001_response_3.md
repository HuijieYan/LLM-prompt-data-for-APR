The bug in the given code is that it does not correctly handle case sensitivity when checking if a table exists. Specifically, the code fails to account for the case when the table name is different from the case used in the Hive query.

1. There are multiple functions in the same file and class that are being referenced within the `table_exists` function and are related to interacting with Hive, such as `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec`.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the condition `table in stdout` and in the `self.partition_spec(partition)` where the partition is not being correctly handled.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for variations in the case of table names when checking for their existence, leading to failures in the test cases with different case table names.

4. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to convert all table names to lowercase when comparing them to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and to ensure that the partition format for `stdout` is correct.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

            if stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n')):
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            partition_command = f"{database}.{table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})"
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {partition_command}")

            return stdout is not None
```

In the corrected version, a case-insensitive comparison is used to check if the table exists in the `stdout`, and the `partition_spec(partition)` is used to correctly format the partition command for `stdout`.
