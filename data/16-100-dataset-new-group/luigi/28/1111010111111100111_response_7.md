The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is causing the tests to fail due to case sensitivity issues. When checking for the table existence, the function does not handle the case sensitivity properly. This is highlighted in the GitHub issue as well, indicating that Hive is case insensitive, and the function should consider this when checking for table existence.

The most likely cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case insensitivity correctly, leading to assertion errors in the failing tests. The runtime input/output values also indicate that the function does not handle case sensitivity as expected.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase (or uppercase) before performing the comparison to ensure case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison is performed, ensuring that the table existence check is case insensitive.

This fix should resolve the failing tests and address the issue posted on GitHub as well.
