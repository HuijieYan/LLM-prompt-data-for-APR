The problem with the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when comparing the table name to the tables listed in the Hive database. This issue has been reported on GitHub, with the suggestion to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The fix involves converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison to check for the existence of the table.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version updates the conditional statement to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, making the function case insensitive. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
