The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing it to return incorrect results. The issue lies in the conditional statements and how the `stdout` variable is being handled. The function should check if the `stdout` contains the table name, regardless of the case. Also, the function should handle the case when `partition` is not None differently as well.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to check if the table name is present in `stdout` regardless of the case. Additionally, we need to handle the case when `partition` is not None separately.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version checks for the table name in `stdout` case-insensitively and returns the correct boolean value based on the presence of the table name. Additionally, the function now returns `True` if `stdout` is non-empty and `False` if it is empty in the case of a partition.
