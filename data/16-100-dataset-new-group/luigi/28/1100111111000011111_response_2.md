A potential error in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity correctly, leading to test failures. The function does not perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table name in the `stdout`.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not correctly handling the case insensitivity of table names in Hive. This leads to test failures when trying to check for the existence of a table with a different case. The failing test cases are associated with different combinations of table names and partition values, and the expected output in each case is not met due to the case sensitivity issue.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table name in the `stdout` received from Hive.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` in the comparison, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
