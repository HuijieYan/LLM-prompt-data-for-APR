The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` functions. 

The first issue is in the `run_hive_cmd` call inside the `else` block. The formatted string for the Hive command is not correctly interpolating the `self.partition_spec(partition)` call. This results in an invalid Hive command being executed when a partition is provided.

The second issue is the usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function. There is no explicit error handling or checking for the failure of the Hive command execution, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the command fails.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the string interpolation in the Hive command is properly formatted. Additionally, we should handle errors or unexpected output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_clause = ' and '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_clause})")
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use f-strings for string interpolation to ensure proper formatting. We also explicitly check for the presence of `stdout` to determine if the table exists, and return a boolean value accordingly. Additionally, we could add error handling for the `run_hive_cmd` function to handle any unexpected failures.
