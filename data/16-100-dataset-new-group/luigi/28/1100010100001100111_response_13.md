The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't account for case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The bug is identified from the failing test cases and the GitHub issue, which mentions that tables defined in capitalized form are returned in lower case by Hive. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison, the function will now be able to handle case insensitivity when checking for existing tables in the Hive database.
