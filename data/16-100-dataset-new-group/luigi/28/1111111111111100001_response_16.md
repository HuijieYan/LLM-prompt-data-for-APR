The issue with the `table_exists` function is that the condition to check if a table exists based on its name is incorrect, leading to the failing test cases.

Here is a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. When no partition is specified, the function should check if the table exists in the given database by querying the Hive metastore. It should return True if the table exists, and False otherwise.
2. When a partition is specified, the function should check if the table and partition exist in the given database by querying the Hive metastore. It should return True if the table and partition exist, and False otherwise.

Based on this strategy, here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2}={3})""".format(database, table, table, partition_str))
            return stdout != ""
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly check for the existence of tables with or without partitions, and the failing test cases should pass.
