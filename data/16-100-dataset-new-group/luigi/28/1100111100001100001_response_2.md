The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to the `run_hive_cmd` call not properly handling the command and parameters passed to it. It appears to be related to a query in the Hive database to check for the existence of a table or partition.

The error seems to be occurring when building the query string for the `run_hive_cmd` call in the section where it checks for a specific partition. The problem may be related to the use of `self.partition_spec(partition)`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` call is receiving the correct query and parameters. We also need to ensure that the `partition` parameter is being processed correctly to include its values in the command passed to `run_hive_cmd`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ' and '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we construct the `partition_str` by iterating over the key-value pairs of the `partition` dictionary and formatting it to match the syntax of a Hive partition filter. This ensures that the query passed to `run_hive_cmd` is correctly structured and includes the partition conditions.
