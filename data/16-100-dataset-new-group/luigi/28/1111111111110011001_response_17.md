```python
# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        # define the command to check if the table exists
        if partition is None:
            cmd = 'use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)
        else:
            cmd = """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, ' '.join([f'{key}={value}' for key, value in partition.items()]))

        # call the run_hive_cmd function with the defined command
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

        # check if the table exists based on the stdout
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
```
The buggy function fails because of incorrect construction of the command in the else block and due to missing the implementation of `run_hive_cmd` function, which is being called within the buggy function.

The corrected version first constructs the command based on the inputs and then calls the `run_hive_cmd` function with the command. It properly checks the stdout to determine if the table exists.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
