The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` to run a Hive command and determine whether a table exists in a database.

The potential error locations in the function include the conditional statements and the use of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It does not accurately determine whether a table exists based on the command output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine whether the table exists. It should also consider the case when a partition is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test. It accurately checks for the existence of a table based on the output of the Hive commands and handles the case when a partition is specified.
