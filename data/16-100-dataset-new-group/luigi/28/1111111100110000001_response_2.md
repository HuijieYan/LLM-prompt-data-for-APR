The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be in the section where it handles the case when the `partition` parameter is not `None`. The code that constructs the Hive command and runs it has a mistake, leading to incorrect results being returned, causing the tests to fail.

The bug is because the function `self.partition_spec(partition)` is used within the `stdout` string without formatting it. As a result, the command used with `run_hive_cmd` is incorrect, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we should format the result of `self.partition_spec(partition)` before using it within the `stdout` string.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_clause = ', '.join('{}="{}"'.format(key, val) for key, val in partition.items())
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_clause))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By explicitly formatting the partition clause before using it in the Hive query, we ensure that the correct command is executed, and the test will pass.
