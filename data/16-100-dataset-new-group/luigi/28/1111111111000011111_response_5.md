The bug in the `table_exists` function causes it to return incorrect results, especially for case-sensitive table names. The bug occurs because the function does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists. This is evident from the failing test cases where the table name is in uppercase and the function returns incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to modify its logic to make the table name comparison case-insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with the bug fixed:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` string are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, fixing the bug described in the failing test cases and the GitHub issues. The corrected function should now pass all the provided failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
