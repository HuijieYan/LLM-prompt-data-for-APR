To address this bug, it's important to consider the behavior of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the way the `table_exists` function handles its output. 

When the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the SQL command for checking if a table exists, it should return either the table name or an empty string. The `table_exists` function then checks if the table name is present in the output of `run_hive_cmd` to determine if the table exists.

Looking at the failing test, it's evident that the `run_hive_cmd` mock function is returning the expected output for both cases, suggesting that the issue lies in the `table_exists` function.

The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the logic to check for the presence of the table in the command output. In the cases where `run_hive_cmd` returns `OK` or `OK\nmytable`, the `table_exists` function should perform a check against these specific string outputs. Instead, it checks for the presence of the table name, regardless of the other content in the output.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to check specifically for the expected output of `run_hive_cmd` in order to correctly determine if the table exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout == 'OK'
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout != ''
```

By comparing the `stdout` with the expected command output of `run_hive_cmd`, the `table_exists` function can now accurately determine if the table exists. This change should resolve the failing test cases and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
