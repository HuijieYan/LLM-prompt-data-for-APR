The bug is causing the `table_exists` function to fail in the test. The function fails to check the existence of a table case-insensitively. This is a known issue as indicated by the GitHub issue #896. The fix is to modify the function to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The function was modified to use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table. This change should fix the bug and ensure that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected.

It is important to note that the `run_command` should also return a case-insensitive value to ensure the correct comparison. This can be handled in the `run_hive_cmd` function.
