The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class has a logic issue. The bug occurs when the function is checking for the existence of a table with a given partition. 

The bug arises from the if-else condition in the `table_exists` function. When `partition` is not None, the function constructs a command to check for the existence of a partition and returns True if the command returns any output, else it returns False. However, the bug is that it does not consider the specific partition being checked.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the if-else condition to accurately check for the existence of the specified partition within the table.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = "SHOW PARTITIONS {0}".format(table)

            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; {1}'.format(database, partition_query))

            return any(partition.items() <= self.get_partition(part) for part in stdout.split('\n'))
```

In the corrected version, we construct a query to get all the partitions for the specified table in the given database. Then, we check if the specific partition exists within the list of partitions returned from the query. If it does, we return True, else we return False.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases.
