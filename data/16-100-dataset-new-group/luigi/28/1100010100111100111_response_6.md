Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issue, it's clear that the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The issue suggests that the function `table_exists` should be case insensitive. The input table names may be presented in different cases, and the function should compare them regardless of case.

The fix proposed in the GitHub issue is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, modify the `table_exists` function as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this small change to compare the lowercased versions of the table names, the function should now correctly check for table existence in a case insensitive manner, addressing the issue reported in the failing tests and GitHub.

This should resolve the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
