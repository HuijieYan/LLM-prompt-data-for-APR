The main issue with the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, which can cause mismatches due to case differences.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the Hive output to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them for existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the root cause of the failing tests and the GitHub issues.

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case sensitivity in table name comparisons, and the failing tests should pass.
