## The corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
The potential error locations in the buggy function include not checking for case insensitivity when comparing the table name in the stdout returned by Hive.
The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name to the stdout returned by Hive. This leads to failing tests when comparing table names with different case.
To fix the bug, the corrected function `table_exists` makes use of the `.lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. Additionally, it uses the `bool()` function to simplify the return statements.
The corrected version of the function uses `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to compare the table name with the stdout in a case-insensitive manner. It also reduces the complexity of the conditional statements by directly returning the result of the comparison in the `else` block, using the `bool()` function.
With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to making `table_exists` case insensitive.
