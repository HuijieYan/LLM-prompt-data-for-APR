The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner. The bug occurs when the table name in the `table_exists` function needs to be compared in a case-insensitive manner as per the GitHub issue and failing test. This results in unexpected assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the output should be made case-insensitive. Additionally, an extra condition needs to be added to handle the case when the `stdout` is empty. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        if partition_str is None:
            return False  # Handle the case when partition_str is empty or None
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for both cases are handled. In the case where `partition` is `None`, the `stdout` and `table` are converted to lowercase using `lower()` method before comparison. In the case where `partition` is not `None`, an extra condition is added to handle the case when `partition_str` is empty or `None`, and the `stdout` is checked for a truthy value to return a boolean result.

By making these changes, the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
