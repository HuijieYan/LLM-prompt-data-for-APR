The buggy function `table_exists` has a conditional statement that checks if a `partition` parameter is provided. If it is provided, it runs a specific command using `run_hive_cmd`, and if not, it runs a different command. Both cases then return a boolean value based on the result of the command.

The bug arises from the incorrect conditional handling of the `partition` parameter. In the cases where the `partition` is not provided, the function should still execute the command using `run_hive_cmd` with the appropriate query. Currently, it only returns `stdout and table in stdout` without executing the command.

To fix the bug, the function should execute the specified Hive commands in both cases and then check the output. This can be achieved by using the subprocess module to run the hive commands and capture the output, and then evaluate the output to determine if the table or partition exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import subprocess

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            cmd = 'use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)
            stdout = subprocess.check_output(['hive', '-e', cmd]).strip().decode('utf-8')
            return table in stdout
        else:
            cmd = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            stdout = subprocess.check_output(['hive', '-e', cmd]).strip().decode('utf-8')
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `subprocess` module is used to execute the hive commands as separate processes, and their outputs are captured and processed accordingly. This ensures that the correct commands are executed based on the presence of the `partition` parameter, and the output is then evaluated to return the expected boolean result.
