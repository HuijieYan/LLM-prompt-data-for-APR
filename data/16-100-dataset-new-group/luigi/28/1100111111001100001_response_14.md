The bug in the function `table_exists` is in the `if` condition where the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with incorrect arguments. Additionally, the `return` statement is not correctly handling the presence of the table in the `stdout`. 

The bug is causing the failing test because it is not handling the different situations where the table exists or not properly. The function `table_exists` does not correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly parse the `stdout` to determine if the table exists, and the call to `run_hive_cmd` should have the correct arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)  # If stdout is not empty, the table exists in that partition
```

This corrected version of the function sets the `stdout` variable to the output obtained from running the hive commands. It then parses the `stdout` to determine if the table exists or not in the specified database and partition. By doing this, the function is now able to correctly determine if the table exists or not and should pass the failing test cases.
