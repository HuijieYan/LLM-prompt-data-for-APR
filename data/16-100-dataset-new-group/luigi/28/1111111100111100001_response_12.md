The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `stdout` value. It appears that the function is checking for the presence of the table name in the stdout, but it is not handling the difference in case sensitivity, which causes the failing tests where "mytable" and "MyTable" do not match as expected.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to handle case sensitivity when comparing the table names in the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # No need for if-else check in this case
```

By performing a case-insensitive comparison (using `.lower()`), the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests.
