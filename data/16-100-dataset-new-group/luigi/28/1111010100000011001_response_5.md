## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way it handles the `partition` parameter. The function is not utilizing the `partition` parameter properly and is always executing the block of code that checks for partitions, even if `partition` is not provided.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle the `partition` parameter. If a partition is provided, the function should show partitions for that table and partition. If no partition is provided, the function should just check for the existence of the table.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))
        return 'OK' in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition))
        return 'OK' in stdout
```
