To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when comparing tables. Based on the GitHub issue, the fix involves checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this new implementation, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this solution resolves the issue posted on GitHub by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.
