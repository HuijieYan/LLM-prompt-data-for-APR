The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns the opposite boolean value from what is expected. If the `stdout` is not empty, the function should return `True`, but it actually returns `False`, and vice versa.

The issue is likely in the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`. If `stdout` is not empty but `table` is not in `stdout`, the condition will still be true, causing the function to return `True` when it should be checking for the opposite.

To fix this bug, the condition should be `return stdout and table in stdout`, which will correctly return `True` only if both conditions are satisfied.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty, otherwise False
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases.
