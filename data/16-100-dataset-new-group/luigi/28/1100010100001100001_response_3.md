The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the logic used to determine if a table exists in the database, particularly for cases involving partitions.

The cause of the bug seems to be in the conditional checks of the function. In the first conditional check, the function checks if "stdout" is not empty, which can be problematic if there's a table with a similar name. In the second conditional check, it only checks if "stdout" exists, but it doesn't verify if the specific partition exists.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditional checks to accurately determine the existence of the table and partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```
