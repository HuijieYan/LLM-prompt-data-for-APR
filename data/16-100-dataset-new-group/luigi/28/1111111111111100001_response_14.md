The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be in the conditional statement that checks if a table exists in the database using the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue seems to be related to how the function is parsing the stdout output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and determining if the table exists based on this output.

The bug is likely causing the function to incorrectly identify whether the table exists or not, leading to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and determine if the table exists in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        if isinstance(partition, dict):
            partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            cmd = f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})"
        else:
            cmd = f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition})"

        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `partition` parameter is checked to determine if it's a dictionary containing partition key-value pairs, and the command is constructed accordingly. The `run_hive_cmd` output is then converted to a boolean value to check if any output is present.

This correction should address the issue and make the function correctly determine if the table exists in the database.

Please replace the existing `table_exists` function with the corrected version and re-run the failing test to ensure it passes.
