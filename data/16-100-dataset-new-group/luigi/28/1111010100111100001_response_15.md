The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test cases. The issue seems to be related to how the function checks for the existence of a table or partition in the Hive database. 

The bug is likely related to the conditional checks and the formatting of the Hive queries in the `table_exists` function.

In the failing test cases, the buggy function is unable to correctly determine whether the table or partition exists in the database, leading to incorrect Boolean return values.

To fix this bug, the conditional checks and the Hive queries need to be modified to correctly determine the existence of the table or partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}"'.format(database, database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} ( {2} )""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # check if stdout is not empty
    
```

The changes made to the corrected version include:
1. Modified the Hive queries to check for table or partition existence. This includes using the `SHOW TABLES` command for tables and the `SHOW PARTITIONS` command for partitions.
2. Adjusted the conditional checks to correctly handle the presence of the table or partition.
3. Included a split operation for the `stdout` in the `table_exists` function when checking for the existence of a table. This operation will correctly split the output and compare the table name.
4. Instead of comparing `stdout` to determine existence, the `bool(stdout)` expression is used to check if `stdout` is not empty.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly determine the existence of the table or partition in the Hive database and pass the failing tests.
