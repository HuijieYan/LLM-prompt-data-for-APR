There are several issues with the current implementation:
1. The check for table existence is case sensitive while the test is trying different cases.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not being properly mocked in the test cases.

To fix these issues, we can modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check for table existence and properly mock the `run_hive_cmd` function in the test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # rest of the class remains unchanged

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we are converting both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This makes the check case-insensitive as expected.

For the test cases, we need to properly mock the `run_hive_cmd` function. Here's an example of how to fix the test cases:

```python
import unittest
from unittest import mock

class TestHiveCommandClient(unittest.TestCase):
    @mock.patch("luigi.contrib.hive.run_hive_cmd")
    def test_table_exists(self, run_command):
        client = HiveCommandClient()

        run_command.return_value = "OK"
        returned = client.table_exists("mytable")
        self.assertFalse(returned)

        run_command.return_value = "OK\nmytable"
        returned = client.table_exists("mytable")
        self.assertTrue(returned)

        # Issue #896 test case insensitivity
        returned = client.table_exists("MyTable")
        self.assertTrue(returned)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
