The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a logic issue with the conditions to check for the existence of a table in a given database.

The function may return an incorrect result because in the first condition:
```python
if partition is None:
    stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    return stdout and table in stdout
```
The function checks whether the `table` is in the `stdout`, but it doesn't consider the case where the table name may exist as a substring in another table name. This can lead to false positives.

In the second condition:
```python
else:
    stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    if stdout:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
The function always returns `True` when `stdout` is not empty, regardless of the content of `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `table_exists` function should be updated to correctly determine the existence of the table.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} table {2}'.format(database, partition_query, table))
        return table in stdout.split("\n")
```
In this corrected version:
- In the first condition, `stdout` is split into lines and then checked for the exact existence of the table name.
- In the second condition, the `partition` and `table` are used to construct a show partitions query, and then the output is split into lines and checked for the exact existence of the table name.
This ensures that the presence of the table is accurately verified.
