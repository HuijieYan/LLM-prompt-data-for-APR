The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class from the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has a bug that causes it to fail the test cases. The issue seems to be related to case sensitivity, as described in the GitHub issue.

The bug occurs when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function checks for an exact match of the table name in the returned stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, Hive is case insensitive, so the table name may be returned in a different case than what was provided.

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout. We should convert both the table name and the stdout to a consistent case before comparing them.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted in GitHub related to case insensitivity.
