The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class appears to be failing due to an issue with how the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called and how its output is being checked.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the if condition that checks for `stdout` to determine if the table exists. It is also possible that the function `partition_spec` is not being called correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called with the correct arguments or is not returning the expected output. Additionally, the way the function handles the `partition_spec` method might be incorrect.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with the correct arguments and that the output is being processed correctly. Additionally, the `partition_spec` method should be called with the correct parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_string = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""
                use {0};
                show partitions {1}
                partition ({2})
            """.format(database, table, partition_string))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` function is formatted with the correct arguments and the output is checked using the `bool` function. Additionally, the `partition_spec` method has been removed as it is not necessary for the `table_exists` function.
