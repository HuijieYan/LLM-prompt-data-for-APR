The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the 'default' database. When a table name with different cases is passed, the function fails to return the correct result. This bug has been raised as an issue on GitHub with the title "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?".

The issue is described by a user who has identified that the `table_exists` function is case sensitive, which causes tests to fail when table names are capitalized differently. The suggested fix involves checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix this issue, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive check for the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions in the class)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By using the corrected version, the function will correctly check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the GitHub issue and passing the failing test.
