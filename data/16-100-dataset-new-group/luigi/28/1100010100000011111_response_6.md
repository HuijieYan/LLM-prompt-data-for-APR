The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case-insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. This causes issues when the table name case does not match with the case returned by Hive.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the stdout are converted to lower case before comparison, thereby addressing the case sensitivity issue. This modification aligns with the GitHub issue raised regarding the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
