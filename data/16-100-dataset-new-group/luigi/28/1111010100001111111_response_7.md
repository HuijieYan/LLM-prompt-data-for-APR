The buggy function, `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class, is intended to check whether a table exists in a given database and return `True` or `False` based on the result. However, the function does not handle case insensitivity, leading to test failures due to case mismatch between the input table name and the table returned by Hive. This bug has been identified and discussed in a GitHub issue, where it is suggested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The bug within the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity. When checking for an existing table, the function does not handle case differences, leading to incorrect results. The test cases provided include both cases where the table name matches exactly and where it differs in case, resulting in failures.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the test failures and aligning with the expectations stated in the GitHub issue.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will now be case insensitive, allowing it to correctly identify the existence of tables irrespective of the case of their names.
