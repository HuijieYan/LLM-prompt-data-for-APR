The bug in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class is related to case sensitivity. The `table_exists` method is performing a comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, but it doesn't handle case sensitivity properly. The issue has been reported on GitHub (issue #896) and the proposed fix is to make the comparison case insensitive.

In the failing tests, the method returns an incorrect value because it does a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command. As a result, the tests are failing when they should be passing.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the method behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the bug reported in the failing tests and GitHub.
