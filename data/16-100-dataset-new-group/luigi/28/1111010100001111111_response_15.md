Given the analysis provided, it's clear that the bug lies in the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. The issue is that the function doesn't handle case sensitivity correctly, causing tests to fail when dealing with table names that differ in capitalization. The fix for this bug is to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before doing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing.

This fix will resolve the case sensitivity issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected, satisfying the failing test cases and addressing the reported GitHub issues.
