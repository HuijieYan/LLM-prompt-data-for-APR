The issue with the current `table_exists` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when the table exists in the database. The function always returns `False` when the table does exist, and this is causing the failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly parses the output of the Hive commands and does not check for the existence of the table correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly check the output of the Hive commands and return the correct result.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version will properly parse the output of the Hive commands and return the correct result. The function will split the stdout by newline and check if the table exists in the list of tables. If the partition is provided, it will return whether the `stdout` has any content or not, effectively checking the existence of the table.

With this corrected version, the failing tests should pass, and the function will satisfy the expected input/output values.
