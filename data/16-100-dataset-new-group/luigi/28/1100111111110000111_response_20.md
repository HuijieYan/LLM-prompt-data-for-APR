The bug in the `table_exists` function of the HiveCommandClient class is that it does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This bug is related to GitHub issues #896 and #1216, where the community is discussing the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The root cause of the bug is that when checking if a table exists in the Hive database, the function does not account for the case of the table name, leading to failing assertions in the test cases provided. The failing test cases clearly show that when checking for the existence of a table, the function does not return the expected result for both capitalized and lowercase table names.

The suggested strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the text returned from the Hive command in lowercase, thus making the comparison case insensitive.

Given the explanation and bug analysis, here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This correction will ensure that when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database, the comparison is case insensitive, and it will now pass the failing test cases while also resolving the issues reported in GitHub.
