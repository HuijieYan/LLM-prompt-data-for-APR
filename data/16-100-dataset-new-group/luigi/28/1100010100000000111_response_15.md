The buggy function in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is `table_exists`. The GitHub issue related to this bug is about making the `table_exists` function case insensitive, to avoid issues with table names being returned in a different case than what was originally specified.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the comparison of the table name with the output from the hive command. 

The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the database. This causes issues when table names are returned in a different case than what was originally specified.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to be case insensitive when checking if a table exists. Specifically, we should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from the hive command to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. This change should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
