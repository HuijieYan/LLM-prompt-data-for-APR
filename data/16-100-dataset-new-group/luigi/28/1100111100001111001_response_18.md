The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way the `stdout` variable is checked before the function returns. The function should return `True` if the table exists in the database, and `False` otherwise. However, the current implementation does not handle the case when `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty string, which should also map to `False` since the table does not exist in that case.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition where `stdout` is checked and modify it to handle the case when `stdout` is an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Modify the condition to return True if stdout is not empty
```

In this corrected version, the `return` statement for the branch where `partition` is not `None` has been modified. We now use the `bool` function to explicitly convert `stdout` to a boolean value, which will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty and `False` if it is. This modification ensures that the function correctly handles the case when the table does not exist.
