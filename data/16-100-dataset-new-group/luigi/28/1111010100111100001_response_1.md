One potential issue in the `table_exists` function is that the logic doesn't properly handle the case when the table is found in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It checks for the existence of the table in the `stdout` variable, but doesn't consider if the table name is included in a list of tables.

Another issue is that when the `partition` parameter is not None, the function does not properly construct the command string for `run_hive_cmd` to check for the existence of the table with a specific partition.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic to properly check for table existence in the `stdout` variable and construct the command string in the case where a partition is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return "No such partition" not in stdout
```

With the corrected version, the function now properly checks for the existence of the table in the list of tables when `partition` is None, and constructs the correct command string to check for the existence of a table with a specific partition when `partition` is specified.
