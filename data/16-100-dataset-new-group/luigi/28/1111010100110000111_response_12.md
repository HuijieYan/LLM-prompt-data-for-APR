### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The comparison of the table name with the output from the command is case sensitive, leading to test failures.
2. The way the table name is being compared with the stdout for case sensitivity.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the case sensitivity issue in the comparison of the table name with the output from the command. This is due to Hive being case insensitive, and if the table names are in capitalized form, the comparison fails when it is compared with the lower case output from Hive.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the command needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, making the comparison case insensitive. This version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
