The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not properly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is returning the stdout directly without validating the expected format of the output.

The `table_exists` function appears to be checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. When the `partition` parameter is not provided, it runs a command to check if the table exists, and when the `partition` parameter is provided, it runs a command to check if the specified partition of the table exists.

The problem seems to be in how the function is handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and how it's deciding whether the table or partition exists based on the output.

To fix the bug, the function should disassemble the returned stdout and check for the presence of the table or partition in a structured manner. Instead of simply checking whether the stdout is non-empty, it should parse the content of stdout to determine if the table or partition exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            partition_string = ", ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})".format(database, table, partition_string))
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return bool(partitions)
```

In the corrected version, when `partition` is None, the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` is split into individual table names, and then the function checks if the target table is in the list of tables.

When `partition` is not None, the function constructs the partition string and then splits the stdout into individual partitions. It then checks if there are any partitions returned.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
