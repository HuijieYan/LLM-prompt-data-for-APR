The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test cases to produce incorrect results, as evidenced by the error messages. The function fails to account for case insensitivity when checking if a table exists, which is the source of the bug.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition
                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By using lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout for comparison, the function will correctly handle case insensitivity, thus resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
