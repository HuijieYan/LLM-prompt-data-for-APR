The bug is likely in the conditional check inside the `table_exists` function. It is currently returning the result of the conditional check, which may not be correct due to discrepancies in the input values and how they are processed. The bug is causing the incorrect evaluation of the conditional checks, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional checks and the return value to ensure that it accurately reflects the existence of the table in the database, including handling case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # other functions...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version:

1. Handles case insensitivity by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before the comparison in the first conditional check.

2. Constructs the partition condition string using the input `partition` dictionary and uses it in the second conditional check, returning `True` if the result is not empty.

This version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
