The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition to check if the `stdout` contains the table name is incorrect in the `if` statement. It should be checking for an exact match, but the current code only validates that `table` is in `stdout`. Another potential issue is the wrong usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function calls. 

To fix the bug, we will modify the conditional statements and the usage of `run_hive_cmd` to accurately check for the table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return "OK" in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return "OK" in stdout.split()
```
