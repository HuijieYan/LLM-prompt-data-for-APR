The issue with the current implementation of the `table_exists` function is that for the "MyTable" input, the function is case-sensitive and returns False instead of True. 

To fix this bug, the function needs to perform a case-insensitive check for the table name in the `stdout` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we are converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the table name is compared in a case-insensitive manner.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
