Based on the error messages and the runtime and expected values provided, it seems that the bug is related to the comparison of the table existence check. The issue might be that the function is not handling the case insensitivity as required and not comparing the table names properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the table existence check to be case insensitive and compare the table names properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparisons case insensitive and using the `lower()` method, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
