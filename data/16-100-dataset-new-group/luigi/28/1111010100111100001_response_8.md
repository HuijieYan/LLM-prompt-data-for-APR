The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly handling the checking of table existence. The issue seems to be with the condition that checks for the existence of the table in the output of the Hive command.

The buggy function seems to return `True` if the stdout is non-empty, and `False` otherwise. However, in the failing tests, we expect the function to return `True` only if the table name is found in the output, regardless of case sensitivity.

The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect comparison when checking for the existence of the table in the output. The function is returning `True` if the output is non-empty, which is incorrect. Instead, it should check if the table name is present in the output and then return `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` condition that checks for the existence of the table in the output of the Hive command. We should also consider case insensitivity when checking for the table name in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower().split("\n")
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.lower().strip() == f"{table.lower()}"
```

In this corrected version, we use the `.lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, and then perform the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and returns the correct result for the test cases provided.
