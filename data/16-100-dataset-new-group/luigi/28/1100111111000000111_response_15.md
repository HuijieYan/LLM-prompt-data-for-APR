The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file is failing because it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This issue was reported on GitHub under the title "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".

The problem lies in the comparison of the table name and the output from Hive, which is case sensitive. As a result, even if the table exists in Hive, if the case of the table name does not match the case in the Hive output, the function incorrectly reports that the table does not exist.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to perform case-insensitive comparisons between the table name and the output from Hive. We can convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With the above change, the `table_exists` function should now accurately determine the existence of a table in Hive regardless of the case of the table name and the case of the Hive output. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
