The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the condition for checking for the existence of a table with a partition properly. The `table_exists` function fails to check whether the stdout contains the table name when a partition is specified.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to properly handle the condition for checking the existence of a table with a partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simplified the logic to directly return the boolean value of stdout
```

By simplifying the `if stdout:` condition, we ensure that the function will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, and `False` otherwise, effectively handling the partitioned table case properly.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
