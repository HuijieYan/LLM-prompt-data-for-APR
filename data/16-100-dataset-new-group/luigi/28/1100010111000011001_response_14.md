The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being used to check for the existence of a table. The function returns the stdout response from the `run_hive_cmd` and checks if the table name is in the output for the first two cases. However, for the third and fourth test cases, it is checking for the existence of a partition instead of a table.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` for both table and partition existence checks.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

Explanation of the changes:
1. In the first case, the `show tables` command is used instead of `show tables like` to get a list of tables in the database. The returned stdout is split into a list of table names, and then checked if the given table exists in that list.
2. In the second case, the `show partitions` command is used to check if the given partition exists for the table. The returned stdout is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, and then checked if it is not an empty string.

These changes will allow the `table_exists` function to correctly handle both table and partition existence checks.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
