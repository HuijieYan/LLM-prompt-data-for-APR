The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database and logs a warning message if it doesn't. The bug issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive to handle cases where tables are defined with capitalized names.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the `if` and `else` conditions, where the comparison of table names with the result from `run_hive_cmd` is being performed.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity, which is causing the failing test and the reported issue on GitHub.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the result from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before doing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version checks for the table name in the output of `run_hive_cmd` using a case-insensitive approach. This will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive as required.
