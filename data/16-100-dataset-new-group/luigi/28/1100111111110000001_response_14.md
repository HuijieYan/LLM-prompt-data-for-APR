The buggy function `table_exists` seems to be failing when the table name is not found in the `stdout` returned by the `run_hive_cmd`. To fix this, we need to ensure that the condition for checking the presence of the table in the `stdout` is correctly implemented.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly checks for the presence of the table in the `stdout`. It uses the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` which will result in False when the `stdout` is not an empty string and the table name is not found in it. This is leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should check for the existence of the table in the `stdout` using the `in` operator without the `and` condition.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                             (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

The correction is made on lines 11 and 18, specifically removing the `return stdout and` condition and using the `in` and `bool` operators appropriately.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
