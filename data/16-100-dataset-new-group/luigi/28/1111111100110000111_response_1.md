Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with other functions, classes, and the GitHub issue, we can see that the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly. The issue reported on GitHub confirms that this function is not case insensitive, causing tests to fail when checking for table existence using different casings.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the comparison of the table name in the stdout with the provided table name, which is not case insensitive.

The cause of the bug is related to the comparison between the table name and the content of the stdout, which is not being done in a case insensitive manner. This causes the test cases to fail when checking for table existence using different casings.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name with the content of the stdout in a case insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the content of the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout content to lowercase before comparing them, the corrected `table_exists` function will now handle case sensitivity correctly and pass the failing test cases. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
