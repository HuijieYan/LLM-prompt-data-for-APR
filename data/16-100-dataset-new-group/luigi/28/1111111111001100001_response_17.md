The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being properly mocked in the test cases, and therefore returning incorrect values in the test scenario.

To fix this bug:
- Use the `@mock.patch` decorator to properly mock the `run_hive_cmd` function in the test code to ensure that the correct return values are provided in each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))

            if stdout and self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With the updated `table_exists` function and appropriate mocking of the `run_hive_cmd` function in the test cases, the function should now pass the failing tests.
