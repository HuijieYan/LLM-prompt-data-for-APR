The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the 'show tables like' command and the 'show partitions' command in Hive. The current implementation of the table_exists function only checks that stdout is not empty, which leads to incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to properly handle the output of the 'show tables like' and 'show partitions' commands in Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} ("{2}")'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We use the 'show tables in' command to properly check for the existence of the table in the specified database.
- We split the stdout by '\n' and check if the table exists in the list of tables.
- We also fix the 'show partitions' command to be properly formatted and return a bool value based on the existence of partitions.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
