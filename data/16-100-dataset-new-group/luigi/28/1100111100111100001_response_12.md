The bug seems to be caused by the `table_exists` function not handling the case insensitivity of the `table` input parameter correctly, which leads to failing tests.

The 'table_exists' function is called with the table name as "mytable" and then again with "MyTable". The first test returns False while it should return True, and the second test returns True while it should return False. This indicates that the function is not handling the case insensitivity correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the names of the tables is not case sensitive. One way to do this is to convert both the table name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` input and the contents of the `stdout` variable are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before making the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is not case sensitive and should fix the failing tests.
