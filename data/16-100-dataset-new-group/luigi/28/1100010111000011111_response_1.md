The bug in the `table_exists` function of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This bug was reported in GitHub issue #896, where it was suggested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the function directly checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering the case of the table name. This leads to failing tests when tables are defined with different cases than what is expected in the code.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to check the lowercased table name against the lowercased stdout to handle case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive check for the presence of the table name in the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function, as suggested in the GitHub issue. The function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
