## Fixing the bug
The bug is caused by a case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class. The standard practice in Hive is case insensitivity, but the function is currently comparing table names in a case-sensitive manner, leading to test failures. The issue has been reported on GitHub and suggests that the `table_exists` function should be made case-insensitive.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner. We can use the `lower()` function to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lower case before comparing them.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # compare in a case-insensitive manner
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # use bool() to check if stdout is empty
```

The corrected version of the function uses the `lower()` function to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lower case before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, as suggested in the GitHub issue. Additionally, the comparison is done using `in` to check if the table name exists in the output.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
