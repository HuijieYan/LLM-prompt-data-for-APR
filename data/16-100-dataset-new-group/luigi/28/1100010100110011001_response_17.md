```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
The buggy function has a few issues:
1. In the first if statement, the `show tables like` command should be replaced with `show tables` to correctly match the table names.
2. In the else statement, the `show partitions` command is incorrectly formatted and missing the correct syntax.

To fix these issues, the corrected function uses the correct syntax for the `show tables` and `show partitions` commands. It also returns a boolean directly instead of using an if-else construct.

The corrected function is provided above. It should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
