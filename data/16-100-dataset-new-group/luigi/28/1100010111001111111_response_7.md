The bug in the function `table_exists` is that it does not perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command, leading to test failures when the capitalization of the table name does not match the output from Hive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # This line ensures that stdout is not empty
```

With this correction, the function will perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
