## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The issue described in the GitHub post is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The problem arises when the table is defined using capitalized letters, but Hive returns the name in lowercase. The solution is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

In the corrected function, the comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` ensures that the table name is found in the stdout regardless of the case used in the table name.

By implementing this fix, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence in Hive.
