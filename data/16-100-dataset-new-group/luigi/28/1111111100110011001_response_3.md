The bug in the given function `table_exists` occurs due to the incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It appears that the function is not being called properly, which leads to incorrect return values.

The bug is causing the failing test to return an AssertionError because the expected values of the `table_exists` function are not matching with the actual return values.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be properly called with the correct parameters. Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of the table should be revised.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition))
            return stdout and len(stdout.splitlines()) > 0
```

In the corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` function is properly called with the required parameters. Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of the table is improved.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
