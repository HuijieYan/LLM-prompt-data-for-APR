The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database and partition. However, it has a bug where it doesn't handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly, leading to failing test cases.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional check of the `stdout` variable after running the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't, but the conditional checks are not handling the outputs properly.

The cause of the bug is due to the mishandling of the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should return `True` if the table exists in the specified database and partition, but it is not handling the output correctly, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` output is processed correctly to determine if the table exists. Specifically, we need to handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function based on the table's presence in the database and partition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""
```

In this corrected version, the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function is split based on the newline character, and then the table's presence is checked. If the table exists, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This ensures that the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly, fixing the bug.
