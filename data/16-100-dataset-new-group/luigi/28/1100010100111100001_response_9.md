In the provided code, the bug appears to be in the conditional checks for the presence of the table. It seems that the implementation does not account for case-insensitivity.

The bug occurs when the table_exists function checks if the table exists using the "show tables" hive command and a conditional statement to return the result. When run_command returns "OK\nmytable", it should return True. However, it does not account for case-insensitivity, and the test fails.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lower case before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons and pass the failing tests.
