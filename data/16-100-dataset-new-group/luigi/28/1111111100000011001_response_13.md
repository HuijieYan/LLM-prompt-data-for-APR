The buggy function has a few potential error locations:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function may not be returning the expected output, causing issues with the `stdout` variable.
2. The `partition_spec` function may not be returning the expected output when called within the `table_exists` function for the `else` case.

The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command and then checks the output to determine if the table exists. If a `partition` is provided, it also uses the `partition_spec` function to construct a command to check if the specific partition exists.

The bug may be caused by incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function or incorrect construction of the command to check for the existence of a specific partition.

To fix the bug:
1. Verify that the `run_hive_cmd` function is returning the expected output. If not, debug and fix that function.
2. Ensure that the `partition_spec` function is properly constructing the command to check for the existence of a specific partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_command = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_command})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with correct parameters and that the `partition_spec` function is used to construct the partition command properly. The function now returns a boolean value directly based on the `stdout` instead of explicitly returning `True` or `False`.
