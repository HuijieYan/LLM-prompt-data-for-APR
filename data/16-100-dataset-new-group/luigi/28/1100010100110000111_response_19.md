## The cause of the bug

The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case insensitivity for table names properly. This is evident from the failing tests and the GitHub issue. The function does not check for case insensitivity, causing the tests to fail when checking for table existence with differently capitalized names.

The fix suggested in the GitHub issue is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

## A strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table, resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.
