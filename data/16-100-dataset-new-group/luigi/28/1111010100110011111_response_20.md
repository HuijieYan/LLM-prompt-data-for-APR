The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class from the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has two main issues:
1. Inconsistent case sensitivity: The function does not handle case insensitivity properly, leading to failing test cases where the case of the table name is different from the case in the stdout.
2. Inconsistent outputs: The function does not return the expected values for the given inputs in the failing test cases.

The GitHub issue #896 highlights the problem, suggesting that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive, and the fix should involve checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the function to compare both `stdout` and the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison. Additionally, the function should be modified to return the correct values according to the expected results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between `stdout` and the table name is done in a case-insensitive manner using the `lower()` method. Additionally, the function returns the expected boolean values based on the existence of the table in the given database. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
