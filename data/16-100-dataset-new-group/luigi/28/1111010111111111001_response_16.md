The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the condition checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database and the handling of the `stdout` variable. It appears that the condition is not correctly evaluating whether the table exists in some cases. Additionally, the logic for checking partitioned tables seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to properly handle both unpartitioned and partitioned tables in the Hive database.

Based on the analysis, I suggest the following corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
        return self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
```

In this corrected version, we split the `stdout` by newline character before checking if the table/partition exists. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
