The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely in the conditional statements that check the presence of the table in stdout. The issue may be with the comparison operators or the condition itself. 

The function should return `True` when the table exists, and `False` when it doesn't. However, the comparison of `table in stdout` might not be functioning as intended. Additionally, the condition `if stdout:` should be evaluated as `True` as long as `stdout` is not empty, irrespective of the content. 

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to properly check the values in `stdout` and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions remain the same

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
