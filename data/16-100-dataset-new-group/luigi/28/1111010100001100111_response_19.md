Considering the analysis, the buggy function `table_exists` of the `HiveCommandClient` class fails to handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database.

The function fails to account for case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database, causing tests to fail when running case insensitive checks. The problem arises mainly from the comparison of the table name and the stdout, which returns tables' names as lower case regardless of the case used in the original table name. 

A suitable strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditional statements to include case insensitivity checks. Specifically, it can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase or upper case before comparison. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `.lower()` method, ensuring a case-insensitive check for the table's existence.

This updated version correctly addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and fixes the bug by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence in a Hive database.
