The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. This causes the test cases to fail when checking for table existence with different case scenarios.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command to be case insensitive. We can do this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})"
            )

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function now compares the lowercase version of the table name and the stdout from the Hive command, thus making the comparison case insensitive.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding case insensitivity in table existence checks.
