The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity. The `table` parameter used to check the existence of the table in the `stdout` is not being compared in a case-insensitive manner. This leads to failing tests when the case of the table name does not match the case of the table name returned in `stdout` from the Hive command.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to ensure it is case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lower case before the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function now compares both the table name and the `stdout` in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post. The function should now return the expected results for all the provided test cases.
