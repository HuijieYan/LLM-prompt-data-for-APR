The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the handling of the `stdout` variable. It is expected to contain the result of running hive commands, and the function is supposed to return True if the table exists based on the stdout, and False otherwise. However, it appears that the function is incorrectly processing the stdout in some cases, leading to incorrect return values.

Based on the failing tests and their expected results, it seems that the function should return True if the table exists in the database, and False otherwise. The current implementation, which checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout, is not considering all possible cases.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the stdout in all cases and return the correct result based on the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the function uses the `split` method to split the `stdout` by newline characters, and then checks if the table name is present in the list of tables obtained from the `stdout`. For the partition case, it simply checks for the existence of `stdout`.

These changes should ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table and returns the expected results for all input cases.
