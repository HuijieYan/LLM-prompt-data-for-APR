The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive, which leads to test failures in the case of differently cased table names.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner by converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # The check for existence can be simplified

```

With this change, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive check for the table name in the Hive output, resolving the issue observed in the failing test cases. This correction is aligned with the GitHub issues raised to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

By making these changes, the failing test cases for the `table_exists` function, as shown in the GitHub issues, should pass successfully.
