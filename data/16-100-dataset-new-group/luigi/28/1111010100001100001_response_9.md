The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the conditional check for the existence of the table or partition is not being handled correctly. The function is returning `stdout and table in stdout` which may not always correctly identify the presence of the table. Similarly, the `show partitions` command is not being handled correctly in the second part of the function.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check for the existence of the table or partition more accurately and return a boolean value accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition ({3});'.format(database, database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we split the `stdout` by newlines and check for the presence of the table in the list of tables returned. For the partition case, we use the `partition_spec` and check if `stdout` has any content to determine the existence of the partition.

This should address the bug and provide accurate results for the existence of tables and partitions.
