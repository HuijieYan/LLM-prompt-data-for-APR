Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the table name in the "table_exists" function is case-sensitive and does not take into account the case insensitivity of Hive.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the comparison in the "table_exists" function. The function does not handle the case-insensitivity of Hive, leading to failures when checking for existing tables.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive needs to be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        if stdout:
            return table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is made case-insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison. This resolves the issue of table names being returned in lowercase from Hive and failing the comparison in the original function.
