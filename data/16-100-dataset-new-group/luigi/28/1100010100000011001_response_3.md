The bug in the provided function seems to be related to how the `run_hive_cmd` function is being used to check for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements that check the value of `stdout` after running the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists or not. It seems to be checking for the presence of the table name within the output instead of checking for a specific return value that indicates the table's existence.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists or not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return 'OK' in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return 'OK' in stdout.split()
```
In this corrected version of the function, the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is split into a list of strings, and then we check if the string `'OK'` is present in that list. This change allows us to accurately determine if the table exists in the database.

This corrected version of the function should satisfy all the expected input/output values and types for the provided test cases.
