The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it is case-sensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This results in a failure to find tables with capitalized names when the function is called with a table name in lowercase.

The issue is documented in a GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and its related "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The issue identifies that the function should be case-insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence in the Hive database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # existing functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, then perform a case-insensitive comparison to check for table existence.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly identify the existence of tables in the Hive database, regardless of the case of the table name.
