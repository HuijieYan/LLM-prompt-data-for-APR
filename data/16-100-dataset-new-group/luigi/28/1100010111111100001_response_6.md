The potential error in the `table_exists` function is the logic used to determine if a table exists in the database. The function is not correctly handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The bug is causing the test cases to fail because the function is not returning the expected results based on the given inputs.

To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if the table exists. Additionally, we need to handle the case insensitivity for table names.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    if stdout:
        if partition is None:
            return table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected version of the function handles both cases where the `partition` is None and where it is not. It also handles case insensitivity for table names. This should make the function pass the failing tests.
