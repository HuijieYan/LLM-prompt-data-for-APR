The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test due to a case sensitivity issue, as indicated by the GitHub issue. The function does not account for case insensitivity when checking for table existence. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the hive command, leading to case mismatches and failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase or uppercase before comparing them. This will ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will perform a case-insensitive check for table existence, resolving the failing tests and addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
