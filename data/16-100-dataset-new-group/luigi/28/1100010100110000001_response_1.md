The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing tests with the error message `AssertionError: False is not true`. The bug is occurring because the function is not correctly handling the Hive command output.

The bug is in the section of the function where the `stdout` is being checked and returned based on the presence of the table in the output. The function is returning `True` only when the `stdout` is not empty, but it should be specifically checking if the table exists in the `stdout` for the correct result.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to check if the table exists in the `stdout` and return `True` if it does and `False` if it does not. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout
```

With this corrected version, the function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` directly and returns `True` if it is, and `False` if it is not. This should fix the bug and make the tests pass.
