To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. We will convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue reported on GitHub by making the comparison between the table name and `stdout` case insensitive. The `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` line ensures that both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` are compared after converting them to lowercase.

By using this approach, we can ensure that the `table_exists` function works correctly for table names with different casing, and the failing test cases should pass successfully.
