The buggy function is the `table_exists` function, which is supposed to determine if a table exists based on the input parameters. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for table existence.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional statements and the assignment of the `stdout` variable.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the `stdout` variable correctly when checking for the existence of a table or partition in the Hive database.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements need to be modified to properly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the correct boolean value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `stdout` variable is split into a list of table names, and the `in` operator is used to check for table existence. Additionally, the `bool` function is used to convert the `stdout` variable to a boolean value for checking partition existence. These changes should ensure that the function returns the correct boolean value for table and partition existence.
