The bug is likely in the way the stdout is being checked in the `table_exists` function. The first case is failing because the function expects the `stdout` to be equal to `'OK'` and to check if the `table` is in `stdout`. The second case is failing because the function expects the `stdout` to be equal to `'OK\nmytable'` and to check if the `table` is in `stdout`. The third and fourth cases are failing because the function demonstrates insensitivity in table case. 

It appears that the problem might be with the way the `stdout` is being handled in the function. The function is expecting `stdout` to be in a certain format, and when it doesn't match, it returns the wrong output.

An appropriate strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the logic for parsing and checking for the existence of the table in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # other functions

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, ','.join(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected function now correctly handles the `stdout` by splitting it and checking for the existence of the table in the output. This should address the issues with the failing test cases.
