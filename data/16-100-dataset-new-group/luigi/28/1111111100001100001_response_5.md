The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way the `stdout` variable is being checked for a specific condition. The function should return `True` if the table exists, but it is currently returning `stdout and table in stdout`, which is not the expected behavior.

One potential source of the bug is that the `stdout` variable is not being properly handled after running the `run_hive_cmd` function. If the table exists, the `stdout` variable will contain the table name, and if it doesn't exist, `stdout` will be empty.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check if `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the table exists. The fixed version of the function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

This fix should cover all the edge cases mentioned and address the issue with the function returning incorrect values.
