## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The bug in the original function is that it does not consider case sensitivity when checking the table's existence in the database. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names have different cases.

The corrected version of the function fixes the bug by converting both the table name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

The corrected function should satisfy all the given test cases and pass the failing tests, as well as resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
