The issue with the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `table` parameter with the `stdout` variable. 

The function is expected to return `True` if the table exists, based on whether the `stdout` contains the table name. However, in the failing test cases, it seems that the comparison is not functioning as expected. When `table` is in mixed case, the comparison fails, resulting in the function returning `False` instead of `True`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the comparison to be case-insensitive, so that it can handle different cases of the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, allowing the function to correctly identify if the table exists in the database.
