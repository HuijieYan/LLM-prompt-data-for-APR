The buggy function is the `table_exists` method within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` file. The issue arises when checking whether a table exists, as the implementation is case-sensitive, which causes the test cases to fail.

The buggy function has an issue where it checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database using case-sensitive comparisons. This leads to failures when the table name in the database differs in case from the one being checked. The bug has been identified in the failing test cases where the table names are compared for existence, and the issue has been described in the GitHub issues #896 and a discussion thread.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the stdout to a consistent case, such as lowercase, before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
    
    if stdout:
        existing_tables = stdout.split()
        return table.lower() in map(str.lower, existing_tables)
    else:
        return False
```

In the corrected version, the `table` argument and the `existing_tables` are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison. This change addresses the issue and ensures that the function passes the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
