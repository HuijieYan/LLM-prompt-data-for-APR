The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing the test to fail when it should pass. The function compares the table name with the output from Hive, which is not taking into account the case sensitivity of table names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by comparing the table name with the output from Hive after converting both to lowercase.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions in the class remain unchanged

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is now case insensitive and should pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
