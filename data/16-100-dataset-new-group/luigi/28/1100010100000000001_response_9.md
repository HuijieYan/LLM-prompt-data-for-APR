## Corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Analysis:
The buggy function is checking whether a table exists in a given database in Hive. The function has two main parts: one for when partition is None, and the other for when partition is not None. There are several potential error locations in the function, including:
1. The SQL queries being used to check for table existence and partitions are not correct.
2. The string formatting being used might not be taking the correct values.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect SQL queries and string formatting. The original function is not constructing the correct SQL queries to check for table existence and partitions in Hive.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the SQL queries used to check for table existence and partitions, as well as ensuring that the string formatting uses the correct values.

Explanation of the corrected version:
In the corrected version of the function, the SQL queries have been updated to use the correct syntax for checking table existence and partitions in Hive. Additionally, the string formatting has been updated to use the correct values for the database, table, and partition. This should ensure that the function correctly checks for table existence and partitions in Hive.
