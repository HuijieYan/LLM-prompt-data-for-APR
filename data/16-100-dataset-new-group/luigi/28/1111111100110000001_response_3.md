The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect usage of run_hive_cmd() and an error in string formatting that causes wrong parameters to be passed.

The buggy function 'table_exists' first attempts to identify whether a table 'mytable' exists in the specified database. In doing so, it checks the returned output of the run_hive_cmd command and confirms if the table name is present in the output.

However, the formatting used for building the Hive command in the else block is incorrect. The use `%s; show partitions %s partition (%s)` format string is used to build the query, and the `self.partition_spec(partition)` method is provided as the argument for `%s`. This does not format as expected, resulting in an incorrect query.

To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the format string and ensure that correct Hive commands are generated in both the if and else conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the 'table_exists' function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            # Correct the formatting of the hive command
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, ",".join(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. The Hive command used in the else block is correctly formatted using string formatting with placeholders. The partition values are joined using `",".join(partition)` to correctly pass them to the `show partitions` command.
2. The final return statement uses `bool(stdout)` to directly return the boolean value based on whether stdout has a value regardless of its content.

With these changes, the corrected 'table_exists' function should now pass the failing test cases.
