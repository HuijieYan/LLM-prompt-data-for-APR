The issue is with the logic in the `table_exists` function. In the first part, it checks if the table exists by using a `show tables` command, and in the second part, it checks if the table exists with a specific partition using a `show partitions` command. The logic is incorrect, leading to inconsistent results, and the function is not properly handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to correctly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and to use the correct conditional checks to determine if the table exists. 

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_query))
            return stdout.strip() != ''
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function correctly handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, and the conditional checks for table existence have been fixed. Now, the function will correctly determine if the table exists with or without a partition.
