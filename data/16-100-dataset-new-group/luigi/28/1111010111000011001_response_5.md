## Fixing the buggy function

### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not correctly handle the partition parameter. It also has an issue with string formatting using `%s`.

### Identifying potential error locations
The buggy function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for table existence. However, the logic for checking the existence of tables with partitions is incorrect.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the function causes it to incorrectly handle the table existence check for partitions. It does not properly construct the Hive command for checking partition existence, causing it to always return false when a partition is specified.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should construct the Hive command properly for both regular table existence checks and checks with partitions. It should also handle the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table/partition exists or not.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            partition_command = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}({2});".format(database, table, partition_command))
            return bool(stdout)
```
