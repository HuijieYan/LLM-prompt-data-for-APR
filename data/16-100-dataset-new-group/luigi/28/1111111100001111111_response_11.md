The behavior of the buggy `table_exists` function appears to be causing issues when checking for table existence in Hive, as indicated by a GitHub issue regarding case insensitivity when checking for table existence. The function is expected to return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise. However, discrepancies in case sensitivity are causing the tests to fail.

The cause of the bug stems from the comparison between the table name and the table name obtained from the `stdout` response. The issue can be resolved by converting both table names to either uppercase or lowercase for comparison.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to ensure that the provided table name is compared in a case-insensitive manner with the `stdout` response from the Hive command.

Given the analysis and suggested strategy, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the `stdout` response are converted to lowercase for comparison, resolving the case insensitivity issue and ensuring consistent behavior. This updated implementation aligns with the expected input/output values and addresses the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity when checking for table existence.
