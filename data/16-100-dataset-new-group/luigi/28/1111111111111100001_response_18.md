The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the returned `stdout`. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the case where the table name appears within a larger string in the `stdout`. This is evident in the failing test cases where the function returns incorrect results.

The bug is likely to be in the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` string, as well as in the parsing of `partition_spec` when it is not `None`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` to ensure that it accurately identifies the table name. Additionally, we need to check the `partition` parameter and use the correct `partition_spec` when building the command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            if isinstance(partition, dict):
                partition_str = ", ".join("{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items())
            else:
                partition_str = partition
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")
            return bool(stdout)
```
