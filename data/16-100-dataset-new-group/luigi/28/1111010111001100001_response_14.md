The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the logic for checking if a table exists is incorrect. The function is returning the opposite boolean value of what is expected. Additionally, the function performs a check for table existence without considering the partition specified.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for checking table existence and also include the partition check when it is passed as an argument.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".
                            format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version checks for the existence of the table and considers the partition when it is provided. With this corrected logic, the function should pass the failing tests.
