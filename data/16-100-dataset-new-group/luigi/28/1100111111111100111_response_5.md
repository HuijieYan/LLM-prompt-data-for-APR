To fix the bug, we need to implement case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This will address the issues reported in GitHub related to case insensitivity and table names being returned in lowercase by Hive.

Right now, the buggy function does not handle the case insensitivity of table names. We will need to modify the buggy function, `table_exists`, to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The correction involves converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison for table existence is case insensitive, as required.
