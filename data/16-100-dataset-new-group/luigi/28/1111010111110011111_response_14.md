The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class have a bug which causes it to fail the test cases and does not match the expected input/output values.

Analysis:
- The bug is in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`.
- The failing test `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` with error messages indicate that the function does not return the expected values in various scenarios.
- The GitHub issue indicates that the `table_exists` method should be case insensitive, but the current implementation is not.

The cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs because the `table_exists` method does not perform a case insensitive comparison, causing the test cases to fail.
- The function is supposed to use `lower()` on table names to perform case-insensitive matching, but the current implementation does not do that.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the `table_exists` method to use `lower()` on table names and standardize the comparison for case insensitivity.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` method:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
