## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()   # Make the comparison case insensitive
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout and self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is related to case sensitivity when checking for existing tables. The issue arises because Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lowercase, so the function should account for this when comparing table names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to perform a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method.

After making this adjustment, the function will pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix also resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding the case sensitivity of table names.
