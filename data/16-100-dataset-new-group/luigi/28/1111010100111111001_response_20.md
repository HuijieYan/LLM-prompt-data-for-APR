The issue in the buggy function is with the comparison of the `stdout` value to determine if a table exists. In the first case, the `stdout` value doesn't contain the table name, causing the comparison to return False when it should return True. In the second case, the table name is present in the `stdout` value, but the comparison is case-sensitive, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle case-insensitive comparisons and to correctly check for the existence of the table in the `stdout` value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison. We directly return the evaluation of `stdout` for the second case, as the existence of `stdout` is sufficient to determine the table's existence.

With this correction, the function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
