The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the `stdout` variable's value not being properly checked for the table name, leading to incorrect return values in some cases.

The first case shows that the function returns False when it should return True, as "mytable" is present in the `stdout` value.

The second case is similar to the first one, where the case of the table name is different, but it should still return True.

The third and sixth cases include a partition parameter, and the `stdout` value is a list of partitions. This is probably where the bug lies, as the function does not correctly handle partitioned tables.

To fix the bug, the function should properly parse and check the `stdout` value when a partition is present. Additionally, the function should be case-insensitive when checking for table existence, as shown in the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partitions))
        return any(table.lower() == line.strip().split('=')[1] for line in stdout.splitlines())
```
