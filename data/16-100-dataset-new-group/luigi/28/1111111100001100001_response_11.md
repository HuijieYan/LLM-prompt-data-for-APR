The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without being referenced to the appropriate class `HiveCommandClient`. This results in the function being called in the wrong context, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be referenced correctly by using the `self` keyword to call it within the `HiveCommandClient` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
