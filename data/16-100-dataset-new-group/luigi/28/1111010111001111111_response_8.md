The buggy function `table_exists` is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists, causing the failing test cases. This was brought up as a GitHub issue #896 and was identified to be a part of the problem.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be altered to make the table name case insensitive when comparing it with the table names returned by Hive.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` for comparison, the bug is fixed and the expected behavior for checking if a table exists in Hive is restored. This corrected version should address the failing test cases and resolve GitHub issue #896.
