The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the conditional check on the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists. It appears that the logic for checking the existence of the table is flawed, as it only checks if the table name is present in the output, which is not sufficient.

A potential fix for this bug is to modify the conditional check to consider the content of the `stdout` variable more accurately, ensuring that the table name is correctly matched and not just present in the output. Additionally, the conditional check for the partitioned tables also needs to be updated to account for the content of the `stdout` variable more effectively.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        command = f"use {database}; show partitions {table}"
        partition_str = " and ".join([f"{k} = '{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        command = f"{command} partition({partition_str})"
        
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(command)
        
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In the updated function, we use the `strip` method to remove any leading/trailing whitespace from the `stdout` variable to ensure accurate comparison. Additionally, we construct the `command` string for partitioned tables by including the partition specification based on the input, and then use this command to check for the existence of the table.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
