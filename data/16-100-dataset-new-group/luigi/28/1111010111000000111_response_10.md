# The cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the lack of case insensitivity in the table_exists function of the HiveCommandClient class. Tables in Hive are case insensitive, meaning that the function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

# Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

# Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected version, the comparison is made case-insensitive by using the lower() method to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase. This ensures that the table_exists function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.
