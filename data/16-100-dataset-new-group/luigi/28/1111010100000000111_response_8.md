## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue
The buggy function `table_exists` is a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a part of the `luigi` library. The GitHub issue indicates that the `table_exists` method should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the function lies in the comparison of the `table` name with the output of the Hive command. The function does not handle case sensitivity properly.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the GitHub Issue information
The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` method directly compares the provided `table` name with the output of the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This results in a failure when the table names have different cases.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` method to convert both the `table` name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
