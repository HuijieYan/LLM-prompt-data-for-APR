The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity. The function checks for the existence of a table in Hive, but the comparison between the input table name and the names of existing tables is case sensitive. This causes the function to fail when the case of the table name doesn't match exactly with the names of existing tables in Hive, resulting in false negatives.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the input table name and the names of existing tables in Hive needs to be made case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the input table name and the names of existing tables to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison.

This fix will address the issue reported on GitHub and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, allowing it to accurately determine the existence of a table in Hive.
