The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function is not accounting for the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive database, which causes the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to convert the table name to lowercase before checking its existence in the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
