The current buggy function fails to return the expected values. The issue seems to be with the conditions that check for the existence of a table or a partition in the Hive database.

Upon analysis, it appears that the condition `if stdout` is used to check for the presence of a table or a partition. This condition will evaluate to `True` even if the `stdout` string is not empty, regardless of the actual table or partition existence.

To fix the bug, the function should specifically check for the presence of the table or partition in the `stdout` string, rather than relying on the truthiness of the string itself.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simply return the result of the condition check
```

In the corrected function, for the first condition, it checks if the `table` is in the list of tables obtained from `stdout` by splitting the string at the newline character (`\n`).

For the second condition, it simply returns the result of the `bool(stdout)` check, which is equivalent to checking if `stdout` is non-empty and returns `True` if it is, and `False` if it is empty.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and return the expected values.
