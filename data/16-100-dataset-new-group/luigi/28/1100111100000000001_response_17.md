The bug in the given function `table_exists` is that it calls the `partition_spec` method without initializing the `HiveCommandClient` class. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, we need to instantiate the `HiveCommandClient` class and then call the `partition_spec` method. Then, use the instantiated client to run the hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            client = HiveCommandClient()  # Instantiate the HiveCommandClient
            spec = client.partition_spec(partition)  # Call partition_spec using the instantiated client
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, spec))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, we create an instance of the `HiveCommandClient` using `client = HiveCommandClient()` and then invoke the `partition_spec` method using `client.partition_spec(partition)`.

This will ensure that the `partition_spec` method is called on an instance of `HiveCommandClient` and fix the bug in the original function.
