The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes the tests to fail when the table names have different cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to make both the table name and the stdout lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

With this change, the function will pass the failing tests, and it satisfies the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
