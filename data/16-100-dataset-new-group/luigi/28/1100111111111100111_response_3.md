The buggy function table_exists is failing because it does not handle case insensitivity. The test is failing because the table_exists function is not returning the expected result when checking for the existence of a table with different case variations. This was also identified in the GitHub issue #896.

To fix this bug, the table_exists function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the failing tests.

Here is the corrected version of the table_exists function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this version, both the table and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the lower() method before performing the comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will fix the failing tests and the issue reported in GitHub.
