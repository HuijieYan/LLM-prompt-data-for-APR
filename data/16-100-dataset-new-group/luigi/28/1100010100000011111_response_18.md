The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive. This issue has been reported on GitHub, and a proposed solution is to check stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. We can accomplish this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout, making it case insensitive as requested in the GitHub issue. This solution satisfies all the expected input/output values and resolves the case sensitivity issue reported on GitHub.
