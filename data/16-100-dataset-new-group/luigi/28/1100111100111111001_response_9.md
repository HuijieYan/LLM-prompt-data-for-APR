The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional statement for checking if the table exists when a partition is not provided. The function fails to handle the case where the table name is in the output but the output contains other text as well.

To fix this bug, we should modify the if condition to check if the table name is a separate word in the output. We can achieve this by searching for the table name with word boundaries.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(t == table for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version uses the `split()` method to separate the lines in the output and then checks if the table is in the list of tables. This ensures that any extra text in the output will not cause the function to return an incorrect value.
