The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is not handling the case where `table` is a substring of `stdout` rather than an exact match. Additionally, the condition `if stdout:` is always evaluating to True because the `run_hive_cmd` function returns a non-empty string, causing the function to always return True.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check for exact matches and handle the case where `run_hive_cmd` returns a non-empty string regardless of whether the table exists or not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
```

This new version splits the `stdout` string by newline characters and then checks for an exact match with the table name in the list of table names.

This corrected version should address the bugs and pass all the failing tests.
