The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to incorrect comparison of the stdout variable. The function is checking if `stdout` contains any value, but it should specifically check for the table name.

The corrected version of the function would be:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ''
```

This corrected function will return `False` only if the stdout is empty.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests. This fix should resolve the bug in the `table_exists` function.
