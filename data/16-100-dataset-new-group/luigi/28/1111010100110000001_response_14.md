The buggy function `table_exists` within the class `HiveCommandClient` is not returning the expected results. The implementation of the `table_exists` function is using a conditional statement to check if a given table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, the implementation is returning incorrect results, leading to failing test cases and assertion errors.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional statements that check the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The logic seems to be flawed, as it's not correctly handling the condition for checking whether a table exists in the database.

The cause of the bug is that the conditions for verifying whether a table exists in the database are not being properly evaluated. Additionally, the logic for processing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is incorrect, resulting in failing test cases and assertion errors.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements within the `table_exists` function should be modified to accurately determine the existence of a table in the database based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, the processing of the stdout should be validated to ensure the correct parsing of the result.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show tables in {1} '{2}'".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout
```

In this corrected version, the conditional statements have been updated to accurately determine whether a table exists. The result returned by `run_hive_cmd` has been accurately processed to verify the presence of the table. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
