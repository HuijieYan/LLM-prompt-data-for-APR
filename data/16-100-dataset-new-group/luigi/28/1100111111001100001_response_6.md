The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be related to the logic used to determine whether a table exists. In the first `if` statement, the code checks if `stdout` is truthy and if the `table` name is in `stdout`. However, in the failing test cases, the `stdout` value is not being handled correctly for the case where it's not an empty string but still doesn't contain the table name.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the condition in the first `if` statement to also check if the table name is not in the `stdout` when `stdout` is not empty. Additionally, the code should handle case insensitivity for the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
