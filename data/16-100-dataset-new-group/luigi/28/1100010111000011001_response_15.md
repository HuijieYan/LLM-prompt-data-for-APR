The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition checking for the presence of the table in the `stdout` is incorrect. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, regardless of whether the table is in `stdout` or not. 

To fix this bug, the condition should be changed to `table in stdout` to accurately check if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # This can be simplified to return the boolean value of stdout directly
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
