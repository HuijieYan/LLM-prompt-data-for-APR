The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has an issue when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function is case-sensitive, causing it to fail when the table name has a different case from what is returned by Hive. The GitHub issue indicates that the function `table_exists` should be case insensitive to handle these scenarios.

The potential error in the buggy function is the comparison of the table name with the contents of `stdout` without considering the case of the table name. This comparison leads to inconsistent results when the table name has different cases.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` needs to be modified to convert both the table name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive, resolving the reported issue on GitHub. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values for all test cases.
