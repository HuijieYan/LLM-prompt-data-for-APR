To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to compare the tables in a case-insensitive manner. The `stdout` received from the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be converted to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The changes made include converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. This fix should resolve the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub.
