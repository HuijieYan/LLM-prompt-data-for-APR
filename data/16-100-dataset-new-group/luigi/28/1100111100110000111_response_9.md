To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to ensure that it performs a case-insensitive check when comparing tables. We'll also need to update the related test cases to reflect this change.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we've modified the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

This modification will fix the bug and ensure that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected, passing the failing test cases and resolving the GitHub issue.
