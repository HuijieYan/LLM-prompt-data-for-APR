### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling case sensitivity properly. This is causing the tests to fail when checking for the existence of tables with different cases. The function should check the table name in a case-insensitive manner to match the behavior of Hive.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by converting both the table name and the stdout to a consistent case (lower or upper case) before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive, resolving the issue with the failing tests.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```
