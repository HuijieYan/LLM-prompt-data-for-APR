The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not take into account case insensitivity. This results in failing tests when checking for the existence of tables with names that differ only in case.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to check if the lowercase version of the table name exists in the lowercase version of the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version will address the case insensitivity issue and pass the failing tests, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
