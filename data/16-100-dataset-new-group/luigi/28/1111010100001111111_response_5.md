Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test cases, it seems that the bug originates from the case sensitivity of table names in the `table_exists` function. The function does not handle differences in case when comparing the table name in the query output with the actual table name.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output to lower case before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and prevent issues with capitalization.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the comparison of the table name and the output from the query is now case insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports.
