The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be related to how it is handling the `stdout` variable and checking for the presence of the table name within it.

The bug occurs when the function checks if the table name is in the `stdout` variable. It appears that an extra space or newline is causing the comparison to fail, resulting in a false negative. This can be seen in the failing test cases, where the expected `stdout` is `'OK\nmytable'` and `'OK'`, but the function fails to recognize the table name in both cases.

To fix the bug, the function should strip any leading or trailing whitespaces and newlines from the `stdout` before checking if the table name is in it.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() == 'OK'
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ''
```

By using the `strip()` method on the `stdout` variable before comparing it to the expected table name, we ensure that any extra whitespace or newlines are removed, and the comparison is accurate. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
