In the buggy function `table_exists` of the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py`, the issue is that the function is checking the stdout against the table name without performing a case-insensitive comparison. This causes the function to fail when the table names are in different cases than expected.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This fix will ensure that the function performs a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout, resolving the failing tests and satisfying the expected input/output values mentioned earlier. It also addresses the GitHub issue #896 related to making `table_exists` case insensitive.
