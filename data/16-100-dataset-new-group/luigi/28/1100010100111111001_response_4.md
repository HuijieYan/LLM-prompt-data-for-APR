The buggy function has an issue where it is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the database. The problem occurs when the `table_exists` function is called with a table name that is a different case from the one in the system.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling case sensitivity. When checking for the existence of a table, it should consider case-insensitive matching.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to convert the table names to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should be able to pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. The table names are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring case-insensitive matching.
