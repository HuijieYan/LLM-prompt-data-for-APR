The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing because it does not handle the different cases properly. The issue is in the conditional statements that check the return value of `run_hive_cmd` and then return `True` or `False` based on that value. The function is not correctly handling the case when there is more than one table name in the output, as well as when a partition is specified.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional statements to properly handle the different cases. We need to ensure that the function correctly handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, and appropriately processes it to decide whether the table exists or not.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions in the class

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return any(table == t for t in stdout.split('\n') if t)
        else:
            partition_string = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_string))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function handles the different cases where the table name is in the output of `run_hive_cmd` and also correctly handles the case where a partition is specified. With this corrected version, the function should now pass all the failing test cases.
