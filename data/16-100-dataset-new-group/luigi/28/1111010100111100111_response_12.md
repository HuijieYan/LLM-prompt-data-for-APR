The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class causes it to be case-sensitive, leading to failed test cases. The function does not handle case-insensitive comparisons, which is the cause of the failure.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the comparison between the table and the output of the Hive command to be case-insensitive.

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the comparison to use lowercase versions of both the table and the stdout from the Hive command, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing test cases.
