The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

In the provided test cases, the `run_hive_cmd` function is mocked to return certain values. The bug seems to be primarily related to how the function handles the `stdout` variable, which contains the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The buggy function attempts to check if the table exists by looking for the table name in the output of the `show tables` or `show partitions` commands. However, the current implementation does not correctly parse and handle the output, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes the `stdout` variable after running the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `stdout` variable is split by newlines, and then the table name is checked against the resulting list of tables. This ensures that the function correctly determines if the table exists.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
