The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not properly handle the stdout of the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This is evidenced by the discrepancy between the expected and actual values of `stdout` in the runtime test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout is not None and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout is not None
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that the `stdout` is not None in both cases. This ensures that the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly.
