The issue with the buggy function lies in the conditions inside the `if` statements. In both cases, the `stdout` variable contains the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, and the buggy function checks if `stdout` is truthy. In the first `if` statement, it also checks if the `table` is in `stdout`.

The problem occurs because in the first case, the function checks if `table` is in `stdout` as a string, but in the second case, it does not perform a similar check. Additionally, the logic for handling the partition when it's not `None` is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `if` statements to correctly check if the table exists. We also need to handle the partition condition properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s %s""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout != ""
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly determine if the table exists in both cases and handle the partition condition properly.
