The buggy function `table_exists` is implemented within the `HiveCommandClient` class and is intended to check if a table exists in a database. However, when checking for the existence of a table, it is case-sensitive, which leads to test failures in scenarios where the table name has different cases.

The bug is identified in the `table_exists` function, where it performs an exact match of the table name with the output from the Hive command, resulting in case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures case-insensitive matching and resolves the failing test case and GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # No need for if-else conditions here
```

With this corrected function, the test case `test_table_exists` will now pass, and the GitHub issues #896 and #897 will be resolved.
