The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `hive.py` file has several issues. 

The first issue is with the condition `if stdout` and `else: return False`. The condition `if stdout` will evaluate to `True` if there is any value in `stdout`, even if it is just a newline or whitespace. So it will always return `True` when there is any output, which is incorrect.

The second issue is with the string formatting in the line:
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
```
The `%s` placeholders are not being replaced with the correct values from the variables, `database`, `table`, and `self.partition_spec(partition)`.

The correct implementation should handle these issues and should check for the exact presence of the table name and correctly format the command with the specified database, table, and partition.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

This corrected implementation uses `.split('\n')` to check if the table exists in the list of tables, and properly formats the Hive command with database, table, and partition values. With these fixes, the function should now pass the failing test.
