The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not handling case insensitivity correctly when comparing the table name against the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug causes the test cases to fail when comparing the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase, the comparison becomes case insensitive, allowing the `table_exists` function to work correctly.

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
