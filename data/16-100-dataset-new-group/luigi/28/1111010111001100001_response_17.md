The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to incorrect logic when checking for the existence of a table or a table partition in a Hive database. The buggy function seems to return the opposite value of the expected outcome.

The buggy function fails for the following reasons:
1. In the first case, the function returns `False` when the expected outcome is `True` because the `stdout` value is 'OK', and the table exists.
2. In the second case, the function returns `False` when the expected outcome is `True` because the `stdout` value includes the table 'mytable'.
3. In the third case, the function incorrectly returns `True` when the expected outcome is `False` because the `stdout` value includes partitions, indicating their existence.
4. In the fourth and fifth cases, the function returns `False` for identical reasons to case 1 and 2.

To fix the bug, the logic for evaluating the `stdout` after the Hive command execution should be revised.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout
        else:
            partitions = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return partitions is not None and partitions.strip() != ''
```

In the corrected version, for the case when there is no partition specified, we simply check if the `table` is present in the `stdout` obtained from the hive command. For the case when a partition is specified, we check if the `partitions` string is not empty, indicating the existence of the specified partition. This logic should now correctly evaluate the existence of tables and partitions.
