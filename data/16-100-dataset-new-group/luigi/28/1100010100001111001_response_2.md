The buggy function `table_exists` may not be returning the correct values due to the conditions not being properly handled. In the first case, the stdout should contain 'mytable' in the output, which is not handled correctly. Similarly, in the third case, if stdout is not empty, the function should return True, but it's returning based on the stdout value which is incorrect.

To fix these issues, the function should be modified to correctly handle the conditions and return the expected results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split("\n")  # check if the table exists in the list of tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(partition in part for part in stdout.split("\n"))  # check if the partition exists in the list of partitions
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the conditions properly and return the expected results for all the provided test cases.
