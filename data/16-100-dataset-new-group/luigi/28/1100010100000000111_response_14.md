Potential error locations:
1. The comparison of the table name with the stdout.
2. The use of the case-sensitive comparison.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the case-sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the stdout, resulting in the test failing when the table name is capitalized and the stdout returns it in lowercase.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False

```
By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, the function will now handle the case sensitivity issue and make the table_exists function case insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue.
