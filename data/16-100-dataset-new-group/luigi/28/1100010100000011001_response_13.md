The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without being defined or imported. This will cause an error when the function is called.

To fix this bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be defined or imported in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file where the `table_exists` function is located.

Here is the corrected version of the function with a placeholder for the `run_hive_cmd` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def run_hive_cmd(cmd):
    # placeholder for the actual implementation of run_hive_cmd
    pass

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With the `run_hive_cmd` function properly defined or imported, the `table_exists` function will now execute without errors and provide the expected results for the given test cases.
