The buggy function `table_exists` is returning incorrect results based on the failing test cases. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles the `stdout` variable.

The problem arises from how the function is checking the existence of a table in the `stdout` variable. In the first `if` block, the function checks if the table exists in the `stdout` variable. However, in the second `else` block, it only checks if the `stdout` variable exists, but not if the table is present within it.

To fix the bug, we should modify the second `else` block to check if the table exists in the `stdout` variable, similar to how it is done in the first `if` block.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_clause = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_clause})')

        return stdout and table in stdout
```
