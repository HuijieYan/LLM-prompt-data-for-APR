The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug that causes it to be case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the database. This can be problematic as Hive is case insensitive and may return table names in lowercase, causing the function to incorrectly report that the table does not exist.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to check for the lowercase version of the table name in the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions remain unchanged

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Check for lowercase table name in the lowercase stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout  # If stdout is not empty, the table exists
    
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function will now check for the lowercase version of the table name in the output from the Hive command, making it case insensitive and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
