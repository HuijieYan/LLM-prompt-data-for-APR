The bug in the function is that it does not handle case-insensitive table names correctly when checking for table existence. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function is case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, ensuring that the test cases are passed.
