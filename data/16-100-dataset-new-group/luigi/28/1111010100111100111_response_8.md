The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables indicate that the bug occurs due to a case-sensitive comparison of the table name with the output received from the Hive command. This is consistent with the GitHub issues #896 and #897, which request making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to resolve this issue.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to modify the comparison of the table name with the output obtained from the Hive command to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by comparing the lowercase versions of both the table name and the stdout to ensure a case-insensitive match.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```
