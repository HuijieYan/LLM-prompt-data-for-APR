Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issues, the bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The issue has been identified and a fix has been suggested in the GitHub issue, which is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function should implement a case-insensitive check for the table existence by comparing `stdout` and `table.lower()`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
