The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has a few potential error locations. 

1. In the first condition, the function is calling `run_hive_cmd` but is not handling the output `stdout` correctly to check if the table exists.

2. In the second condition, the function is again calling `run_hive_cmd` to check for partition existence, but the return value is not being handled properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` to determine if the table or partition exists. 

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` and check if the table or partition exists based on the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')[1:]  # check if the table exists in the list of tables

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # check if the stdout exists, indicating the partition exists
```

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` by new line and check if the table exists in the list of tables. For partition check, we simply return `bool(stdout)` to check if the partition exists.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
