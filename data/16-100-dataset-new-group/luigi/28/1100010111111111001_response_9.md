The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by incorrect logic in the conditional statements inside the function. The function fails to return the correct result based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.

Based on the failing test cases and the runtime input/output values, it is apparent that the function is incorrectly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd`. The function should return `True` if the table or partition exists in the stdout, and `False` otherwise.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to correctly check if the table or partition exists in the stdout and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```

With the corrected function, the conditional statements are modified to return `True` or `False` based on whether the table or partition exists in the stdout. This addresses the issue and ensures that the function returns the expected output for the failing test cases.
