## Fixing the bug

The bug seems to be in the code's handling of the `table_exists` function when checking the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

1. In the first part of the `table_exists` function, the returned value of `stdout` should be compared to `table` using the `in` operator. However, it seems that the condition is not being evaluated correctly, resulting in incorrect outputs for Case 1 and Case 2.

2. In the second part of the `table_exists` function, the `show partitions` command is not being used correctly, resulting in incorrect outputs for Case 3 and Case 4.

It looks like the `table_exists` function is not properly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function in these cases.

## Corrected code

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return "OK" in stdout.splitlines()  # Check if "OK" is found in the output
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty and return a boolean value
```

This corrected code should address the issues with the original `table_exists` function and make it capable of passing the failing test cases.
