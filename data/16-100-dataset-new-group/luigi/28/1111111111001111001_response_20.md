The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be that it does not properly handle the case when `stdout` is empty. In such cases, it should return `False`, but the function does not explicitly check for this condition. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements to explicitly check for the presence of `stdout` and return `False` if it is empty, as well as remove unnecessary `else` statements. Additionally, we need to ensure that the case of the table name is handled consistently by converting both the input table name and the table names retrieved from `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            # check if stdout exists and table exists in the result
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            # check if stdout exists
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle both cases of non-empty and empty `stdout` and should pass the provided failing tests.
