The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class from the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is causing the failing test. 

The potential error location within the buggy function might be in the `else` condition where the `run_hive_cmd` is being called with incorrect formatting. The cause of the bug is that the function `run_hive_cmd` is being called with incorrect arguments, resulting in incorrect output.

The suggest strategy for fixing the bug is to make sure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with the correct arguments and formatting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Implementation of partition_spec function goes here 

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}={}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            cmd = 'use {}; show partitions {}.{} partition ({})'.format(database, table, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `else` condition in the `table_exists` function formats the partition information correctly and calls the `run_hive_cmd` function with the correct command. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
