The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is concatenating the table name and partition specification without a space in the Hive CLI command. This is causing issues with matching the correct table name and partition specification in the Hive database.

To fix this, the buggy function needs to properly format the Hive CLI command with a space between the table name and the partition specification.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, " ".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function correctly handles the formatting of the Hive CLI command with a space between the table name and the partition specification, which should resolve the issues identified in the failing test cases.
