The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not correctly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database.

The bug appears to be in the logic to check for the existence of a table when a partition is not defined. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` does not work as expected.

The `run_hive_cmd` function is returning the string "OK" which is being evaluated as True by the `table_exists` function, leading to a false positive. This is causing the test for the existence of a table to fail.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` output needs to be checked correctly to ensure that the table actually exists. The logic needs to be updated to check for the exact match of the table name in the command output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like \'{1}\';'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The fix involves using `split()` to convert the `stdout` string into a list of table names and then checking for an exact match of the table name.

This correction should address the false positives in the tests and validate the existence of tables in the Hive database accurately.
