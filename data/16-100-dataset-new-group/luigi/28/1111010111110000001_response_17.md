The buggy function is table_exists in the HiveCommandClient class. The function is returning the wrong result when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The issue seems to arise from the way the function handles the command output from the Hive database and compares it to the expected table name.

The bug causes the failing tests to return False when it should be True. This means that the function is incorrectly identifying the table as not existing even when it does.

To fix this bug, the functionâ€™s logic for checking table existence needs to be updated. Instead of simply comparing the table name with the command output, it should first parse the command output to extract the table names and then check if the specified table exists in the list of tables.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, when checking for a single table existence, the 'show tables' command is used to get the full list of tables, and a split function is used to form a list of tables. If the given table name exists in the list, the function will return True.

For the multiple partitions, the command output is directly checked and if it is non-empty, the function returns True, indicating that the table exists.
