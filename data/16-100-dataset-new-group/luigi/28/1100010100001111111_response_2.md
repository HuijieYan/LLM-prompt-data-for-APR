The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it directly checks if the `table` string exists in the `stdout` string, without considering case sensitivity. The bug is causing the test cases to fail when the table names are not in the same case as in the `stdout` string. The GitHub issue also confirms this and suggests a solution to make the comparison case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` strings to ignore the case. We can achieve this by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that should resolve the issue and satisfy all the provided test cases:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
