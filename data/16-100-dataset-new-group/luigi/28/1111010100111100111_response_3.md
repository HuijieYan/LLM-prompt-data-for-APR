The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it checks for the exact match of the table name from the `stdout` output. However, because Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `stdout` output. This is causing the failing tests as they are expecting case insensitivity.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to account for case insensitivity. By converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase, we can make a case-insensitive match.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before checking for the existence of the table, we ensure that the function is case insensitive, as required by the failing tests and the GitHub issues. This should fix the bug and make the tests pass.
