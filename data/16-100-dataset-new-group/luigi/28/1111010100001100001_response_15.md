The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the `stdout` variable is being used to determine if a table or partition exists.

The first issue is that in the `else` block, the function is checking if `stdout` is not empty and returning `True`, but if it is empty, it is returning `False`. This logic is incorrect, as it should be returning `False` if `stdout` is not empty and `True` if it is empty.

The second issue is with the check `table in stdout`. This code suggests that the `stdout` variable contains a list of tables, and the function is checking if the given table is in that list. However, in the failing test cases, `stdout` contains the output of the `show partitions` command, not the output of the `show tables` command.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the different cases when checking for table or partition existence.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return bool(stdout)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```
