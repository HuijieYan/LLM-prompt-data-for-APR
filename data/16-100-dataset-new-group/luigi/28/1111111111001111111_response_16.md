The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the `table_exists` function. The `table_exists` function should be case-insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The failing tests indicate that the function fails when dealing with table names that are capitalized.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and address the issue posted on GitHub.
