The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to the conditional statement not working as expected and not properly handling the different cases.

The issue seems to be with the condition in the `table_exists` function returning false when it should return true. It also seems that the function is not properly handling the case when a table exists, resulting in an incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the different cases and returns the appropriate values.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_str = ' AND '.join([f"{key}='{value}'" for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition({partition_str})')
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the different cases and pass the failing test.
