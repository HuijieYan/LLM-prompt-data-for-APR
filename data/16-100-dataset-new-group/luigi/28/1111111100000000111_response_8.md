The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the exact case of the table name in the stdout returned from the hive command. This causes issues when tables are defined with capitalized names, as hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the stdout. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case insensitive.

This fix aligns with the suggestions provided in the GitHub issue and will resolve the case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function.
