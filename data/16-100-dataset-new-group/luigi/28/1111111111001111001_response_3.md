The main issue with the buggy function is the incorrect implementation of the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is not properly processing the `stdout` variable and returning the correct boolean values based on whether or not the table exists.

The primary cause of the bug is the mishandling of the `stdout` variable and the conditional checks for its presence. Additionally, the `partition_spec` function is not being used correctly within the `table_exists` method when a partition is provided.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method should properly parse the `stdout` variable and return the correct boolean value according to whether or not the table exists. Additionally, the `partition_spec` function should be invoked correctly with the provided partition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return bool(stdout)
        else:
            partition_str = ",".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With the corrected version, the `table_exists` method processes the `stdout` variable correctly and returns the expected boolean values.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
