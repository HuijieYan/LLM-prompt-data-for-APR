Given the error messages and the runtime input/output values, we can see that the bug is in the `table_exists` function when checking the existence of a table.

The bug is caused by the way the function checks the output of the `run_hive_cmd` command. It is incorrectly using the condition `stdout and table in stdout`, which checks if the `stdout` string is non-empty and contains the `table` name. In some cases, this may not be accurate.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to directly check if the `table` name is in the `stdout` string, without relying on the truthiness of `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version directly checks if the `table` name is in the `stdout` string for both cases, and it also ensures that stdout is a boolean value in the partition case. With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
