Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not being case insensitive. The `table_exists` function checks for the exact case of the table name in the output from the hive command, leading to failures when the cases don't match.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the output from the hive command to lower case.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected function, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lower case using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
