The issue is that the function `table_exists` in the luigi.contrib.hive module is not returning the expected values, leading to failing tests. The error message states that `AssertionError: False is not true`.

The potential error is in the conditional statements within the `table_exists` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and incorrectly checking if the table exists. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements and parsing logic within the `table_exists` function so that it correctly checks for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we have modified the conditional statements and the parsing logic to correctly check for the existence of the table. This version should pass the failing tests.
