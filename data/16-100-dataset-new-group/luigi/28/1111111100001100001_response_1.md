The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the use of the `stdout` variable. It looks like the function is correctly receiving the input parameters and calling other methods to interact with the Hive server, but its logic to determine if a table exists seems to be incorrect.

The main issue seems to lie in the conditional statements using the `stdout` variable. The logic to determine if the table exists in the database and whether a partition exists in the table is incorrect. In some cases, the function is returning `True` when it should be `False`, and vice versa.

To fix this bug, the conditional statements and the check for the `stdout` variable need to be revised. Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # ... (other methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            cmd = """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
            return len(stdout.strip()) > 0
```

In the corrected version:
- We split the `stdout` variable by newline character to check if the table exists in the database.
- We construct the command to check for partitions, and then we check if the length of the `stdout` is greater than 0, indicating that the partition exists.

This revised approach should fix the bug, as it corrects the decision-making process based on the `stdout` variable and seems to be more in line with the expected behavior based on the input parameters.
