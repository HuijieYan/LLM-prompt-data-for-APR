The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug because it checks for an exact match of the table name in stdout, without considering case sensitivity. This causes the failing test cases to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the failing test cases.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function will pass the failing test cases and resolve the issues posted on GitHub (Issue #896 and the related discussion).

This correction makes the comparison of the table name and the stdout case-insensitive, ensuring that the function returns the correct result regardless of the case of the table name in the Hive database.
