The bug is due to the case sensitivity of the table name in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The `table_exists` function is failing because it does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table names in the Hive database, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout should be case insensitive. The table name should be converted to lowercase before comparison, as Hive is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `show tables` stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function addresses the case sensitivity issue and ensures the test cases will pass. This approach aligns with the GitHub issue discussions and suggestions.

The corrected function will now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
