The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database and return True or False accordingly. However, the failing test cases indicate that the function is not case insensitive, which is a known issue as mentioned in the GitHub issues #896 and #1622. The function does not account for case differences between the input table name and the actual table in the database, causing the test failures.

The buggy function directly compares the table name with the result from the hive query, leading to a case-sensitive match. To fix this, a strategy would be to convert both the table name and the result from the hive query to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before comparison, thereby making the function case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

This version addresses the case sensitivity issue by converting both the table name and the result from the hive query to lower case before performing the comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, which resolves the failing test cases and satisfies the expected input/output values.
