## Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not taking into account case sensitivity. This is causing the failing test cases due to the function returning false negatives when checking for table existence.
2. The failing test case checks for table existence using different cases, and the function should pass all the test cases to be considered correct.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is directly comparing the table name with the output from hive, without considering case sensitivity. This causes the test cases that check for different cases of table names to fail.
4. To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to use case-insensitive comparisons when checking the table existence in the output from Hive.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}".format(database, table))
            return stdout.lower() and "partition" in stdout.lower()
```

With the corrected version, the `table_exists` function now performs case-insensitive comparisons when checking for the existence of a table in the output from Hive. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function correctly handles case sensitivity, passing all the test cases.
