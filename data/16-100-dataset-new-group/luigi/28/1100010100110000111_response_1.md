Based on the error message and the GitHub issues, the bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the `table_exists` function when checking for existing tables in Hive. The function does not handle the case insensitivity of Hive, which leads to failing tests when the table names are in different cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle case insensitivity by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this updated function, the comparison between the table name and the stdout is now case insensitive, resolving the issue and making the function behave as expected.
