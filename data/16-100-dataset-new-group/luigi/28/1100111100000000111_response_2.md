Analysis:
The buggy function 'table_exists' checks for the existence of a table in a case-sensitive manner. This has caused issues when the table names are not in the same case as expected. The GitHub issue suggests making the 'table_exists' function case-insensitive by checking stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues.

Potential error locations:
- The comparison of table names in the 'table_exists' function is case-sensitive, causing issues with table names that are not in the expected case.

Cause of the bug:
The 'table_exists' function compares the table name directly with the output of the hive command, which is causing issues when the table names are in different cases.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Modify the 'table_exists' function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparison and also convert the hive command output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
