To fix the bug, we need to make the table_exists function case insensitive when checking the table name in the Hive command output. We can achieve this using the str.lower() method to convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This fix will make the table_exists function case insensitive and should pass the failing tests. It aligns with the GitHub issue #896, which addresses the need to make the table_exists function case insensitive.

With this correction, the table_exists function should now be able to correctly identify the existence of tables in a case insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
