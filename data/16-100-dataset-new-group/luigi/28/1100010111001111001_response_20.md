The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition `if stdout` is used to determine if the table exists. However, this condition will evaluate to True as long as `stdout` is not an empty string, which may not accurately indicate whether the table exists or not.

To fix the bug, we should look for the specific string that represents the table name in the `stdout`. If the table name is found in the `stdout` variable, then the table exists; otherwise, it doesn't.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This version uses `table in stdout` to check if the table exists, and `bool(stdout)` to handle the case when `stdout` is not empty but doesn't contain any table names.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases as it adheres to the expected input/output values.
