The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` is not handling the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly. The `run_hive_cmd` function returns the result of the command execution, and the `table_exists` function checks this result to determine if the table exists in the database. However, the logic for checking the result is not correct, leading to the test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to handle the response from `run_hive_cmd` appropriately. We can use the `in` operator to check if the table name is present in the response, which would be a better approach for checking table existence in Hive.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

With this corrected implementation, the `table_exists` function should now handle the response from `run_hive_cmd` correctly and pass the failing test cases.
