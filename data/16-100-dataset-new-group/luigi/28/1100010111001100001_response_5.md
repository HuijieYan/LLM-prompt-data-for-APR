The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how it handles the `stdout` variable and the condition checking for its existence to determine if a table exists. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the table name is case insensitive. 

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly parse the `stdout` from the hive command to determine if the table exists. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the table name is case insensitive, failing the test for `table_exists`.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly parse the `stdout` from the hive command to determine if the table exists. Additionally, the function should handle the case where the table name is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in tables]
    else:
        partitions = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if partitions:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the stdout and converting all table names to lowercase, we handle the case sensitivity issue. We also modified the stdout parsing to correctly determine if a partition exists in the database. With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
