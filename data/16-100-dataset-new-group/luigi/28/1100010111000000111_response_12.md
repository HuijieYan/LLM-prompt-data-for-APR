The main cause of the bug is that the table_exists function does not handle case insensitivity. It expects the table names in the output of the "show tables" command to be in the same case as the input table name, which might not be the case in Hive since Hive is case-insensitive regarding table names.

To fix this bug, the table names in the "show tables" command output should be compared after converting them to lowercase.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version of the function, the "show tables" command now just retrieves a list of all tables in the current database, and we use the built-in Python method lower() to convert both the input table name and the table names in the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in the table_exists function.
