The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the lack of case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. The function is failing to account for the case insensitivity of Hive, leading to incorrect outputs when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the stdout to ensure case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
In this corrected version, the function first converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method, which makes the comparison case insensitive. This ensures that the function will correctly identify the table's existence regardless of case.

With this correction, the function should now pass all the failing test cases and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
