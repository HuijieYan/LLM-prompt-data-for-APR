The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not check for the table's existence in a case-insensitive manner. This causes the tests to fail when checking for table existence with different cases. The issue on GitHub also confirms that the function should be case insensitive and proposes a fix for it.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` to be case-insensitive.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issues posted on GitHub. The comparison between the table name and `stdout` is now done in a case-insensitive manner.
