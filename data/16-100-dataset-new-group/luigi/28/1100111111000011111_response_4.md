To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to adjust the comparison between the table name and the table names in the stdout to be case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
- The bug was originally caused by a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the table names in the stdout.
- By converting both the table name and the table names in the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method, we can perform a case-insensitive match accurately.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue posted on GitHub related to the case insensitivity in the table existence check.
