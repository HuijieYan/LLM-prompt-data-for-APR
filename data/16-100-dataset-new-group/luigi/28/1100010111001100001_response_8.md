The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it always returns `True` for the partitioned table instead of actually checking if the partition exists. This is due to the incorrect logic in the `else` branch of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `else` branch to correctly check if the partition exists. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and partition in stdout
```

This new version properly checks if the partition exists in the `else` branch and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

Upon running the failing test cases with the corrected function, the tests should now pass.
