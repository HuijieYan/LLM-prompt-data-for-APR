The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test. The function is not properly handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which is causing unexpected behavior.

The bug is occurring in how the function processes the `stdout` variable. In the first condition, the `stdout` is expected to be a string containing the table name, and in the second condition, it is expected to be a boolean indicating the presence of the table.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not properly handling the output from `run_hive_cmd`. It fails to check if the table name is in the list of tables.

To fix the bug, the function should parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to extract the table names and then check if the specified table is in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database)).split()

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).split()

        return any(table in val for val in stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the command `show tables` or `show partitions` is executed, and the output is split into a list. Then we check if the table name is in the list of tables/partitions by using the `in` keyword.

This fix should resolve the failing tests and ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly identifies the presence of a table or partition.
