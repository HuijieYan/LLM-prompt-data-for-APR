The buggy function fails when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The issue seems to be the way the function is checking the existence of a table in the database.

The main problem appears to be that the function `table_exists` is not correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The function `table_exists` needs to properly handle the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd` in order to determine if the table exists in the database.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to split the stdout by newline characters and then check if the table name is within the list of tables.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now properly handle the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd` and pass the failing tests.
