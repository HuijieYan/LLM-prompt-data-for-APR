## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).strip()
    
            return stdout == f"OK\n{table}"
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})").strip()
    
            return stdout != ""
```

In the original implementation of the `table_exists` function, the logic for checking the existence of a table and its partitions is problematic. The function mainly uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to retrieve the list of tables or partitions and then checks if the specified table or partition exists in the output.

The cause of the bug is that the existing logic for checking whether the table or partition exists is incorrect. The function simply checks for the presence of the table or partition name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which is leading to incorrect behavior and causing the test failures.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function now correctly checks whether the command output contains the expected strings to signify the existence of a table or partition. The `stdout` is now also stripped to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

After making these changes, the corrected `table_exists` function should pass the failing tests.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
