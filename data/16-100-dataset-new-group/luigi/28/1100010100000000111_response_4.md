Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The comparison of the table name with the stdout may not handle case sensitivity properly.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing the function to fail when checking for an existing table due to the case sensitivity of the comparison.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout to be case insensitive.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we modified the comparison to be case insensitive by using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase and then perform the comparison. This addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
