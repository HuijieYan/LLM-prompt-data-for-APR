The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The problem arises from the fact that Hive is case-insensitive, and the function is not accounting for this. 

To fix the bug, the function needs to modify the comparison between the table name and the contents of `stdout` to be case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons between the table name and the contents of `stdout`, addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
