The cause of the bug:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case sensitivity of the table names, causing the test cases for case insensitivity to fail. This has been identified as an issue on GitHub, and it is reported that the incorrect handling of case sensitivity is causing test failures.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
The buggy function does not handle the case sensitivity of table names, leading to erroneous results when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive environment.

Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

The corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the function handles the case sensitivity of the table name by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
