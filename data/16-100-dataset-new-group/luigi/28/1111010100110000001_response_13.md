The potential error in the buggy function `table_exists` is in the if and else blocks. The first if-statement checks if `stdout` is not empty and `table` is in `stdout`, but the bug is that it doesn't account for the possibility of newline characters in the returned `stdout`. When `run_hive_cmd` returns "OK\nmytable", the condition `table in stdout` will be False because of the newline character. 

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to strip the newline character(s) from the output of `run_hive_cmd` before comparing it with the table name. We can use the `strip()` method to remove the newline characters, spaces, and other whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string.

Given the explanation, the corrected version of the buggy function is provided below:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.strip()  # Fix: Strip the newline character before comparing
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # The `if` block is not necessary as stdout is already Truthy
```

With the correction, the bug related to the newline character causing the incorrect comparison should be resolved and the function should pass the failing test cases.
