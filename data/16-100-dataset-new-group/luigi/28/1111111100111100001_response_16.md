The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing tests. The issue seems to be with how the function handles the output from `run_hive_cmd`. It is not correctly checking the condition for the existence of a table in the Hive database or the partition.

The `run_hive_cmd` function is mocked to return strings that simulate the output of the Hive shell command. However, the `table_exists` function does not correctly handle this output, leading to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly checks the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine the existence of a table or partition in the Hive database. We should also consider the case insensitivity issue highlighted in the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip().lower() == 'ok'  # Check if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout.strip() != ''  # Check if the partition exists
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `stdout` is properly stripped and converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. We also handle the partition case correctly by checking if the `stdout` is not empty.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
