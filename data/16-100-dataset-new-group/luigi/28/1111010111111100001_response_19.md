The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the incorrect verification of the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable. The function incorrectly returns based on whether `stdout` is a non-empty string, rather than checking if the table name is actually present in the `stdout` output.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly parse the `stdout` output and check if the table name is present in it.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(partition in entry for entry in stdout.split('\n'))
```

This corrected version checks if the table name is present in the `stdout` output using the `in` keyword, and also corrects the partition check to verify if the partition is present in any entry of the `stdout`. This version should pass the failing tests.
