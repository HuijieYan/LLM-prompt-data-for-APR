There is a bug in the `table_exists` method. The bug is due to incorrect indentation and incorrect parameter passing to the `run_hive_cmd` function. The failing test is due to the incorrect handling of input/output in the `table_exists` function.

The cause of the bug is that in the `table_exists` method, the method checks if the output of the command contains the table name. But it fails to do so because the `run_hive_cmd` function is called incorrectly, and the logic for parsing and checking the output is incorrect.

To fix the bug, you need to fix the indentation and the parameter passing in the `table_exists` method. You also need to update the logic to correctly check if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the indentation and parameter passing to `run_hive_cmd` have been fixed. Additionally, the logic for checking if the table exists has been updated to handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly.
