The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function currently does not consider case sensitivity, which causes issues when checking for tables with names that have different capitalization.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` to ensure case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` is performed in lowercase, making it case insensitive. This will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the function returns the correct result, regardless of the capitalization of the table names.
