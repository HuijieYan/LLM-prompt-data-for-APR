The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function does not handle the case where the table names are in different case than expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for case insensitivity of Hive tables. When checking for the existence of a table, it does a direct string comparison without converting both strings to a consistent case (e.g., lower case). This causes issues when the table names are in a different case than expected.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lower case before comparison, making the check case insensitive. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
