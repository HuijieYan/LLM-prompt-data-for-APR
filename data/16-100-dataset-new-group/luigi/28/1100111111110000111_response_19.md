The bug in the `table_exists` function in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` causes it to fail when checking for the existence of a table due to a case sensitivity issue. The GitHub issue suggests that tables defined with capitalized names are returned as lowercase, causing the test to fail due to case sensitivity.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name against the `stdout` result from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to handle case sensitivity by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison.

This fix will address the case sensitivity issue and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, resolving the problem reported in the failing tests and GitHub issues.
