The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be in the conditional statement where the result is returned based on the presence of the table in the `stdout`. The current implementation does not handle the case where the table name is not exactly matched or when there are multiple tables listed in the `stdout`. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to accurately check for the presence of the table in the `stdout` based on the input table name. We should also check the table name case insensitively.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        # return True if the table exists, check case insensitively
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        # return True if there are partitions
        return bool(stdout)
```

The original conditional statements have been replaced with more accurate checks based on the input table name and case insensitivity. The `any` function is used to check if any table in `stdout` matches the input table name.

This corrected version should address the buggy behavior and pass the failing test cases.
