The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from incorrectly processing the `stdout` variable. The function relies on the `stdout` variable to determine whether a table exists or not, but the logic for checking `stdout` is flawed, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we will modify the logic for checking the `stdout` variable and return `True` only when the table is found in the `stdout` for both cases - when there is no partition specified and when there is a partition specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout.split()
```

The `split()` method is used to split the `stdout` string into a list of strings. Then, we simply check if the table name exists in this list, which accurately represents whether the table exists or not.

After making this change, the function should pass the failing test cases.
