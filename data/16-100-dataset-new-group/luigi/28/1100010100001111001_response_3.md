The bug in the given function seems to be the incorrect comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name in the `table_exists` function. The function does not handle the case when the table name is not an exact match with the `stdout` value.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to split the `stdout` response by a newline character and then check for exact matches in the table names.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""
```

This corrected version slices the `stdout` response into lines and checks if the exact table name is present in the lines, rather than checking if it is found in the entire response. This should account for matches in different cases and any extra characters before or after the table name.
