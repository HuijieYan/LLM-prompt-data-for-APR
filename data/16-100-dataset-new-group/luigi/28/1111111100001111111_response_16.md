The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by case sensitivity. The function currently checks if `table` is present in `stdout` without converting both to lowercase, leading to false negatives when the case of the table names doesn't match. The GitHub issue also confirms that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the lowercased `table` and `stdout` to ensure case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will compare `table` and `stdout` in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue of false negatives due to case sensitivity.
