To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both `stdout` and `table` to lowercase before checking if `table` is in `stdout`. This will address the issue described in the GitHub reports and ensure that the function works as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # the corrected version of the function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the described bug should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test cases provided. It now compares the lowercase versions of `table` and `stdout`, making the comparison case insensitive as required.
