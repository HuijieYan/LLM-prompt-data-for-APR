The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is implemented incorrectly, leading to failing tests. 

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly checks if the table exists in the Hive database. The function wrongly compares the string result with the table name, leading to incorrect return values.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function checks for the presence of the table name within the Hive database. We can modify the function to properly extract the table names from the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function and then check if the table name is present in the list of tables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0}'.format(database))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            table_specifier = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, table_specifier))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `show tables` command to get the table names in the database and use the `in` operator to check if the specified table is present. We also use the `show partitions` command correctly to verify the existence of a partitioned table.
This corrected version should address the issues causing the failing tests.
