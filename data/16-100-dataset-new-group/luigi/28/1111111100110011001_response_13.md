The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns `False` instead of checking if the table actually exists. This is evident from the failing test cases, where the expected result is not returned. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database in Hive, and it does this by running a Hive command and checking the output.

The bug occurs in the `else` block of the function, where it constructs a Hive command to show the partitions of a table. It then uses the result of this command to determine if the table exists. In the failing test cases, the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the output "OK" or "OK\nmytable", and the `table_exists` function incorrectly returns `False` in the first case and `True` in the second case. This indicates that the logic for determining table existence based on the Hive command output is incorrect.

To fix this bug, the logic for determining table existence should be adjusted. Instead of simply checking if the output of the Hive command is empty or not, the function should parse the output to determine if the table actually exists.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partitions = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            table_exists = any(partition.strip() == partition_spec.strip() for partition_spec in partitions.split("\n"))
            return table_exists
```

In the corrected version, when the function receives a partition parameter, it checks if the output of the Hive command contains the specified partition. If it does, the function returns `True`, indicating that the table exists with the specified partition. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected results for each input scenario.
