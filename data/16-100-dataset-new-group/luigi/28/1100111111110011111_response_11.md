The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to meet the expected test outcomes. It is causing an 'AssertionError' by returning the wrong value when comparing the expected `stdout` against the actual `stdout` in several test cases.

The cause of the bug lies in the comparison of table names with expected `stdout` in case-sensitive manner. The bug is related to issue #896 on GitHub, where it was discussed that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence. The fix suggested was to compare the table name with `stdout` after converting both to lowercase.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be adjusted to check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner. It should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout` to ensure that case variations do not affect the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the table name and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison to ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.

This correction aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
