Based on the information provided, the cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name against the output from the Hive command. The issue on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive because Hive is case insensitive. This means that when checking for an existing table, the function should compare the table name in lowercase with the output in lowercase. 

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the function checks for the presence of the lowercase table name in the lowercase stdout output for case insensitivity. This change will make the function pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
