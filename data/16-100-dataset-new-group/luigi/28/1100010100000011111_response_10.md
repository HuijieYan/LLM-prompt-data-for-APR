## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function lies in the fact that it does not account for the case-insensitivity of table names in Hive. The function does not compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner, causing issues when the table names have different casing. The two GitHub issues provide the necessary information to understand the problem and suggest a solution.

To fix the bug, the corrected function converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase and then compares them. This approach ensures that the comparison is performed in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub thread.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
