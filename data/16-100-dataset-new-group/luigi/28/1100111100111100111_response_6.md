The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the tests due to case sensitivity when comparing the table names. The issue in GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function compares the table name directly with the stdout without considering case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and the function should now pass the failing tests.
