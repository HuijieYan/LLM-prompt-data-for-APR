The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it fails to correctly check for the existence of a table in certain situations. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the stdout variable, which is the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `stdout` variable is correctly processed and that the table existence check is performed accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_clause = ""
        for key, value in partition.items():
            partition_clause += "{0}='{1}'".format(key, value)
        
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_clause))
        
        return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty, otherwise False
```

This corrected version handles the partition clause properly and returns True if a non-empty `stdout` is retrieved from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This should fix the issues reported in the failing tests.
