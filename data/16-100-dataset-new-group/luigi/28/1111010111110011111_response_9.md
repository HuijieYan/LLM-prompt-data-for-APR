The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case-insensitivity correctly. The failing test `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` indicate that the function is not returning the expected values for different inputs. The error message clearly states that the function is returning `False` when it should return `True` for case-insensitive table name checks.

The GitHub issue #896 for this bug also confirms that the `table_exists` function should be case-insensitive and recommends checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the incoming table name and the table names in the `stdout` to lower case, and then check for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `table` name and the names in the `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing for existence. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.

By making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
