The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the way the function handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` call. The function is expecting the output to be a simple string containing the table name, but in some cases, it is receiving additional information alongside the table name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle the different formats of the `stdout` variable returned from the `run_hive_cmd` call. We can do this by checking for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable using different strategies based on the format of the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    if stdout:
        if isinstance(stdout, str):
            return table in stdout
        else:
            return table in stdout.split('\n')[-1]  # Assuming table name is in the last line
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected version of the function handles the different formats of the `stdout` variable by first checking if it's a simple string and then if it's a multi-line string. It splits the output by the newline character and checks for the presence of the table name in the last line. This approach should be able to handle both the cases where the output is a simple string and where the output contains additional information alongside the table name.
