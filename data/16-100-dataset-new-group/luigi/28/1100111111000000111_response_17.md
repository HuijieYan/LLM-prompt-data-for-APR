The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case insensitivity when checking for existing tables. The bug results in failing the test cases, specifically when a table is defined with a capitalized name, but Hive returns it in lower case.

The buggy function does not account for case insensitivity, which causes the test cases to fail. This has been documented in the GitHub issue #896, and a proposed fix is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the table name against the lower-cased stdout.

To fix the bug, we will modify the `table_exists` function to ensure that it checks for the presence of the table in a case-insensitive manner. Additionally, we need to update the related test cases to include scenarios with capitalized table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive using `lower()`, we address the issue reported in the GitHub bug. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function will now pass the failing test cases and resolve the problem documented in the GitHub issue.
