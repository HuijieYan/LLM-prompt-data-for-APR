The bug in the function `table_exists` is due to the incorrect logic for checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function is returning the opposite of the correct outcome because it is not handling the "OK\n" string properly. Instead of checking if the table is present in the `stdout`, the function is returning the opposite boolean value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the function to correctly handle the "OK\n" string and make sure it returns the correct boolean value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected logic, the function should now produce the correct boolean value for whether the table exists. This should resolve the failing tests and the related error messages.

After applying this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases and no longer produce assertion errors.
