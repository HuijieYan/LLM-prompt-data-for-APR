The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not properly splitting and checking the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function for the presence of the table name. This results in incorrect assertions in the test cases.

The primary issue lies in the following line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
This line checks if the `stdout` is not empty and then checks if the `table` is in the `stdout`. However, the last line of stdout (from `run_hive_cmd`) could contain the table name itself, and this logic is flawed.

A better approach would be to split the `stdout` by newlines and then check if any of the lines in `stdout` match the table name.

To fix the bug, you need to modify the logic within the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            # Split stdout by newlines and check if the table name is present in any of the lines
            return any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version checks if the table name is present in any of the lines in the `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd`, fixing the bug.
