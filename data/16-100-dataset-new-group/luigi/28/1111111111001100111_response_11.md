The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the tests to fail, specifically when comparing table names with the tables returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The bug is due to the fact that the table names are not being compared in a case-insensitive manner. This causes the comparison to fail when the tables are returned as lowercase by the `run_hive_cmd` function, even if the actual table name is provided in uppercase or a mixed case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table names and the tables returned by `run_hive_cmd` to be case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the comparison of the table names and the tables returned by `run_hive_cmd` is now case insensitive, ensuring that table existence checks will pass regardless of the case of the table names.
