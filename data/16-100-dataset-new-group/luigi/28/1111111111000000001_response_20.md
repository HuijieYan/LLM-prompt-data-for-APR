The potential error in the buggy function `table_exists` is that it is using `self.partition_spec(partition)` without properly referencing the function, which can cause an error. Additionally, the conditional statements in the function could be problematic if the expected output doesn't match the actual output from `run_hive_cmd`.

The cause of the bug is that when running the test cases, the function returns incorrect values due to the conditional statements and incorrect referencing. The buggy function does not return the expected values as per the tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the incorrect referencing of the `partition_spec` function and also revisit the conditional statements to ensure they are valid and returning the expected results.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}=\'{}\''.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the incorrect referencing of `self.partition_spec` and replaced the string formatting with f-strings for better readability. We also revised the partition condition to generate the partition string dynamically based on the input dictionary `partition`. These modifications should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
