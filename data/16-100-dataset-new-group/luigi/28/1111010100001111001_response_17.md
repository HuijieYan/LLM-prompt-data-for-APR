The issue with the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the conditional logic and the comparison of the `stdout` variable. It appears that the function does not handle the correct comparison with the `stdout` variable and does not correctly check for the existence of a table or partition.

The main strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional logic to properly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and compare it with the expected values. Additionally, for the case where a partition is specified, the function should use the `self.partition_spec` method to construct the partition query.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_query))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version handles the conditional logic correctly and ensures that the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function is used for comparison. Additionally, when a partition is specified, it constructs the partition query using the `self.partition_spec` method. This updated function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
