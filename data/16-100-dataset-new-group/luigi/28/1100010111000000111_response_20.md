After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test and the GitHub issue, the potential error location is identified in the comparison of table names. The buggy function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence, leading to failing tests and the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the table_exists function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This results in false negatives for existing tables that have different case formatting.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command needs to be case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison uses the lower() method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, making the comparison case insensitive. This change ensures that the table existence check is not affected by the case formatting of the table name.

With this corrected version, the failing test case and the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in table existence checks should be resolved.
