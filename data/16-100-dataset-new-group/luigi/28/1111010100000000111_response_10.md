Analyze:

The buggy function is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function is used to check if a table exists in the specified database. The buggy function currently has a bug that causes it to be case-sensitive when checking for table existence. This means that if the table name is provided in a different case than the one stored in the database, the function will incorrectly return False.

Identify potential error locations:

The potential error location is in the comparison of the table name with the tables retrieved from the `stdout`. The comparison is case-sensitive, leading to incorrect results.

Explanation of the bug:

The bug occurs because the function directly checks if the exact table name is present in the `stdout` output using a case-sensitive comparison. This causes issues when the cases do not match, leading to a False result even if the table exists with a different case.

Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, the comparison of table names needs to be made case-insensitive so that regardless of the case used, the function can correctly identify the existence of the table.

Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    
    """
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` output is made case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the function can correctly identify the existence of the table regardless of the case used.
