The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function should treat table names as case insensitive, but it currently does not. This has been logged as GitHub issue #896 and it has been suggested that the `table_exists` function should be made case insensitive.

To fix the bug, you should modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function will now treat table names as case insensitive, as expected. The corrected function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
