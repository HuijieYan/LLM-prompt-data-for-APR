The buggy function `table_exists` fails for multiple test cases in the file `contrib/hive_test.py`. The main issue seems to be with the incorrect return value in the case where `stdout` is not empty.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves correcting the condition for returning `True` or `False` based on the `stdout` value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Correcting the condition for returning True or False based on the stdout value
```

This corrected function addresses the issue by using `bool(stdout)` to return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, and `False` if it is empty.

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
