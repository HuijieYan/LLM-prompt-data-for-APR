The cause of the bug is that the table_exists function is not properly handling the scenario where the stdout from the hive command has an additional newline character in it.

The buggy function first runs the hive command and captures the stdout. Then it checks if the table exists in the stdout by using the 'table in stdout' syntax. The issue arises because the stdout has a trailing newline character, which makes the comparison fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the trailing newline character from the stdout string before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.strip()  # Remove the trailing newline character before the comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # No need for an if-else statement, directly return the boolean value of stdout
```

By using the `stdout.strip()` method, we remove any trailing whitespace characters from the stdout, including the newline character. This ensures that the table name comparison is accurate.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the scenario where the stdout includes an additional newline character, and the failing test cases should pass.
