The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic used to check for the existence of a table with or without a specified partition. The `table_exists` function is not returning the correct result based on the input. The bug causes the test `test_apacheclient_table_exists` to fail because it expects certain return values from the `table_exists` function, but it receives different ones due to the bug.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve correcting the logic inside the `table_exists` function to properly handle the cases where a partition is specified and where it is not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table}')
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        return partition_str in stdout
```

With this corrected version, the function should return the expected boolean values based on the input parameters, and the failing test should pass.
