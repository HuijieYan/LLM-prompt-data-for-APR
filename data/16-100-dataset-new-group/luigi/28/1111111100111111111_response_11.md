The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing table names. The function fails to account for the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive database, leading to failed assertions in the provided test cases.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function will now compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that the test cases will pass as expected. This solution also addresses the GitHub issues #896 and the related discussions regarding the case insensitivity of table existence checks in the Hive database.
