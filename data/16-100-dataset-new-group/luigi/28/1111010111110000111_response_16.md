The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case-insensitive table names correctly. The failing test `test_table_exists` checks for table names in both upper and lower case, and the current implementation does not handle case insensitivity.

The error message from the failing test shows that the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)` fails when checking for a table in title case.

The GitHub issue #896 describes the problem as an issue where the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive. The issue details mention that the table names are returned in lowercase by Hive and they are not being compared accurately.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name from the stdout in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected function converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This ensures case insensitivity in comparing table names, thus resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
