## The bug in the provided function

The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing it to return incorrect values. The main issue lies in how the function is checking the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `table_exists` function is expecting the output to be a substring of the `stdout` variable, but it's not handling the newline character properly. This leads to incorrect results and failing test cases.

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function checks the `stdout` variable to properly handle the newline character. We should also ensure that the return value of the function matches the expected output in all cases.

## The corrected function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return 'OK' in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return 'OK' in stdout.split('\n') or table in stdout
```

This corrected function properly handles the newline character and checks for the presence of 'OK' in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
