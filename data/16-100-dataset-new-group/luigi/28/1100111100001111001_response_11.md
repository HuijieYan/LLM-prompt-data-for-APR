## Cause of the bug

The bug appears to be caused by a problem with the conditional logic in the `table_exists` function. In both cases where a query is run using the `run_hive_cmd` function, the function simply checks if `stdout` is truthy or falsy and returns accordingly. This means that any non-empty `stdout` will be considered as `True`, regardless of its actual content.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements and improve the logic for checking the existence of a table or a table partition. This can be achieved by modifying the way we check the value of `stdout` after running the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## The corrected version

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('''use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} 
                                like "{3}"'''.format(database, database, table, partition))
    
            return partition in stdout.split()
```
