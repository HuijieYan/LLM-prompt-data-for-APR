### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` might not handle case sensitivity.
2. The condition `if stdout:` may not correctly handle the case insensitivity.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the table names in the `table_exists` function. When the function receives a table name, it compares it to the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. If the table name is in a different case than the output, the comparison fails, resulting in the wrong output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` need to be compared in a case-insensitive manner.

### Corrected Version
The corrected version of the function using a case-insensitive comparison:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
By using the `lower()` method, a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is achieved. This will ensure that the function works correctly for tables with different casing.
