To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between `stdout` and `table` case insensitive. This will ensure that the function works correctly with tables that have different casing.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` in the comparisons, we make the checks case insensitive and ensure that the function works as expected, resolving the issue in GitHub.
