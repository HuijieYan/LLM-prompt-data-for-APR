The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the condition checking for the existence of a table. The condition checks if the output `stdout` is Truthy and if the `table` is in the `stdout`. However, the test cases indicate that the function is not returning the expected results.

The bug is likely caused by the way the function handles the `stdout` and the table names when checking for existence.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for exact table name matches in the `stdout` and handle cases where the table name is a substring of another table name in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database="default", partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return stdout == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            'use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
        return partition in stdout
```

This corrected version should now pass all the provided failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
