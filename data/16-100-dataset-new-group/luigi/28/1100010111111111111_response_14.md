The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case-insensitive when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. This leads to failing tests when the table name casing doesn't match. The expected behavior should be case-insensitive comparison.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should implement a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before checking for existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected function, the tests should pass, and the function should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
