The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name to the stdout. The issue on GitHub refers to the fact that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive.

The cause of the bug is as follows:
The function `table_exists` compares the `table` parameter to the `stdout` after running a Hive command. If the table name is capitalized and the `stdout` contains the table name in lowercase, the function will return False, even if the table exists.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the table name and the `stdout` after converting both to lowercase, the function will now be case insensitive, as expected.

This corrected version of the function should pass all the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
