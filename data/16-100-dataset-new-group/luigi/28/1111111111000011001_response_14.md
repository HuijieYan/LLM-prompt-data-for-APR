The bug in the given function `table_exists` is that the logic in the two branches of the if-else statement to check if a table exists based on whether a partition is provided is incorrect. The first branch checks for the existence of the table in the database when no partition is provided. The second branch attempts to find the partition using the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks if the output is not empty to determine the existence of the table.

The problem lies in the way the return value of `run_hive_cmd` is being handled. The condition `if stdout` will always evaluate to True because even an empty string is considered as a truthy value in Python.

To fix this bug, we need to explicitly check for the presence of the table name in the output of `run_hive_cmd` for both branches of the logic.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... previous code here ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_output = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return partition_output and table in partition_output
```

Now the corrected `table_exists` function explicitly checks for the presence of the table in the output of `run_hive_cmd` in both branches of the logic, addressing the bug.

The corrected function should now pass the provided failing test.
