Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
    
            return bool(stdout)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)

```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function `table_exists` lies in the use of the `show tables` and `show partitions` commands in the `stdout` assignment. The `show tables` command should use 'in' instead of 'like', and the `show partitions` command should have the correct partition specification.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct syntax for the `show tables` command.
2. Use the correct syntax and partition specification for the `show partitions` command.
3. Simplify the return statements to return the result of the `stdout` check directly.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and returns the correctly updated stdout.
