The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it does not handle the case insensitivity of table names in Hive. The function needs to check the existence of tables in a case insensitive manner.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to compare the lowercased table names with the lowercased stdout from the hive command.

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        table_lower = table.lower()
        
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
    
            return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition).lower()
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition ({3});'.format(database, database, table_lower, partition_str))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, table names are converted to lowercase before comparing with the stdout from the hive command. This ensures a case insensitive comparison and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

The updated function should now satisfy all the expected input/output cases and address the reported issue on GitHub.
