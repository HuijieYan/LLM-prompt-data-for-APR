The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a couple of issues.

1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being used, but it's not imported or defined anywhere in the provided code, leading to a NameError when the function is called within `table_exists`. This is the potential cause of the bug as it's not clear what `run_hive_cmd` is supposed to do or return.

2. The logic within the function seems to be inconsistent, as it's using the same variable `stdout` to store the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function for both the partitioned and non-partitioned cases. 

To fix this, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be properly imported or defined, and its behavior needs to be understood in order to verify that it's returning the expected output. Additionally, the logic within the `table_exists` function might need to be refactored for better clarity and consistency.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout != ""
```

In this corrected version, I've assumed that `run_hive_cmd` returns the output of the command and that it's consistent with the way it's being used in the original function. I've also removed unnecessary `if` conditions and simplified the return logic for the partitioned case.

Please note that without the `run_hive_cmd` function definition or import, the behavior of the corrected `table_exists` function can't be fully verified.
