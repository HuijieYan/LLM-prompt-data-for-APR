The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table. It should be case-insensitive according to the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity. When checking for the existence of a table, it compares the table name directly with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case differences. 

A strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using the corrected version of the function, the tests should now pass and the issue on GitHub should be resolved.
