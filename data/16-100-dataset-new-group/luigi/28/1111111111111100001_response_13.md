The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by a discrepancy between the expected and actual behavior of the function. The function expects the output (`stdout`) of the `run_hive_cmd` function to contain a certain substring, but the conditions for checking this substring are incorrect.

The bug can be fixed by updating the conditional statements that check the `stdout` variable and reorganizing the logic to handle the different cases more accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return bool(stdout)
        else:
            if not isinstance(partition, dict):
                raise ValueError('Partition must be a dictionary')

            partition_string = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});".format(database, table, partition_string))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By using `bool(stdout)` instead of comparison with table names and minor updates in handling the partition, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
