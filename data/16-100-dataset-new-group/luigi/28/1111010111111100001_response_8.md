The issue with the buggy function seems to be the logic inside the `table_exists` method. It's not correctly handling the presence of the table in the returned `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

The logic should check if the table exists in the stdout, and if it does, return `True`, otherwise return `False`.

A potential fix for the bug in the `table_exists` method:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this revised version, for the case when `partition` is `None`, the `table in stdout` returns a boolean which indicates whether the table is in the result or not. For the case when `partition` is not `None`, as long as `stdout` has some value (i.e., it's not an empty string), it returns `True`.

This revised logic should address the issues identified in the failing test cases and should produce the expected results.
