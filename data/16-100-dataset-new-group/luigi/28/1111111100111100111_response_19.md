Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function is failing to correctly identify the table due to case differences in the table name.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the tables in the Hive database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the tables in the Hive database, the function will be case insensitive and should pass the failing test.

This fix addresses the reported GitHub issue #896, which requested making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
