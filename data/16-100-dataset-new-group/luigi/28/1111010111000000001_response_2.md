The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a couple of issues that need to be fixed.

1. Issue: In the `table_exists` function, the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without importing it from anywhere in the module. This will result in a NameError when the function is called.

2. Issue: The logic within the function is not correctly checking for the existence of the specified table or partition. The current implementation does not handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to import and use the `run_hive_cmd` function properly. Additionally, we need to modify the logic within the function to check for the existence of the table or partition accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version:
1. We have used `self.run_hive_cmd` to call the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. For the case when `partition` is `None`, we split the `stdout` by `\n` and check if the `table` exists in the resulting list.
3. For the case when `partition` is not `None`, we directly check if `stdout` is not empty and return accordingly.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
