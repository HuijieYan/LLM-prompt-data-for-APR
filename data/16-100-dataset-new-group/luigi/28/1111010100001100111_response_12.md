Based on the GitHub issue and the runtime input/output values, it is evident that the problem arises from the fact that the `table_exists` function does not account for case differences, causing tests to fail when comparing table names with inconsistent capitalization.

To address this issue, the `table_exists` function should be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table name extracted from the returned `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, case differences are eliminated by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This modification ensures that the function can accurately determine the existence of a table, regardless of capitalization inconsistencies.
