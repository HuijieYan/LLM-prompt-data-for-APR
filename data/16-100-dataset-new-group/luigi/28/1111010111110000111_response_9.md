The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it incorrectly checks for table existence in a case-sensitive manner. This bug is causing the failing test cases `test_table_exists` in the `contrib.hive_test.py` file. Additionally, this bug is also related to the GitHub issues #896 and the one raised by a user regarding case-insensitivity of `table_exists` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` directly checks for the exact table name in the `stdout` returned from the `hive` command, without considering the case of the table name. This leads to inconsistent results when comparing table names with different cases and results in failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, as expected.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive. Additionally, the `if` condition is simplified to directly return the boolean value of `stdout`.

This corrected version will address the bug and ensure that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected, passing the failing test case, and resolving the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity.
