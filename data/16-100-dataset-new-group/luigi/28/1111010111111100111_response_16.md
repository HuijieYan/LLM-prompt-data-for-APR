The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases. The problem arises due to case sensitivity when checking the presence of tables in the Hive database. The GitHub issue also highlights that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive. The provided test case `test_table_exists` is checking for the presence of tables in both uppercase and lowercase.

The potential error location in the function is where the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` is being done. It is found in both branches of the if-else condition within the `table_exists` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case insensitivity of the table names properly. The `table_exists` function assumes that the table names provided as input are in the same case as they are stored in the Hive database, leading to test failures when checking for table existence.

To fix this, the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table` and `stdout` are both converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is now case insensitive, which addresses the issue. This correction should also resolve the problems highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

Additionally, the same correction should be made in the `apacheclient_table_exists` function to ensure consistency in handling table names.
