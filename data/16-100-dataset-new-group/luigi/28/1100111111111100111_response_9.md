# The buggy function
The `table_exists` function is meant to check if a table exists in a given database. It should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't. However, the tests are failing due to case sensitivity issues.

# Bug
The bug is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the `table_exists` function. The function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, causing the tests to fail.

# Fix Strategy
Modify the comparison to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

# The corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
