The bug in the `table_exists` function is the case sensitivity of comparing the table name against the stdout. The issue on GitHub also confirms that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the result obtained from stdout, as Hive is case insensitive.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With the corrected version, the comparison of the table name and the result from stdout is case insensitive, ensuring that the function works correctly for tables with different casing.
