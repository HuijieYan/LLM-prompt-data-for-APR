The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing failing tests and GitHub issues related to table existence check being case insensitive.

The bug lies in the following line of code:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
This line does a case-sensitive check for the `table` name in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the line should be modified to ensure a case-insensitive check. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase and then performing the check.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function is now able to perform a case-insensitive table existence check when the table name is provided. This should address the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
