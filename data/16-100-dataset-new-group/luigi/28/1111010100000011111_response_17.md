The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not case insensitive when checking if a table exists in the database. The function directly compares the table name to the output from the `show tables` command, which can cause issues if the case of the table name is different.

To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from the `show tables` command to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the `show tables` command, making the comparison case insensitive.

This fix will address the issue described in the GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output values for all test cases.
