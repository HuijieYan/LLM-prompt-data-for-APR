The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the conditional statement in the first part of the function checks whether `stdout` is not empty and the `table` exists in `stdout`, but in the second part of the function, it only checks if `stdout` is not empty.

To fix this bug, we should modify the second part of the function to also check if the `table` exists in `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table in stdout
```

With this correction, the function now checks if `table` is in `stdout` in both parts of the conditional statement, which should resolve the bug and satisfy all the expected input/output values provided.
