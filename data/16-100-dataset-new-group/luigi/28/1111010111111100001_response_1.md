The bug is likely in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function fails the test because it doesn't properly handle the running of the Hive commands and the extraction of the output. This results in incorrect values being returned, causing the test assertions to fail.

The issue seems to be with how the output of the `run_hive_cmd` is being processed and evaluated. The logic of the function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle different cases of output and properly return the expected boolean values.

The problem is that the `table_exists` function doesn't correctly parse the output of the Hive commands to determine if the table exists or not. It fails to account for the different cases in the output and doesn't handle the partition argument correctly. 

To fix the bug, modify the `table_exists` function to properly handle the different cases of `stdout` when running Hive commands and to correctly process the partition argument. Make sure to properly check if the table exists based on the command output and the partition argument.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the function now correctly checks for the existence of the table based on the output of the Hive commands and the partition argument. This should address the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
