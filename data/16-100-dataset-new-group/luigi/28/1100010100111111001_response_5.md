The buggy function is the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function checks whether a table or partition exists in a Hive database and returns a boolean value based on the result.

The specific issue causing the failing tests is related to the comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name. The function checks if the table name is directly in the `stdout` string, but it does not handle cases where the table name is preceded by other characters.

The issue is evident from the failing tests where the table name is "mytable" and "MyTable". The function incorrectly returns a boolean based on the exact presence of the table name in the `stdout` string.

To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison of table names in the `stdout` string and ensure it handles potential variations in the format of the `stdout` string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. For the `table_exists` function without a partition, the `show tables` command is used to get a list of tables. We then split the `stdout` string by newlines and check if the stripped table names match the specified table.
2. For the `table_exists` function with a partition, we simply return `bool(stdout)` to check if the command returns any output.

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and maintain the expected input/output values.
