The root cause of the bug is that the table existence check is case-sensitive, which is causing the test to fail when the table names are in different cases. The issue on GitHub indicates that the table_exists function should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the table existence check so that it compares the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` we compare the table name and the output from Hive in a case-insensitive manner, which resolves the issue raised on GitHub and satisfies the expected input/output values.
