The bug in the function `table_exists` is that it returns an incorrect result for the case where the table exists when the test case is executed, causing the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function returns `True` when `stdout` is not empty after running the hive command, and `False` when `stdout` is empty. However, in the test cases provided, the `stdout` also contains the string "OK", which causes the function to return `False` even when the table exists.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to modify the condition for returning `True` to explicitly check if the table name is included in the `stdout`. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly even when "OK" is present in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).strip()

        return stdout == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).strip()

        return stdout == self.partition_spec(partition)
```

With this corrected version, the function will return `True` only if the table name is found in the `stdout` and `False` otherwise. This should resolve the bug and make the test cases pass.
