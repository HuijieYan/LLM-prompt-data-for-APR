The buggy function is `table_exists`, and it is designed to check whether a table exists in a Hive database. The function takes in three parameters: `table`, `database`, and an optional `partition`. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to make a Hive command and then checks the `stdout` to determine if the table exists.

There are two different cases where the `run_hive_cmd` function is used within the `table_exists` function:
1. When `partition` is `None`, the function runs `show tables` command to check for the existence of the table in the default or specified database.
2. When `partition` is not `None`, the function runs a command using a specific partition on the table to check its existence.

The bug likely exists in the second part of the function where the command is being formed using the `partition_spec` method.

Based on the provided runtime input/output values, it seems that the `run_hive_cmd` is not returning the expected output when the command is formed using the `partition_spec` method. This could be due to an issue with the command formation or the `partition_spec` method itself not returning the correct partition value.

To fix the bug, we should first ensure that the `partition_spec` method returns the correct partition value. Then, we need to ensure that the command formed using this partition value is correct and can retrieve the table's existence from the Hive database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = '/'.join(['{}={}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)
```
