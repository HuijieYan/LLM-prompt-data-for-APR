The bug in the `table_exists` method is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `self.partition_spec` function. The failing tests indicate that the method is returning the wrong values.

The bug occurs because `run_hive_cmd` is not used correctly, which leads to unexpected return values and assertions failing. Additionally, the `self.partition_spec` method is being called incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called with the correct parameters, and the `self.partition_spec` method should be used appropriately to generate the partition specifications.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_query))
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In this fixed version, the correct parameters are used to call the `run_hive_cmd` function, and the `self.partition_spec` method is used appropriately to generate the partition specifications. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing tests.
