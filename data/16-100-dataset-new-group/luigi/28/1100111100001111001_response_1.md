The buggy function has multiple issues. The first issue is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called without the appropriate import and reference. The second issue is with the `run_hive_cmd` function itself, as it is not returning the expected values. 

To fix the code, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be imported at the beginning of the file. Then, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be updated to return the correct values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

from some_module import run_hive_cmd  # Import the run_hive_cmd function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
