Based on the information provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the case sensitivity of table names when checking for their existence. The function currently does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table name when comparing it to the `stdout` value. This leads to failing test cases when the table names have different case representations.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` value to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to the case sensitivity of table existence checks.
