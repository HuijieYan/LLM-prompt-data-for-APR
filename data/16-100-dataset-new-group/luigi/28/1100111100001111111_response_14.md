To fix the bug, we have to make the "table_exists" function case insensitive when comparing the table name with the stdout. This will ensure that the function can identify tables regardless of their case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the "table_exists" function is now case insensitive when comparing the table name with the stdout, and it satisfies the expected input/output values as well as resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
