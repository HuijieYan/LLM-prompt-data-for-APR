The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the test to fail due to case sensitivity issues. Based on the error message and the expected input/output values, it is clear that the bug is related to case sensitivity in comparing table names.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not performing a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This results in the test failing when checking for table existence with different casing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the table_exists function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table.lower()` is used to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout.lower()`, which is also converted to lowercase. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison, fixing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This corrected version will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
