The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by a case sensitivity issue when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The test cases in the failing test function are not handling case sensitivity properly. The GitHub issue #896 confirms this problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to ensure it checks for the existence of tables in a case-insensitive manner. This can be accomplished by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the case sensitivity issue reported in GitHub issue #896.
