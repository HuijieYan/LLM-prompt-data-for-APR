The buggy function is failing because it is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists in the database. The function currently compares the table name directly with the output of the command, which may not match the case. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names are in different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we are using the `lower()` function to convert both the table name and the output of the command to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and the function can accurately determine if the table exists in the database, regardless of its case.
