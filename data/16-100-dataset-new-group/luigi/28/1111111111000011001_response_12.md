                partition_str = "/".join(["{0}={1}".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
                stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str))
            else:
                stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition))

```

Explanation:
1. The bug in the original code is that the `partition_spec` method is being called without checking if `partition` is a dictionary or not. This leads to incorrect behavior when constructing the command to check if a partition exists in the table.
2. The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle the `partition` input correctly. The original code directly calls `self.partition_spec(partition)` without considering the type of `partition`.
3. The corrected version checks if `partition` is a dictionary, and constructs the command accordingly. It also uses `bool(stdout)` instead of explicit if-else to return True or False.
4. By checking the type of `partition` and constructing the command appropriately, we can fix the bug and ensure that the correct command is executed to check if a partition exists in the table.
