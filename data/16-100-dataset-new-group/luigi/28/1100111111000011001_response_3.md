The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a specified table exists in a given database and partition. However, there are several issues within the function that lead to failing test cases. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions, which are expected to return specific values based on the input parameters. 

The bugs in the `table_exists` function are identified as follows:
1. When the table exists and there is no partition specified, the function returns the incorrect value.
2. When the table exists and there is a partition specified, the function returns the incorrect value.

Strategy for fixing the bugs:
1. Modify the condition for checking the existence of the table and its partition.
2. Ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions are being called with the correct input parameters.

Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like \'{1}\';'.format(database, table))
            return 'OK' in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")
            
            return partition_str in stdout.split('\n')
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the `run_hive_cmd` function is used to execute Hive commands, and the output is appropriately checked for the existence of the specified table and partition.

Now, with the corrected function, it should pass the failing test cases and return the expected values for each case.
