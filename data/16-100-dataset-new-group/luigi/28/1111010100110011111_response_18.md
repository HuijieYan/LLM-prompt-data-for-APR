## The potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The `if` condition for the first case is not checking for a specific substring in stdout. Instead, it is just checking if stdout exists which may not be sufficient.
2. The `if` condition for the second case is simply checking if stdout exists, but it should be checking for a specific substring.
3. The `else` part of the second case may not be necessary as it could be simplified.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The bug appears to be caused by the function not handling case insensitivity properly. This is consistent with the GitHub issue that suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive. The function is currently checking if the table name is in the stdout without taking into account the case of the table name.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This change would make sure that the comparison is case insensitive.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```
