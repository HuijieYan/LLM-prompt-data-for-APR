The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns the wrong result when the given table name is present in the output of the run `hive` command. It is supposed to return `True` when the table exists and `False` when it doesn't. However, in the buggy version, it returns `True` when the table exists, but also when there is no table at all. This is caused by a mistake in the condition when checking for the table name in the command output.

The current condition is:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```

This condition checks whether the `stdout` variable is not empty and then whether `table` is found in `stdout`. This is incorrect because even if `stdout` is empty, the code still returns `True` regardless of whether the table exists. We need to change the condition to check if the table is in the `stdout` only when `stdout` is not empty.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')  # Split stdout and check table existence
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simply return whether stdout is empty or not
```

In this corrected version, we use `stdout.split('\n')` to convert the `stdout` string into a list of lines and then check whether `table` is found in that list. For the case where `partition` is not `None`, we simply return `bool(stdout)` to indicate whether `stdout` is empty or not.

This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result for the given test cases.
