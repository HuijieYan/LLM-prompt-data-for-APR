The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing tests to return incorrect values. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles the `stdout` variable to determine if a table exists in the database.

Currently, the function checks if the `stdout` is not empty and if the table name is contained in it. However, the way it handles the newline characters in the `stdout` variable seems to be incorrect.

To fix this issue, one potential strategy is to modify the logic for checking the existence of the table using the `stdout` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()  # Split the stdout on newline and check for table existence
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

This updated code splits the `stdout` on newline characters and checks for the existence of the table. In the case where a partition is specified, it simply checks if `stdout` is not empty and returns `True`. This should resolve the issues with the failing tests.
