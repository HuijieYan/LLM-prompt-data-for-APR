The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This leads to test failures when the table names have different cases than the ones returned by Hive.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner against the stdout from the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison, making the comparison case-insensitive.

This fix addresses the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making `table_exists` case insensitive to avoid issues with table names of different cases.

With the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, it should pass the failing tests and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
