## Potential error locations:
1. The comparison of table names and partition spec is case sensitive.
2. The function might not be handling case insensitivity correctly.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison of table names and partition spec being case sensitive. This is highlighted by the GitHub issue, which states that sometimes tables are defined in capitalized form, but Hive returns them as lower case. As a result, the comparison fails, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle case insensitivity when comparing table names and partition spec. The suggested strategy from the GitHub issue is to check stdout against table.lower(), which will avoid case issues. This means converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the lower() method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
