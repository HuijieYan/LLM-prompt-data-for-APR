The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test to not pass. The issue is that the `run_hive_cmd` function does not return the expected output in all cases. It returns "OK" when the table exists and an empty string when it doesn't exist. However, the `table_exists` function checks for `stdout` and expects the table name to be present in it.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to handle the cases where `run_hive_cmd` returns "OK" and an empty string. We should also handle the partition case properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the provided test cases should now pass and the bug should be fixed.
