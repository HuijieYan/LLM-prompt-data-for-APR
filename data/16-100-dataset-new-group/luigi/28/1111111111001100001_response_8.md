The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by a wrong condition that checks for the existence of a table in the hive command output. The bug is triggered when a table name is part of another table name.

The bug is causing the failing test cases because the function is incorrectly checking for the existence of the table in the hive command output. Specifically, the bug is in the conditional check `table in stdout`, which can return an incorrect result when the table name is a substring of another table name.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to check that the table name appears as a whole word in the `stdout`. To do this, we can use regular expressions to match the table name surrounded by word boundaries.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function using regular expressions:

```python

import re

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other class methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like \'{1}\';'.format(database, table))
    
            return bool(stdout) and re.search(r'\b{}\b'.format(re.escape(table)), stdout) is not None
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)

```
