Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive. The GitHub issues indicate that the function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function is currently failing the tests due to case sensitivity issues.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
