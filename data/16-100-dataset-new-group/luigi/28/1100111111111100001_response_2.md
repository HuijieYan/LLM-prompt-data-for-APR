The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way it handles the `stdout` variable to determine whether a table or partition exists in the specified database. The buggy function returns the value of the `stdout` variable directly, which can lead to incorrect evaluations when checking for the existence of tables or partitions.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic used to check the existence of tables and partitions based on the value of `stdout`. We also need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called correctly and that the `stdout` variable is processed appropriately based on the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other functions

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            tables = stdout.split("\n")
            return table in tables
        else:
            partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_query))

            return bool(stdout)
```

We split the `stdout` variable into individual lines to create a list of tables and then check if the specified table exists in that list. Similarly, for the case when a partition is specified, we call the `run_hive_cmd` function with the appropriate query and return whether the `stdout` value is non-empty.

This revised logic ensures that the buggy function can handle both tables and partitions more accurately.
