The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not handle case-insensitivity when checking for table existence in the HiveClient. The issue described on GitHub suggests that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive, as Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lower case, causing the function to fail when comparing names.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner, by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lower case before the comparison.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lower case using `lower()` before comparison, addressing the case insensitivity issue. This fix satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
