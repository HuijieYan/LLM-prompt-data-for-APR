The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the incomplete handling of the `stdout` returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

It appears that the function is checking for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` when the `partition` parameter is None, but it is not handling the case when `partition` is not None properly. The function constructs and runs a Hive command using the `run_hive_cmd` with the partitions, but it does not properly check the `stdout` in this case. 

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `stdout` returned when the `partition` parameter is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # Using bool() to check if stdout is not empty
```

This corrected version should handle both cases of `partition` correctly and pass the failing tests.
