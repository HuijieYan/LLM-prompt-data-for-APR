To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lower case, the comparison will be case-insensitive and the function should now pass the failing tests. This fixes the issue reported on GitHub (#896), which requested a case-insensitive comparison for table names.

Please note that changes should also be made in `hive_test.py` to test the corrected behavior of the `table_exists` function.
