The buggy function `table_exists` is meant to return True if a given table exists in a specified database, and False if it doesn't. The first issue with the function is the usage of `run_hive_cmd` function, which is not imported directly. The second issue is the incorrect string formatting used in the function calls.

The failing test case shows that when the value is returned from the `run_command` function, the expected result is not being achieved. The error message shows that in the failing test, even when the table exists, the function returns False instead of True, leading to an AssertionError.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be correctly imported. Additionally, the incorrect string formatting in the `stdout` assignments should be addressed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

I have corrected the usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function by calling it through the `self` reference. Additionally, I have fixed the string formatting issue and used `strip()` to ensure that whitespace does not affect the result.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass both of the failing test cases.
