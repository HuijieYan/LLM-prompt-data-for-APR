The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly checking for the existence of tables in the 'table_exists' method of the HiveCommandClient class. In Case 1 and Case 4, the function returns False when it should return True. This is because for both cases, the stdout is 'OK' and the table is present in the output, but the function incorrectly returns False.

In Case 2 and Case 5, the function incorrectly returns True when it should return False. This is because the function does not account for case insensitivity and erroneously identifies the table as existing.

In Case 3 and Case 6, when the 'partition' parameter is not None, the function does not handle the 'show partitions' command properly, resulting in incorrect results from 'stdout'.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly parse the output of the hive commands to identify the existence of the table.

To fix the bug, the function should properly parse the output of the hive commands and handle case insensitivity. Additionally, when the 'partition' parameter is not None, it should construct the correct 'show partitions' command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return any(t.strip().lower() == table.strip().lower() for t in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1};'.format(database, table))
            return any(p.strip().lower() == self.partition_spec(partition).strip().lower() for p in stdout.split('\n'))
```
