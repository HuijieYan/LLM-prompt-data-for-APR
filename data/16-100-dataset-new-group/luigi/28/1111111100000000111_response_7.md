Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function, it seems that the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. The current implementation of the `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity, leading to failures when checking for tables in different cases than specified in the code.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison, making the check for table existence case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

This fix addresses the issue of case sensitivity in table_exists and should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
