The cause of the bug:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is called without importing it directly within the `HiveCommandClient` class.
2. The `partition_spec` function is not defined within the `HiveCommandClient` class, but it is being called as a method of the `self` object.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `run_hive_cmd` function directly within the `HiveCommandClient` class.
2. Define the `partition_spec` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd  # Import run_hive_cmd directly

        def partition_spec(partition):  # Define partition_spec within the class
            # Please ignore the body of this function

        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the above corrections, the `table_exists` function should now work as expected and pass the failing test provided.
