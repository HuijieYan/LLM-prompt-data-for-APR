In the buggy function `table_exists`, there are two potential error locations:
1. In the if-else statement, the condition for checking if `stdout` is not empty and `table` is in `stdout` is not being handled properly.
2. In the else block, the condition for checking if `stdout` is not empty is not being handled properly.

The cause of the bug is that the if-else statement is not addressing all possible conditions, leading to incorrect results. 

To fix the bug, we need to handle the conditions properly in the if-else statement to ensure that the function returns the correct result.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test.
