## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By updating the comparison of the table name to be case insensitive and using the `bool` function to simplify the code, the corrected version of the buggy function resolves the issue reported in GitHub and passes the failing test.
