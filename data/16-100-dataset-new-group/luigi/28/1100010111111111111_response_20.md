The issue with the current function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the database. This causes the failing test cases, as the function does not handle case insensitivity correctly.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase for comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database="default", partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show tables like '{1}';".format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(
                database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)
            )
        )

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase using the `lower()` method, the function now performs a case-insensitive comparison.

The corrected function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
