The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of the table in the Hive database. This causes the tests to fail when the expected and actual table names don't match in case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner, preventing this issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case-insensitive. This ensures that the function will correctly identify the existence of the table regardless of the case used.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub (#896) and should resolve the failing tests as well.
