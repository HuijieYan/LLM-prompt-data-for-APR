Buggy function explanation: The `table_exists` function is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output. In the case of a partitioned table, it also calls the `partition_spec` function to obtain the partition specification.

Potential errors:
1. The condition for checking if a table exists using `run_hive_cmd` might not be correctly handling the output.
2. When checking for a partitioned table, the call to `run_hive_cmd` with the partition specification might not be formatted properly.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the conditional checks and how the output of the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions is being processed. In some cases, the conditional checks are not properly handling the stdout value returned by `run_hive_cmd`, leading to incorrect results.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Refactor the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function to properly handle the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Ensure that the call to `run_hive_cmd` with the partition specification is formatted correctly.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        # Check if stdout contains the table name
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Format the command to include the partition specification
        partition_str = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")
        
        # Check if stdout contains the partition
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks are improved to handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` properly. Additionally, the partition specification is formatted correctly before being passed to `run_hive_cmd`. This should address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
