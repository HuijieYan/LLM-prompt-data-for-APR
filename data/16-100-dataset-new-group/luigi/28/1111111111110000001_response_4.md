## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Lowercase both strings for case insensitivity
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Simply return the boolean value of stdout
```

The bug was due to case sensitivity in the table comparison. The `table_exists` function did not handle case insensitivity when checking the existence of a table, leading to failing tests. The corrected version modified the comparison to convert both strings to lowercase for case insensitivity. Additionally, it simplified the logic by directly returning the boolean value of `stdout` instead of using if-else conditions.

These changes will make the `table_exists` function case insensitive and pass the failing tests.
