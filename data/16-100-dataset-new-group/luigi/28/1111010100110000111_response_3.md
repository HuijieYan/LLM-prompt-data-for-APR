## Potential error locations
1. The if-else conditions in the `table_exists` function.
2. The comparison between the table name and the stdout string.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by inconsistency in case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive metadata. When a table name is passed to the `table_exists` function, it is compared with the stdout from the Hive command. However, the comparison is case-sensitive, leading to failing tests when the case of the table name doesn't match the case of the table in the Hive metadata.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the characters.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method and then performing the comparison, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
