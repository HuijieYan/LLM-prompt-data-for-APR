The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is case-sensitive, causing issues when checking for table existence in Hive. To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function now compares the table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before the comparison. This resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensures that the `table_exists` function works as expected in a case-insensitive manner.
