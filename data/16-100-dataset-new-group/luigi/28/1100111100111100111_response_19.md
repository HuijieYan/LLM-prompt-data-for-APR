The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be related to case-sensitivity. The function is not handling case-insensitive table names properly, leading to failing tests.

The issue is related to the fact that Hive is case-insensitive, so when checking for an existing table, the function should be case-insensitive as well. The failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly handling case sensitivity. The GitHub issue also confirms that this is an issue and suggests that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name (which may contain upper and lower case letters) with the values in `stdout` in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This version of the function compares the lowercased `table` with the lowercased `stdout`, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive. This should resolve the failing tests and address the case sensitivity issue.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function should now behave in a case-insensitive manner, as expected. This will address the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
