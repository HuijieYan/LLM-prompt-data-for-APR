The bug in the `table_exists` function is that there's a potential issue with the `stdout` variable that is being checked in the return statements. The function checks if `stdout` is not empty before returning `True`, but the check is not sufficient to handle all cases.

In some cases, the `stdout` may not contain the table name, but it is not an indication that the table does not exist. Similarly, in some cases, the `stdout` may not contain the partition, but it is not an indication that the partition does not exist.

To fix this bug, we should modify the return statements to directly return the boolean value based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, we should handle the case when the `stdout` is empty by explicitly checking for the presence of the table or partition name.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we directly return the boolean value of `bool(stdout)`, which will return True if `stdout` is not empty, and False otherwise. This should handle all cases effectively and fix the bug.
