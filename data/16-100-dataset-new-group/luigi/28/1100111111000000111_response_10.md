The buggy function is `table_exists` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database, but it fails case sensitivity. This bug is described in the GitHub issue #896 titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?".

The bug occurs because the function does not handle case insensitivity when checking if the table exists. When comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command, the function does not convert the names to lowercase for comparison, leading to a false negative if the case of the table name and the output do not match.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and the function will return the correct result.

Please find the corrected version of the function below:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function now converts both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive. This will resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the `table_exists` function pass the failing test cases in the `hive_test` file.
