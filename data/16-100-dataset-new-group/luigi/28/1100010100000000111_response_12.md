The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes issues when tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lowercase, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive, making the comparison case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase, and then we perform the comparison. This approach ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue.
