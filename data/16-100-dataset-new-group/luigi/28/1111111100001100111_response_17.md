### Cause of the bug
The bug causes the `table_exists` function to be case-sensitive, which leads to failing tests if the table names are different cases. The GitHub issue indicates that Hive is case-insensitive, meaning it returns table names in lowercase regardless of the case used in the query.

### Error location
The error is located in the comparison of the table name and the `stdout`. The comparison is case-sensitive, leading to failing tests.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case-insensitive by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
