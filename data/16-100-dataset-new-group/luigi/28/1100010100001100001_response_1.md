The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the logic of checking whether a table exists in a given database. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't. However, the implementation seems to be checking for the presence of the table name within the `stdout` output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This might not always produce the correct result, especially when the table name is also a substring of another table name.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the function to explicitly check for the existence of the table in the `stdout` output, rather than just checking for its presence anywhere in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function with the bug fixed:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
