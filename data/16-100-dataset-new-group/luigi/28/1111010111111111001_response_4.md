The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the return value not being correctly evaluated based on the `stdout` variable. It looks like the function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't.

The bug appears to be in the `else` branch of the `table_exists` function, where the condition for returning `True` or `False` is not being properly evaluated.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the condition in the `else` branch to properly return `True` or `False` based on the `stdout` variable.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```

This corrected version should properly evaluate the `stdout` variable and return `True` or `False` based on the table existence.
