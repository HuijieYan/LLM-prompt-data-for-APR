The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using incorrect logic and string comparisons, resulting in failing test cases. The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results for table existence checks.

The bug is primarily within the `table_exists` function. The first part of the function is attempting to check if a table exists in the given database by running a Hive command. However, it incorrectly evaluates the output of the command using the `stdout` variable and the `and` operator, which leads to incorrect results. The second part of the function is also not correctly handling the output from the Hive command.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to modify the logic within the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the output of the Hive commands and compare the results to determine if the table exists. This might involve checking the presence of the table name in the command output and also handling the case where the partition is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected logic, the updated function should correctly handle the output of the Hive commands and return the expected results for table existence checks. After applying this fix, the failing test cases should pass.
