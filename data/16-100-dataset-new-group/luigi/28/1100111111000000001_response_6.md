The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the incorrect logic when checking for the existence of a table with or without a partition. The function checks if the output from the `run_hive_cmd` is not empty to determine if the table exists, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to explicitly check for the existence of the table in the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version will split the output by newline and check if the table exists in the list of tables, or construct the partition string and check if the partition exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
