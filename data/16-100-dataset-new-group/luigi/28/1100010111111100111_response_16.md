In the provided code, the `table_exists` function is meant to check for the existence of a table in a Hive database. However, the function fails to handle case sensitivity correctly, causing the test cases to fail.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not handling case insensitivity as per the GitHub issue. The test cases are expecting the function to handle case insensitivity, but the function currently does not.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase for comparison. This will ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will perform a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table, as expected by the failing test cases. This fix will resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
