The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns `False` when it should return `True`. This is likely due to an issue with the conditional statements in the function. 

The bug appears to be in the conditional statement that checks if `stdout` is not empty. In the failing tests, `stdout` is not empty, but the function still returns `False`. This suggests that the conditional check is not working correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the conditional statements are properly evaluating the values of `stdout` and returning the correct boolean result.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty
```

In this corrected version, we use the `bool` function to explicitly convert `stdout` to a boolean value. This ensures that the function returns the correct boolean result based on the content of `stdout`. This should fix the bug and make the failing tests pass.
