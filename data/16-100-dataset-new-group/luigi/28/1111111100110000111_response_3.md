Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug lies in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The error message indicates that the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly, which aligns with the GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?".

The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function performing a case-sensitive comparison of the table name against the table names returned by the Hive command. As a result, when the function checks for the existence of a table with a name that has a different case, it fails.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name and the names returned by the Hive command to the same case (e.g., lower case) before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other class methods...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the table name and the names returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function have been converted to lower case before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive. This should resolve the issue and make the `table_exists` function pass the failing test.
