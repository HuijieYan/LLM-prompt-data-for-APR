The buggy function is `table_exists` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a database.

The main issue in the function is with the conditional statements that check if `stdout` is truthy or falsy. In the first part of the function, the `and` operator is used to check if `stdout` is not empty and if `table` is in `stdout`. 

In the second part of the function, the `if` statement checks if `stdout` is truthy and returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The failing test is indicating that the function is returning `False` when it should be returning `True` for the table existing in the database.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to correctly check whether the table exists in the database and return the appropriate boolean value.

Here is a possible corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(table, database))
        return table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
        return partition.lower() in [p.partition_spec.lower() for p in stdout.split('\n') if p]
```

In this corrected version, the function uses lowercase comparisons for both table names and partition specs, and it correctly splits the stdout into lines before checking for existance of the table or partition.
