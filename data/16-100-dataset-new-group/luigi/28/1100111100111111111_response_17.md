The buggy function `table_exists` fails to correctly determine if a table exists in the database. The issue arises from the case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This is in line with the GitHub issues titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The expected output is also provided in the failing tests to help in fixing the bug.

The cause of the bug is primarily due to case sensitivity. When the table name is compared with the output from the Hive command, the case insensitivity of Hive is not taken into account.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other methods ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check. This modification addresses the bug and aligns with the GitHub issues and the expected input/output values from the failing tests.
