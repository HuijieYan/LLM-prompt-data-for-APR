The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns `table in stdout` instead of `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, which causes the function to be case-sensitive, resulting in inconsistent behavior when comparing table names. This bug is addressed in the GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for the lowercase version of the table name in the lowercase version of the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
In this corrected version, the `table` name is converted to lowercase before being checked in the `stdout`, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive. The `bool` casting is also simplified for the `else` case.
