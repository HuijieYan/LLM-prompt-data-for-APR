The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be related to how the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called. The function tries to check if a table exists in the Hive database and the bug may be caused by the way the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The buggy function `table_exists` checks for a table in the database and incorrectly returns `False` if it finds "OK" in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It also incorrectly returns `False` when the table is found because of the condition `and table in stdout`. Additionally, the inner `else` statement is redundant and can be simplified.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the condition for checking the existence of the table in the database and to simplify the logic for returning the result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other class methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the return statements have been simplified, and the conditions for checking the existence of the table have been fixed to address the issues identified. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
