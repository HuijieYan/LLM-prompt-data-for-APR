To address the bug in the `table_exists` function, it seems that the issue is related to the output of the `run_hive_cmd` not being handled correctly. This is leading to inconsistent and incorrect responses when checking for the existence of a table.

The cause of the bug appears to be due to the function not processing the provided `run_hive_cmd` output properly. It is incorrectly evaluating the value of `stdout` which leads to the incorrect outcome for the existence of a table.

To fix this bug, the function should properly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to accurately determine the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            if database not in ['', 'default']:
                database = database + '.'
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}{2}'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

This corrected version includes proper handling of the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to ensure that the table existence check is accurately reported. This should address the output assertion issues.
