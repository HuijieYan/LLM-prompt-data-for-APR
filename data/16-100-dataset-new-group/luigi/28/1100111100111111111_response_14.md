The issue here is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The current implementation of the `table_exists` function does not account for case insensitivity, leading to failing tests in scenarios where the table names have different cases.

The fix is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lower case before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # No need to check if stdout is True or False
```

With this change, the comparison between the table name and the stdout from Hive is now case insensitive, resolving the failing tests and aligning with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
