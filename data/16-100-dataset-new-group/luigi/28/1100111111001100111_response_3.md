The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not case insensitive, causing the test cases to fail when checking for tables with different letter cases. The GitHub issue #896 also confirms this problem and suggests a fix to make the function case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing both the input table and the stdout in lowercase, we can ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, fixing the bug and making the function pass the failing test.
