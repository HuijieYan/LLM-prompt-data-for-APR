To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called correctly and that the logic for checking table existence is accurate. 

The bug appears to be in the way the `stdout` is checked to determine if the table exists. In both cases, the function is returning the opposite of what is expected. 

To fix this, we need to check if the `table` is found in the `stdout` for the first case, and for the second case, we need to return the opposite of whether `stdout` is empty or not.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout  # Check if the table is in the stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
