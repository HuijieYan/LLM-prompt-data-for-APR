The bug is likely located in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The error indicates that for both test cases where the return value is "OK\nmytable" and when the input is "MyTable", the function is returning False instead of True, which results in an AssertionError.

The bug occurs because when using `run_hive_cmd`, it might return results that require further processing to accurately check whether the table exists or not, especially considering case insensitivity with table names.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` method to cater to case insensitivity while checking the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            # Here, we use the lower() method to perform a case-insensitive check
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both table and stdout to lowercase, we ensure that the case insensitivity is properly handled while checking whether the table exists or not.
