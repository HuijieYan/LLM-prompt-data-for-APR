The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect logic used to check if a table or partition exists in the Hive database. The function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False` and vice versa.

The buggy logic is as follows:
- When no partition is specified, the function runs a Hive command to check if the table exists. If the table name is found in the stdout, it should return `True`, but the current logic is returning `True` only if stdout is not empty, which is incorrect.
- When a partition is specified, the function runs a Hive command to check if the partition exists. If stdout is not empty, it should return `True`, but the current logic is directly returning the stdout, which is incorrect.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the logic for checking table and partition existence needs to be revised. The condition for returning `True` and `False` needs to be based on whether the table or partition is actually found in the stdout, rather than simply based on whether the stdout is empty or not.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""
```

In the corrected version, for the case when no partition is specified, the stdout is split on the new line, and the function checks if the table name is in the split stdout. For the case when a partition is specified, the function directly returns whether the `stdout` is empty or not. This ensures that the function correctly checks for the existence of tables or partitions in the Hive database.
