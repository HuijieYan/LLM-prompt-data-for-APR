Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity, causing the test cases to fail when checking for existing tables in Hive. The issue on GitHub suggests that the fix should involve checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to handle case insensitivity. Here's the corrected version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the condition for checking if the table exists has been updated to use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, making it case insensitive. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub issue and should make the failing tests pass.
