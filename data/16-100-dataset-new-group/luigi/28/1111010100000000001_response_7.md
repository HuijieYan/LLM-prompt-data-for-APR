Explanation:
The buggy function "table_exists" is trying to determine if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug is caused by the incorrect use of SQL commands and string formatting in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to use the correct SQL commands to check for table existence and partitions. Additionally, we need to use the correct string formatting to include variables like database, table, and partition in the commands.

The corrected version of the function uses the correct SQL commands and string formatting to fix the bug, ensuring that it accurately determines if a table exists in the Hive database.
