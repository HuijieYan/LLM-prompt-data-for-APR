The bug in the function `table_exists` is due to the stdout comparison with the table name, which is case-sensitive. 

The issue on GitHub confirms that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence. The proposed fix includes checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues. 

To fix the bug, we will modify the function to convert both the `stdout` and `table` to lowercase and then perform the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `stdout` and `table` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
