The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it is case-sensitive, causing the test cases to fail. This issue was reported on GitHub with the title "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The issue is that the function incorrectly checks for an exact match of the table name in the `stdout` string, which can lead to case-sensitivity issues.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to check for the presence of the table name (in a case-insensitive manner) within the `stdout` string. We can achieve this using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and `stdout` string to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        stdout = ""
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we are using the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison, ensuring that the test cases will pass as expected. This will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `table_exists` function works as intended.
