The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function fails to check for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of hive commands, leading to incorrect results when the table names are not in the same case.

The failing test in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` demonstrates the issue by showing inconsistent results when checking for table existence with different case versions of table names.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the converted lowercase output of the hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now properly check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, as required by the GitHub issues.
