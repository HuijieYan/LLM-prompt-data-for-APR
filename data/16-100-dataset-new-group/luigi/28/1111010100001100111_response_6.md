The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `hive.py` module needs to be fixed to make the table existence check case insensitive.

The bug is caused by the fact that the table name and the query result are not being matched in a case-insensitive manner, leading to false negatives when checking for the existence of a table. The GitHub issue confirms this, indicating that the table names are case insensitive in Hive, and the function needs to be updated to reflect that.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the query result to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them for existence, ensuring that the check is case insensitive.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition.lower())))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the query result to lowercase before comparing, the issue of case insensitivity in the table existence check will be resolved.
