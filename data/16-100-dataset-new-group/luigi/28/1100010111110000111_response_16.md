## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The bug in the original function was that it did not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. By converting both the table and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method, we can perform a case-insensitive comparison and ensure that the table exists regardless of its casing.

This correction will resolve the failing tests and address the issue reported in the GitHub.
