The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive, leading to failing tests where the table name cases do not match the returned standard output (stdout) from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This bug is captured in two GitHub issues - one titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and the other titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". Both issues highlight the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to align with Hive's case insensitivity.

The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner when checking against the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The failing test cases reflect this issue, as they expect case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner against the stdout. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` function and then performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, which includes the necessary case-insensitive comparison:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case insensitive, addressing the bug and aligning with the expectations from the failing test cases and the corresponding GitHub issues.
