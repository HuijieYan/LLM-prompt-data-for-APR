The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it assumes the case of the table name in the `stdout` returned from the Hive command will match the case of the table name provided. However, Hive is case-insensitive, and it converts all table names to lowercase. This causes the function to incorrectly return `False` even when the table actually exists.

To fix this bug, the function needs to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the table names in `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.strip().split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database,table,self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function uses `map(str.lower, stdout.strip().split())` to convert the list of table names in `stdout` to lowercase, and then it checks if the lowercase version of the given table name is in the list.

This fix addresses both the failing tests and also follows the suggestion in the GitHub issue to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

After applying this fix, the function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
