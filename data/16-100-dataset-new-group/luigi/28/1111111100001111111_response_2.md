The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-sensitive. This causes issues when checking for table existence in Hive because Hive is case-insensitive and returns table names in lowercase.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive, using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected `table_exists` function now satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
