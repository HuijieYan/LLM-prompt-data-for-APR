The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function checks for an exact match between the table name and the table name in the stdout, leading to case sensitivity issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to check for a case-insensitive match between the table name and the table name in the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the table name in the `stdout` to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
- We return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, and `False` otherwise.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the GitHub issues related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
