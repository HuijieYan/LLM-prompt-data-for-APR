The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the fact that it doesn't properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function in the case when the table/partition exists. The current implementation checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty to determine if the table/partition exists, but this is not a reliable check.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional statements where the `stdout` variable is checked, and properly parse the output to determine if the table/partition exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return 'No such partition' not in stdout
```

In this corrected version:
- For the case where no partition is provided, the `show tables` command is used to obtain a list of tables, and then the function checks if the `table` variable is in the list.
- For the case where a specific partition is provided, a string representation of the partition is constructed and used in the `show partitions` command, and the function checks if the output contains "No such partition".

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing tests.
