Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    
```

Explanation:

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity of the table names obtained from Hive. The test failures indicate that the function is not handling the case of the table name properly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking if the table exists in the Hive output. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, we can make the comparison case-insensitive. This will ensure that the function returns the correct result regardless of the case of the table name.

By modifying the return statement to `return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we can ensure that the function is case-insensitive and will pass the failing tests.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is included in the code snippet above. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
