The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function does not account for the case sensitivity of the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This change aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue.
