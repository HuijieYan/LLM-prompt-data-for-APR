Based on the error messages from the failing tests and the GitHub issues, it seems that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive and does not handle cases where table names are in different cases. The suggested fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        table_lower = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
    
            return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower() # Check against lowercase stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table_lower, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Just return the boolean value of stdout
    
```

This corrected version ensures that the table name is converted to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout` output. This should fix the case sensitivity issue.
