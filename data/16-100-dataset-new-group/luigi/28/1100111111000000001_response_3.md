There are a few potential errors in the `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class. 

1. The first conditional statement is checking if stdout is truthy AND if the table is in the stdout. This means that if stdout is an empty string, the function will still return True if the table is in stdout, which is incorrect.
2. The second conditional statement is not handling the case if the `run_hive_cmd` function returns an empty string. It only checks the truthiness of stdout, which might not be correct.

To fix the bug:
- Adjust the first conditional statement to check if stdout is not empty AND if the table is in the stdout.
- Update the second conditional statement to explicitly check if stdout is not empty.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout.strip() != "" and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
