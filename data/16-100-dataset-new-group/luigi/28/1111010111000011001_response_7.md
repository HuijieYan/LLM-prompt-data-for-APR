To fix the buggy function, let's first analyze the function and its relationship with the test code and the expected input/output values.

The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in a given database, with an optional partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute hive commands and check the output. However, there are issues with how the function handles the partition parameter and how it checks for the existence of the table.

In the failing test, the function is expected to return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not, with additional cases for case insensitivity and partitions.

The cause of the bug is that the function returns `True` or `False` based on whether `stdout` is empty, which doesn't accurately represent the existence of the table.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to return `True` if the table exists in the output, and `False` if it doesn't.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});"""
                              .format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In the corrected version, the function checks if the table is in the output (for non-partitioned tables), and it checks if the output is not empty for partitioned tables. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
