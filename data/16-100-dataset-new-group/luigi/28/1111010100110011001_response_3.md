Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() == 'OK'
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() == 'OK\n{0}'.format(table)

```

Explanation:
- The bug was caused by the incorrect comparison of the `stdout` variable with the expected values. The previous implementation did not handle the newline character properly.
- The corrected version of the function uses the `strip()` method to remove leading and trailing white spaces, including the newline character.
- This strategy ensures that the comparison of `stdout` with the expected values is accurate, regardless of any additional whitespace characters.

By using this corrected version of the function, the failing test cases are expected to pass, satisfying the expected input/output values.
