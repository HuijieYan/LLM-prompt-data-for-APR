1. The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is responsible for checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparisons between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command, as well as the handling of partitions.
3. The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case sensitive, leading to failures when the table names are capitalized. This is mentioned in the GitHub issue, where the suggestion is to make the comparison case insensitive.
4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
    - Modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing.
    - Account for the partition handling as well to ensure it works correctly in both cases.
5. Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before performing the comparison, making it case insensitive. Additionally, the partition handling is simplified to directly return the boolean value based on the `stdout`.
