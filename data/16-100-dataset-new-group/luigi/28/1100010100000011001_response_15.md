The buggy function has a few potential error locations, including:
1. The use of run_hive_cmd function is not defined within the buggy function.
2. The logic of how the stdout variable is checked for the existence of the table.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly checking the stdout for the existence of the table. It only checks if the stdout is not empty or not None, which may not be the correct way to determine if the table exists.

To fix the bug, we need to define the run_hive_cmd function or import it from a proper module. Then, we need to properly parse the stdout to check for the existence of the table.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout.strip())
```
