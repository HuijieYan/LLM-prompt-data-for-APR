To fix the bug, we need to replace the line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
with:
```python
return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```
This will make the comparison case insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue. Additionally, the method should also be updated to handle the partition parameter correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the buggy function, now corrected
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_spec_str = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_spec_str))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
