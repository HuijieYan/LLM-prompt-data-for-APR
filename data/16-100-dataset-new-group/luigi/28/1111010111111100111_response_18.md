The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive. This causes the failing test cases to produce incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking for table existence. In the failing test case, a table with mixed case ("MyTable") is checked, and the function returns incorrect results due to the case mismatch. This is consistent with the GitHub issues where it is mentioned that Hive is case insensitive, and the function should consider case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this change, the function will compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command, making the comparison case insensitive. This should resolve the failing test cases and address the GitHub issues related to case insensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
