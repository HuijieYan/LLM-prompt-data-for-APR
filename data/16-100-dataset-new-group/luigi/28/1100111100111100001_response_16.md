The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the case-insensitive check for table existence correctly. The function is using `in` to check if the table name is present in the `stdout`, which will return True even if the table name is found in the middle of a line, causing a false positive.

To fix the bug, we need to split the `stdout` by newline and then perform a case-sensitive check for the table name.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This version of the function splits the `stdout` by newline and checks if any of the table names in `stdout` are equal to the input table name in a case-insensitive manner. The partition check also returns a boolean based on whether `stdout` is empty or not. This should address the issues with case-insensitive table name checks and faulty partition checking.
