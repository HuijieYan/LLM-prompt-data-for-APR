Since the buggy function `table_exists` is not case insensitive, it fails for the test cases when the table name is in different cases. This issue has been identified in the GitHub issues with ID 896.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when comparing table names with the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function will now return `True` if the table exists in the database regardless of cases and `False` if it doesn't exist. This will ensure that the test cases pass and the issue reported on GitHub is resolved.
