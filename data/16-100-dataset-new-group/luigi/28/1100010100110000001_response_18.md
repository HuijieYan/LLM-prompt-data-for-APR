The issue in this buggy function is related to the if-else statement. When no partition is specified, the function checks if the table exists using a specific command and returns the result. However, when a partition is specified, the function attempts to check if the partition exists using a different command but the logic is flawed.

The cause of the bug is that the function always returns True when checking the status of the partitions, regardless of whether the partition actually exists or not. This causes the tests to fail when trying to verify the existence of the table or partition, leading to incorrect assertions.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` and determine if the table or partition exists based on the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, for the else block, we use the provided commands to retrieve the partitions and then simply convert the `stdout` value to a boolean by applying the `bool()` function. This will correctly check if the partition exists based on the `stdout` value and fix the bug.
