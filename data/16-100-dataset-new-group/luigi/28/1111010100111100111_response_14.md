The bug in the `table_exists` function causes it to be case-sensitive, leading to test failures. The issue is known and discussed on GitHub, where the proposed solution is to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive. This involves modifying the function logic to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to use case-insensitive comparison. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```
