The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the `stdout` variable not being handled properly in the second part of the `if` statement when `partition` is not None. In this case, the function calls `run_hive_cmd` with a formatted string, which includes a call to `self.partition_spec(partition)`. This seems to be incorrect and could be causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the call to `self.partition_spec(partition)` returns the correct partition specification string before passing it to `run_hive_cmd`. Additionally, it might be necessary to adjust the conditional check on `stdout` to correctly determine whether the table exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = " and ".join("{} = '{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items())
            cmd = "use {}; show partitions {}.{} where {}".format(database, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we construct the partition specification string from the `partition` dictionary and use it to build the `cmd` string for `run_hive_cmd`. The standard output check is simplified to directly return the boolean evaluation of `stdout`. This should address the issue and ensure the function operates correctly.
