The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when comparing table names, leading to incorrect return values and failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is this line of code:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
The comparison of `table in stdout` is case sensitive, which causes the failing test cases when the case of the table name doesn't match the case of the table name in `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing, the function will now be case insensitive and correctly handle the table existence check.

This corrected version passes the failing test cases and satisfies the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
