The bug in the `table_exists` function is failing to return the correct value due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing table names. The function currently uses the `in` operator to check the existence of a table in the `stdout`, which causes problems when dealing with case-sensitive table names.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function uses the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison using the `in` operator. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the issue reported in GitHub.

Additionally, the `bool()` function is used to return a boolean value directly from `stdout` when checking for the existence of a partition.

With these changes, the corrected `table_exists` function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue of making the table existence check case-insensitive.
