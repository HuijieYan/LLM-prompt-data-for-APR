The buggy function has an issue with case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function compares the table name directly with the stdout, which may result in a case mismatch. This issue has already been reported on GitHub as issue #896 and a recommended fix is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, comparing the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive when checking for table existence. We also need to update the `run_hive_cmd` function to return the table names in lowercase.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
    
            return bool(stdout)

```

With the given fix, the function now compares the lowercase version of the table name and the stdout, making the comparison case insensitive as per the suggestion in the GitHub issue. This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
