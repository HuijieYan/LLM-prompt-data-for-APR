The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns the opposite of what is expected. When stdout is not empty, it should return True, and when it is empty, it should return False. This is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to change the logic in the function to return True when `stdout` is not empty, and return False when it is empty. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, and False if it is empty
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, and False if it is empty
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass all the test cases provided.
