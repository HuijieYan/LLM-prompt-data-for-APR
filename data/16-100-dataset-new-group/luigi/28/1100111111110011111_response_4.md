To fix the bug, we need to address the case sensitivity issue as reported in the GitHub issue. The `table_exists` function should check the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version makes use of the `lower()` method to compare the table name with the table names present in the stdout in a case-insensitive manner. This fixes the issue reported in the failing tests and addresses the GitHub issues #896 and #897.

Please note that the `partition_spec` function was not provided, so we are assuming that it returns the correct partition information as required by the `table_exists` function. If there are any issues with the `partition_spec` function, they should be addressed separately.
