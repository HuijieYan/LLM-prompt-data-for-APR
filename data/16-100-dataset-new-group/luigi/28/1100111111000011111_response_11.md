To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `stdout` and the `table` to lowercase and then performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass all the test cases, including the one for case insensitivity, and satisfy the expected input/output values. This correction also addresses the issue reported on GitHub (#896) about making `table_exists` case insensitive.

By converting both `stdout` and `table` to lowercase before comparing them, we ensure that the comparison is not sensitive to the case of the table names, resolving the bug and the related GitHub issue.
