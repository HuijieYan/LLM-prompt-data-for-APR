The potential error location in the buggy code is in the `table_exists` function. The bug is causing the test cases in the `test_table_exists` to fail because the function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing table names.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not case insensitive when comparing table names with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase and compare it with the lowercase `stdout` to make the comparison case insensitive.

Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this modification, the table name is converted to lowercase before being compared with the lowercase `stdout`, which satisfies the case insensitivity requirement mentioned in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
