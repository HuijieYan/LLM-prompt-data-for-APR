The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function is used to check if a given table exists in the specified Hive database and optionally check for a specific partition.

The potential errors in the `table_exists` function could be related to the condition checks and the commands being run using `run_hive_cmd`. In the first condition, the check for `stdout` and table in `stdout` may not correctly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. In the second condition, the command being run using `run_hive_cmd` might not be formatted correctly or might not be handling the partition correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` and may not be handling the partition condition accurately, leading to incorrect table existence checks.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function correctly processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` and also handles the partition condition accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partitions = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
        partition_exists = any(partition.items() <= dict(kv.split('=') for kv in part.split('/')) for part in partitions.split('\n'))

        return partition_exists
```

By splitting the `stdout` and `partitions` strings by newline and processing them accordingly, we can accurately check for the existence of the table and its partitions. This corrected version should address the issues with the original buggy function.
