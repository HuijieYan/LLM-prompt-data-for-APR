The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test case when comparing table names in a case-sensitive manner. This is leading to the `AssertionError: False is not true` error during the test.

The root cause of the bug is the comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner, while the test is checking for case insensitivity. The GitHub issue #896 also specifies that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to modify the comparison logic to be case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()

    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table_lower, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we are converting the input table name to lowercase using `table_lower = table.lower()` and then performing comparisons against the lowercase table name throughout the function. This will ensure that the `table_exists` function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table, as expected.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
