The potential error locations within the buggy function include the use of the `run_hive_cmd` function without importing it and the incorrect formatting of the query string in the else block.

The cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being used without being imported or defined within the `HiveCommandClient` class. This will result in a NameError when the function is called.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be properly imported or defined within the class. Additionally, the formatting of the query string in the else block needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)

    def run_hive_cmd(self, query):
        # Implementation of the run_hive_cmd function
        pass
```

In this corrected version, I assumed that the `run_hive_cmd` function is a method within the class that handles the invocation of the hive commands. If it is an external function, it should be properly imported. Additionally, the query strings are formatted using the `format` method for consistency.
