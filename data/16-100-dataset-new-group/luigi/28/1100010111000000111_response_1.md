Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug is that the `table_exists` function is case sensitive, but it should be case insensitive because Hive is case insensitive. The fix should involve checking the stdout against the lower case of the table name. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
