The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test cases and generating AssertionError. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the returned output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which doesn't align with the expected behavior.

The buggy function returns `False` when it should actually return `True`. This is evident from the error message, such as "AssertionError: False is not true" at specific lines in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the conditions for returning `True` and `False` within the `table_exists` function need to be adjusted based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for returning `True` and `False` have been simplified using a ternary operator and `bool(stdout)` to check if the returned value from `run_hive_cmd` is not empty. This ensures that the function returns the expected value based on the actual output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
