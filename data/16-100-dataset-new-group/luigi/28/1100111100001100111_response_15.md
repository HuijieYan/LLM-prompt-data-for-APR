The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. The issue has been identified and discussed on GitHub, and the proposed solution is to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

The fix for the bug would be to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the comparison case-insensitive. This addresses the bug and aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.
