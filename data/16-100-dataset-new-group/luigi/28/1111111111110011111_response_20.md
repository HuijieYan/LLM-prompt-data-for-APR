To fix the bug, we need to modify the table_exists function in the HiveCommandClient class in the luigi/contrib/hive.py file. The issue is that the function doesn't handle case sensitivity properly. The function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner, as Hive is case insensitive.

The fix involves modifying the table_exists function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is not case sensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    ...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This fix will ensure that the table name comparison is case insensitive and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
