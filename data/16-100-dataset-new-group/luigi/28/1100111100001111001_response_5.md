The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a given database, possibly with a specified partition. The function makes a call to the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.

After analyzing the runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values, it appears that the bug in the function is due to the conditional logic and usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function seems to incorrectly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and does not process it correctly.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for checking the existence of the table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be updated.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec_str = ' and '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec_str})')
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. For the case where the partition is not specified, the function executes a Hive command to check for the existence of the table in the specified database by using the `show tables` command.
2. For the case where the partition is specified, the function constructs the partition specification string and uses it to execute a Hive command to check for the existence of the specified partition for the table.

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the expected boolean values indicating whether the table or partition exists.
