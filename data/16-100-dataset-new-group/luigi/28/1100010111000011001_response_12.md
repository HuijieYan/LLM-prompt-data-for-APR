## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table  # Check if table exists in the stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```

### Explanation
The bug in the original function lies in the handling of the `stdout` variable. In the first branch, the function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout`, but it fails to account for the possibility of additional whitespace characters or newlines that may be present in the `stdout`.

In the second branch, the function only checks if `stdout` is non-empty, but it should also consider the actual content of `stdout` to determine if the table exists.

To fix the bug, the corrected function uses the `strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace characters and then compares the cleaned `stdout` with the `table` in the first branch. In the second branch, it simply checks if `stdout` is not empty.

### This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
