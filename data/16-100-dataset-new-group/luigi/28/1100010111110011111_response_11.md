The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case-insensitive comparison of table names, leading to test failures when the input table name has different cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name directly with the stdout without considering the case sensitivity. When the table names have different cases, the comparison fails, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison to ensure a case-insensitive match.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout, which resolves the issue of failing tests when table names have different cases. This also addresses the GitHub issue #896 "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".
