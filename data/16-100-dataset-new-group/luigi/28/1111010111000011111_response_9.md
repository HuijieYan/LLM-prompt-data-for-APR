The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not check for case insensitivity in the table name comparison, leading to test failures when the case of the table name does not match. The expected behavior is that the function should be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the table names returned from Hive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to check for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. We can use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass all the test cases provided and resolve the issue posted on GitHub. It now considers case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
