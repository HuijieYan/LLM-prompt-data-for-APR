To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` to be case insensitive. If the table name is 'FooBar', the `stdout` returned by Hive will be 'foobar' and the test will fail. This happens because Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase. 

To address this issue, we can modify the comparison to check if the lowercase version of the table name is in the lowercase version of the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By using the lowercase versions for comparison, we ensure that the table name is matched case-insensitively with the table names returned by Hive.

This correction will fix the failing test case and address the issue described in the GitHub posts.
