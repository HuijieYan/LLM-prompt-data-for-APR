The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does a case-sensitive check when it should be case-insensitive. The GitHub issue sheds light on this problem and suggests a fix by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the `table` name with the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison, resolving the case sensitivity issue described in the GitHub issue.
