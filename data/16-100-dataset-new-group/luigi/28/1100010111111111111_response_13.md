To fix the bug in the `table_exists` method, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case insensitive. The fix involves converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we have ensured that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is done in a case-insensitive manner. This fix will address the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it will resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` method.
