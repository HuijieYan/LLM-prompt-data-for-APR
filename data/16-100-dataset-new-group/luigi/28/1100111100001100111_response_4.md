The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, which can result in case sensitivity issues. The GitHub issues indicate that the output from Hive is in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail when the table name is in uppercase or mixed case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to compare case-insensitively and also convert the table name to lowercase before the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before the comparison, making the comparison case-insensitive. This approach fixes the issue described in the GitHub issues.
