The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing failing tests because it does not correctly handle the output and comparison of the table existence check. The function attempts to execute a Hive command to check if a table exists in the given database, and is supposed to return `True` if the table exists, otherwise `False`.

The bug occurs when analyzing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the first case, the function correctly retrieves the output "OK" but then incorrectly returns `False`. In the second case, the function is provided with the table name in uppercase, but the function fails to recognize it as the same table and also returns `False`.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the comparison of the stdout with the table name to ensure it is case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly handles case-insensitive comparisons.
