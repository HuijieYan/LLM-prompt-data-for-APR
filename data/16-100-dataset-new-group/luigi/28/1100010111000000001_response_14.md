The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. In the first if condition where it checks if the partition is None.
2. In the second else condition where it checks if the stdout is empty.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that it does not handle the stdout correctly. In the first if condition, it checks if stdout is not empty and if the table exists, which is correct. However, in the else condition, it only checks if stdout is not empty, but it should also check if the table exists.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the logic within the else condition to correctly check if the table exists based on the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty and return True if it is not empty
```
