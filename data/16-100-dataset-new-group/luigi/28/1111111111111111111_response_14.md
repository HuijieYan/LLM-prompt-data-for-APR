The root cause of the bug is that the table name is not being compared in a case-insensitive manner. This causes the `table_exists` function to return incorrect results when the table exists but has a different case in the database. 

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them using the `lower()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this change, the comparison between the table name and the stdout will be done in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected and passes the failing tests.
