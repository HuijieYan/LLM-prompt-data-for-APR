Based on the error messages and expected values, it seems that the bug is causing the function to return the wrong value when checking for the existence of a table in the database. The issue seems to be related to how the function processes the `stdout` variable and its comparison to the table name.

The bug is located in the `table_exists` function. It is failing to handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly, leading to incorrect return values. Specifically, the bug occurs in the `if partition is None` block where the stdout is processed and compared to the table name.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the failing test cases, the expected `stdout` values are not being handled properly when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `stdout` variable is correctly processed and the table name is properly compared to it.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected version, we handle the `stdout` variable correctly and compare the table name to it for both cases when partition is None and when it is not. This should address the bug and make the function return the correct values according to the failing test cases.
