The buggy function is failing to properly check if a table exists in the database because it is not accounting for case sensitivity. This was also reported as GitHub issue #896, where the expected behavior is for the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

The bug appears to be due to the function not accounting for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. The failing test cases confirm this, as they specifically test for case insensitivity.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the output from Hive, also in lowercase.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases, account for case insensitivity when checking for table existence, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
