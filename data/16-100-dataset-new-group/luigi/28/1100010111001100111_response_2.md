The buggy function in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` fails the test case because it does not handle case-insensitive comparisons for the table names. The test case checks for the existence of tables with different casing (e.g., "mytable" and "MyTable"), and the function does not handle this scenario correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function will compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison. This corrected version will resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing tests.
