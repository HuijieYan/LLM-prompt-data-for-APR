The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function is not correctly handling the command output when checking for table existence in the Hive database.

The problem arises from the way the `stdout` is being checked for presence of the table name. In the first case, `stdout` is only checked for truthiness, and in the subsequent cases, a non-empty `stdout` is always returning `True`, which leads to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for a more accurate verification of table existence for each case.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')  # check if the table is in the list of tables from stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(partition in item for item in stdout.split('\n'))  # check if partition is in the list of partitions in stdout
```

By splitting the `stdout` and checking if the table or partition is in the resulting list, we ensure that the correct check is performed for table existence in the Hive database.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
