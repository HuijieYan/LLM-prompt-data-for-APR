The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is returning incorrect values - `False` instead of `True` for the first test case, and Assertion Error for the second test case.

The cause of the bug is due to the mishandling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function incorrectly checks for the existence of the table in the output, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly parse the output of `run_hive_cmd` and check for the existence of the table. We also need to ensure that the conditions for the `if` and `else` blocks are properly handled to return the correct results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected version, we handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly and check for the existence of the table in the output. This should address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
