The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This issue has been reported on GitHub and it is suggested that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

The cause of the bug is that the function performs a direct comparison between the table name and the output from Hive, without considering the case of the table name. This leads to false negatives when the table name has a different case in the Hive database.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the table name and the Hive output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison, ensuring that the check for table existence is case insensitive. This addresses the issue reported on GitHub and makes the `table_exists` function more robust.
