The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the fact that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This issue is highlighted in GitHub issue #896, which discusses making the `table_exists` function case insensitive for better compatibility with Hive's case insensitivity.

The cause of the bug can be identified by the failing test cases which are not accounting for case insensitivity. The `table_exists` function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the outputs from the Hive command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the outputs from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, the `table_exists` function uses `lower()` to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

With this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix addresses the case insensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue, making the function more compatible with Hive's behavior.
