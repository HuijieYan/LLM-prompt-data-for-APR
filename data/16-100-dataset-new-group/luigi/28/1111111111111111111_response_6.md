The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function only checks if the table name is in the result of the Hive command, but it does not account for case differences, which causes the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of the table in the Hive database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))

        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table_lower, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we convert the table name to lowercase and then perform the checks. This change makes the function case insensitive when checking for the existence of the table in the Hive database.

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. The GitHub issue related to this bug (#896) has also been addressed by making the function case insensitive.
