The buggy function `table_exists` is failing due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name from the `run_hive_cmd` output with the actual table name. This issue was reported on GitHub and there is a proposed fix to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name from the output with a lowercase version of the input table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
- In the first branch of the `if` statement, we use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to check if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner.
- In the second branch, we don't need to explicitly check for `stdout` content, as the presence of output alone is enough to return `True`.

With this change, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issues.
