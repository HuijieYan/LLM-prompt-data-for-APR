The bug in the function `table_exists` is in the logic for checking if a table exists in a database. The bug is due to the incorrect interpretation of the output `stdout` from the Hive command.

The bug is present in the `table_exists` function in the handling of `stdout` variable and the condition used to determine if the table exists or not.

The expected logic should be to check if the table name exactly matches with any line in the `stdout` output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to split the `stdout` by a newline character and then check if the exact table name is present in the list of tables.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
