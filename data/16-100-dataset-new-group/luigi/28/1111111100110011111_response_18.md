The problem in the `table_exists` function seems to be with table case sensitivity, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function does not handle case insensitivity and returns a boolean based on an exact match of the table name in the stdout. To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to use a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and stdout to lowercase before making the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected function, we first convert both the table name and stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method before making the comparison. This ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive.

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. The fix also aligns with the discussion in the GitHub issue and meets the intent of the code contributor's proposed solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
