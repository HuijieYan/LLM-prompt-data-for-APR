Based on the runtime values and the expected values, it seems that the issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity correctly. The function should be able to handle the case where the table name is provided in different cases (e.g. "mytable" and "MyTable").

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle case insensitivity. We can convert both the table name and the output from `stdout` to lowercase when checking for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout.lower().strip() == table.lower()
```

This corrected version should now handle case insensitivity and pass the failing tests.
