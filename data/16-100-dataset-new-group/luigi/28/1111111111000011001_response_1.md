The bug in the `table_exists` function is that when the `stdout` is not empty, it should be verified if the table is present in the stdout. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` does not verify that the table is present in the `stdout`. Additionally, in the case where the `partition` is not None, the function is not properly formatting the command to check if the partition exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions for checking if the table exists and format the command properly to check if the partition exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ", ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_str))
            
            return bool(stdout)  # Only need to return the boolean value of stdout
```

By making these adjustments, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
