Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function, it seems that the bug is caused by the table existence check being case sensitive, while Hive is case insensitive. This leads to issues when checking for tables that are defined with different case styles.

To fix the bug, we should modify the table existence check to be case insensitive and compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we are using `table.lower()` to convert the table name to lowercase and then using `map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))` to convert each line in the stdout to lowercase for a case-insensitive check. This approach ensures that table existence is checked in a case-insensitive manner, as required by the GitHub issue.
