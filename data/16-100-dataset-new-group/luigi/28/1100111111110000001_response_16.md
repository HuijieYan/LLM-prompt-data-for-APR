The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test due to incorrect comparison of the table existence in a database and partition. 

The cause of the bug lies in the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function, where it incorrectly processes the output of `run_hive_cmd` and checks for the presence of the table in the output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be corrected to correctly check the presence of the table in the output string returned by `run_hive_cmd`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table  # Correctly check for the presence of the table in the output
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())  # Check for the presence of any output in the stdout
```

With the corrected comparison logic, the function should now pass the failing test.
