The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly checking for table existence in the specified database when a partition is provided. 

Upon analysis of the failing tests, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the case when the input table names have different cases. This is likely causing the function to return incorrect results and fail the tests.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison of table names to be case-insensitive and ensure that the correct table name is being extracted from the stdout when a partition is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}"'.format(database, database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return any(partition.values() <= dict([x.split('=') for x in line.split('/')]) for line in stdout.split())
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
