The buggy function has a few issues that need to be addressed:
1. The first issue is in the `table_exists` function where it expects the `run_hive_cmd` function to return a specific format string. However, the mock for `run_hive_cmd` is returning a different format, causing the function to fail.
2. The second issue is with the logic inside the `table_exists` function. It's checking for the presence of the table in a case-sensitive manner, which causes issues when the table name is provided in a different case.

To fix the bug, we need to address both of these issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        partition_filter = " and ".join("{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items())
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_filter))

        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation of the corrections:
1. In the first block, we modified the query to `show tables` without specifying the table name condition. Then, we convert both the stdout and table name to lowercase and check for the table's presence.
2. In the second block, we constructed the partition filter using the provided partition data and checked for the presence of the partitions using a boolean conversion.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
