The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the test case insensitivity for table names. The problem arises when checking for table existence, as uppercase names are not being treated the same as lowercase names due to a missing case-insensitive comparison.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase and then check for existence. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the issue raised in GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this modified version, the `table_exists` function is now case-insensitive, and the failing test case should pass. Additionally, the reported GitHub issue #896 will be resolved with this fix.
