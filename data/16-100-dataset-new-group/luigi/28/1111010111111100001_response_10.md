The issue with the `table_exists` function seems to be the way it's handling the `stdout` variable and checking for the existence of a table in the output. The function is using `stdout and table in stdout` to check if the table exists, which is incorrect since `stdout` is always a truthy value because it's a string, and `table in stdout` may not work as expected.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for checking if the table exists in the `stdout` output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)});')
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We use `stdout.splitlines()` to split the output of the command into separate lines.
- For the case where `partition` is not `None`, we use `bool(stdout)` to check if stdout has any output, returning `True` if it does, and `False` if it doesn't.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing tests.
