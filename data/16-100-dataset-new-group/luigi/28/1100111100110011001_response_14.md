The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition for checking the existence of a table is not being properly handled when the function `run_hive_cmd` returns a string containing the table name.

The code currently checks for the presence of the table name within the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, when the table exists, the string returned contains the word "OK" before the table name. This causes the conditional check to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the existence of the table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # Simpler way to return True if stdout is not empty, otherwise False
```

In this corrected version, we utilize the `bool` function to directly convert `stdout` to a Boolean value. This assumes that the presence of any content in `stdout` indicates that the table exists, and an empty `stdout` indicates that the table does not exist.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
