## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the provided function, there are issues with the logic of obtaining the table existence and the handling of the partition parameter. The function returns incorrect results due to incorrect condition checking and the way the partition is being handled.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the partition parameter and the logic inside the else block. When dealing with a partition, the bug does not properly handle the query that checks for partitions. The incorrect handling leads to a failure to identify the presence of the table or partition.

To fix the bug, the function should utilize the proper Hive command syntax to check for the existence of a table or partition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_query = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_query})")
        return bool(stdout)
```
