Fixed Version:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the fixed function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the fixed function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the fixed version, I modified the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, making it case insensitive. I also simplified the check by using `bool(stdout)` directly instead of the conditional statements. This should resolve the issues reported in the failing tests and the corresponding GitHub issues.
