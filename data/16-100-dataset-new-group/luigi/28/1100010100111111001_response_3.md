Based on the error messages and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug is related to how the function handles the `table` parameter when checking for its existence.

The buggy function does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of the table, leading to inconsistent results. Additionally, there is an issue with the `show partitions` command when a `partition` is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table` comparison is case-insensitive and handle the `partition` command properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We use the `lower()` method to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
- We handle the `partition` command and return the result directly without using an if-else statement.
- We also use the `bool()` function to convert the `stdout` value to a boolean directly.
