The bug in the `table_exists` function is that when `stdout` is checked to determine if the table exists, it only checks if the table name is present in the `stdout` string, but it doesn't consider if the table is the exact match or if there are any other characters present in the `stdout` which could lead to incorrect results. Additionally, when a partition is specified, the function doesn't use the `partition_spec` function correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to properly check for table existence in the `stdout` and to correctly use the `partition_spec` function when a partition is specified. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions in the class

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            partition_clause = " AND ".join(["{}='{}'".format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, table, partition_clause))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function now correctly splits the `stdout` by newline character to check for exact table name matches when no partition is specified. Additionally, it constructs the partition clause accurately when a partition is specified.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
