The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, leading to case sensitivity issues. This is evidenced by the failing tests and the GitHub issue that requests that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the failing tests and the issue raised on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method, and then compared using the `in` operator. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and the function works as intended.

With this correction, the failing tests that check for case insensitivity of `table_exists` function should pass, and the issue raised on GitHub about making the function case insensitive will be addressed.
