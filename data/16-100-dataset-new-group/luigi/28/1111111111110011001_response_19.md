The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is not handling the case where the `table` name is a substring of another table name in the output. This causes the incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists or not.

To fix this bug, we should split the `stdout` string by newline characters and then check if the exact `table` name is in the list of tables.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other class functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function splits the `stdout` string by newline characters and then checks if the exact `table` name is in the list of tables. This ensures that we are matching the table name exactly and not as a substring of another table name.

With this fix, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
