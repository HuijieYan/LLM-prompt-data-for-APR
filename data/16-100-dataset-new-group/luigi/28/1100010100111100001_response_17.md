The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns the opposite boolean value that is expected. In the first if-else block, when `partition` is `None`, the function returns the opposite value of what is intended. In the second if-else block, it returns the boolean value found in `stdout`, which also seems to be the opposite of what is expected in this context.

The correct implementation should return `True` when the table/partition exists and `False` when it does not. Therefore, in the first if-else block, when `partition` is `None`, the function should check if `table in stdout` and return `True` if so, and in the second if-else block, it should return the opposite (`not`) of what is currently being returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return not (not stdout)
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly return `True` when the table/partition exists and `False` when it does not. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
