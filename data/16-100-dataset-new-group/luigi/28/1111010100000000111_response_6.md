## Analysis:
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive, as Hive is case insensitive.

## Potential error locations:
The error may be in the comparison of the table name with the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison of the table name with the output of `run_hive_cmd` without considering case sensitivity. If the table name is in a different case than the output of `run_hive_cmd`, the function will fail to accurately determine if the table exists.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` needs to be made case insensitive.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
