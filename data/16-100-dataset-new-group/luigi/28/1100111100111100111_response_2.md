The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test cases to result in incorrect outcomes. The issue is due to the function not being case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. The bug is also related to GitHub issue #896, which requests making `table_exists` case insensitive.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional checks for `table in stdout`. The comparison is case sensitive, which leads to incorrect results.

The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function's failure to convert the table name to lowercase before performing a case-insensitive comparison with the table names from the `run_hive_cmd` output. This leads to inconsistent and incorrect outputs, as observed in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the strategy involves modifying the `table_exists` function to convert the input table name to lowercase before comparing it with the table names from the `run_hive_cmd` output. By doing so, the function will be case insensitive, addressing the issue reported in GitHub and ensuring consistent and correct outputs.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other class functions

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        table = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.lower()  # Compare lowercase table name with lowercase stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

            return bool(stdout)  # Simply return the boolean result of the stdout check
```

By modifying the function to convert the table name to lowercase and performing a case-insensitive comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures that the tests will pass and that the function will be insensitive to the case of the table names.
