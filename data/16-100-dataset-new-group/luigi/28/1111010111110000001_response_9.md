The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it returns the opposite boolean value as expected, causing all the test cases to fail.

This is happening because when the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the expected output, the function should return `True`, but it returns `False`, and vice versa. This is due to the flawed logic in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the `table_exists` function to return the correct boolean value based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The fixed version of the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the return values in the `table_exists` function, it will now correctly return `True` when the expected output is received from `run_hive_cmd`, and return `False` when there is no output. This should resolve the issue and make all the test cases pass.
