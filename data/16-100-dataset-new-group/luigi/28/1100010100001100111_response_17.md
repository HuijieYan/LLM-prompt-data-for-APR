The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the case sensitivity of the table name. The GitHub issue indicates that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them in lowercase, causing the function to fail when checking for the existence of the table.

The bug appears to be in the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive. The function needs to check if the lowercase version of the table name exists within the lowercase version of the output from Hive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison statement to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive, making it case insensitive. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive, the function will be able to handle case insensitive comparisons, fixing the bug related to capitalized table names.
