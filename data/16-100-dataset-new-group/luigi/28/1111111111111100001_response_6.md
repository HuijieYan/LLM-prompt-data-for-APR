The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the condition checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The `table_exists` function appears to be returning the incorrect output due to the way it is handling the `stdout` variable.

The primary issue seems to be with the handling of the `stdout` variable in the `table_exists` function. In both the if and else blocks, the function returns a boolean value based on whether `stdout` is empty or not. This approach is leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to properly check the contents of the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists in the database. It should not only check if `stdout` is empty or not.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return True if stdout else False
```

By modifying the return statements in the if and else blocks to include checks for the presence of the table in the `stdout`, we can ensure that the function returns the correct boolean value based on the existence of the table in the database.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
