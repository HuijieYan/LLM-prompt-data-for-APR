The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive. The `run_hive_cmd` function returns table names in lowercase, and the function compares the provided table name with the returned value without any case transformation, leading to incorrect results in case the table name is provided with different cases.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be updated to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the returned value to the same case, for example, lower case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version compares the lowercased table name with the lowercased stdout to make the comparison case-insensitive.

The corrected function should satisfy all the provided runtime and expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
