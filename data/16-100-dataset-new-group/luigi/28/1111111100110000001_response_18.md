The buggy function `table_exists` has two branches of logic. The first branch executes a `hive` command to check if a table exists, while the second branch executes a different `hive` command if there is a partition.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function incorrectly checks the presence of the table name in the stdout when there is no partition. It should be checking for an exact match, not just the presence of the table name.

Additionally, the buggy function incorrectly forms the command when there is a partition. It should use valid SQL syntax to check for the existence of the partition based on the partition specification.

The strategy to fix the bug is as follows:
- Modify the first branch to check for an exact match in the output without any additional data.
- Fix the SQL syntax in the second branch to correctly check for the existence of a partition within a table.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Other functions remain the same

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout == table
        else:
            partition_condition = ' AND '.join(['{0} = {1}'.format(col, val) for col, val in partition.items()])
            show_partition_cmd = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_condition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(show_partition_cmd)
            return stdout.strip() != ''
```

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
