The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity. This issue was raised in a GitHub issue where it was requested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking if a table exists. Currently, it only checks for an exact match between the provided table name and the table names obtained from the `stdout`, which causes problems due to case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `table_exists` function to convert both the provided table name and the table names obtained from the `stdout` to lowercase and then perform the check.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        # Use lower() to convert both the provided table name and the table names from the stdout to lowercase
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        # Check for exact match of the lowercase table name
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        # Use lower() to convert both the provided table name and the table names from the stdout to lowercase
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).lower()

        # Check for exact match of the lowercase table name
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
```

The code has been modified to convert both the provided table name and the table names obtained from the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method. Then the `in` operator is used to check for an exact match of the lowercase table name within the lowercase table names obtained from the `stdout`.

This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussions and makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence.
