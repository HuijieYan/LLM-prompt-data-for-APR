To fix the bug, the table name should be converted to lowercase before checking if it exists in the stdout. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. The issue on GitHub has also been addressed by making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, as requested.
