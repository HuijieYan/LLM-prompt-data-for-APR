The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being incorrectly called, and the logic to check for the existence of a table is flawed. Additionally, the way the `partition_spec` function is being used is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called with the appropriate parameters, and the logic for checking the existence of a table should be adjusted. Additionally, the `partition_spec` function should be correctly utilized to check for the existence of a partition.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() == table  # Check if the exact table name is in the output
        else:
            partition_spec_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                'use {}; show partitions {}.{} partition ({})'.format(database, table, table, partition_spec_str)
            )
            return bool(stdout)  # Check if any output is returned
```

In the corrected code, we fixed the command formatting for `run_hive_cmd` and adjusted the logic for checking the existence of the table and partition. We also used the `strip` method to remove any extra white spaces from the output and converted the result to a boolean value, returning `True` if there is output and `False` if there is none.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
