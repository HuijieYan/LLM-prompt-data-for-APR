The issue in the buggy function is that it does not account for the case sensitivity of table names when comparing them to the `stdout` value. This can cause the function to return incorrect results, leading to failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` values to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
