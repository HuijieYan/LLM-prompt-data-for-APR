The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way the `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` functions are being called and utilized. 

The issue might be with the condition for checking the existence of a table in the `table_exists` function. In the case where the `stdout` contains the table name, the function is returning `True`. However, this logic is incorrect and should be improved.

Based on the failing test cases and the runtime values and types of variables inside the `table_exists` function, we can see that the issue lies with the comparison of `table in stdout`. In some cases, the test table name is found within a larger string (for example, `OK\nmytable`), which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic should be adjusted. Instead of checking for a simple substring match, we should check that the exact table name is in the output string.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` string on the newline character and checking for an exact match with the table name, we ensure that the comparison is accurate. This should result in the `table_exists` function passing the failing tests.
