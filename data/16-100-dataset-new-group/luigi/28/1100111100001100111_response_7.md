Based on the input and output values and the related GitHub issues, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of the table in the Hive database. The function is not considering the case of the table name when comparing it with the output of the Hive commands.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output to be case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison to make the comparison case-insensitive. This effectively addresses the issue posted in the GitHub issue while also considering the potential case sensitivity from the provided test cases.
