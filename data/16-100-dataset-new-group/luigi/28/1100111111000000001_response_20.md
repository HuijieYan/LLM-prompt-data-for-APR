The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not correctly handle partitioned tables. The function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions to determine if a table exists, but it has a bug when dealing with tables that have partitions.

The bug occurs when checking for the existence of a partitioned table. The function incorrectly constructs the Hive command to check for the existence of a partition, leading to incorrect results being returned.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to properly handle partitioned tables.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions here...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            if isinstance(partition, dict):
                partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            else:
                partition_str = partition

            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version includes a conditional to properly handle the construction of the Hive command when checking for the existence of a partition in a table.

By implementing these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
