The bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive when checking for table existence, causing it to fail in cases where the table names have different cases. This issue was reported on GitHub as issue #896 and it was suggested to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

To fix the bug, we will modify the `table_exists` function to transform the table name to lowercase and then compare it with the lowercase `stdout`.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence, ensuring that the tests pass and addressing the GitHub issue.
