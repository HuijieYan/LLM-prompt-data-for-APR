Analysis:
The bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The current implementation does not account for case differences when comparing the table name to the table names returned from the Hive commands.

Error locations:
1. The comparison between the table name and the stdout is not case insensitive. This can lead to false negatives if the case of the table name does not match the case of the table names returned from Hive.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the failure to account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the table names returned from the Hive commands. This leads to incorrect results in the check for table existence.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the stdout case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to the same case before comparison.

Corrected version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```
