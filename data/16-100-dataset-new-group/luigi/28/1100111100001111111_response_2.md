The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the fact that the function does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes issues when users search for tables with mixed case names, as Hive is case insensitive but returns table names in lowercase. The GitHub issue provides a detailed explanation of the problem and suggests the fix, which is to check `table.lower()` against `stdout.lower()` to avoid case issues.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other class functions and methods here...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, thereby addressing the issue described in the GitHub post.
