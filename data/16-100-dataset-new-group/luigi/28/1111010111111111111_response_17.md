The bug in the `table_exists` method is that it is sensitive to the case of the table name while querying hive. It should be case insensitive. The failing test cases indicate that when checking for the existence of a table with a different case, the assertion fails.

To fix the bug, the returned `stdout` should be compared after converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the expected input/output values will be satisfied, the failing tests will pass, and the issue posted on GitHub will be resolved.
