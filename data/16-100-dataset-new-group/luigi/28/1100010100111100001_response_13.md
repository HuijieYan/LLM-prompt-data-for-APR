The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `stdout` value with the `table` name. The function needs to properly handle the newline character in the `stdout` value in order to correctly check if the table exists.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the newline character in the `stdout` variable when checking for the existence of the table.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to strip any leading or trailing whitespace, including newline characters, from the `stdout` variable before performing the comparison with the `table` name.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.strip()  # Stripping leading/trailing whitespace
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By stripping the trailing newline character or any extra whitespace from the `stdout` variable, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
