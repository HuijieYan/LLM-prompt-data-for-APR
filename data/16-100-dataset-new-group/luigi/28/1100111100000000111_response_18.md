### Analysis:
The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is part of the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The GitHub issue highlights that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of the table name to the content of `stdout` might not account for case differences.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not accounting for case differences when checking for table existence. This can result in false negatives when the table name case does not match the case in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` content should be made case insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` content has been made case insensitive using the `lower()` method. This will ensure that the function is now case insensitive when checking for table existence.
