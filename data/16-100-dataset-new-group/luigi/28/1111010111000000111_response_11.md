# The potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error in the `table_exists` function is that it only checks for the presence of the table name in the standard output from the Hive command. The comparison is case-sensitive, which causes issues when checking for table existence, especially with tables that are defined with capitalized names. 

# The cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the failing test, the GitHub Issue information:
The bug occurs due to the case sensitivity of the comparison made in the `table_exists` function. The failing test demonstrates that the function does not handle case-insensitive comparisons correctly. The GitHub issue confirms this by discussing how Hive returns table names as lower case, causing the case-sensitive check to fail.

# Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence. We can convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before making the comparison.

# The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                               (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lower case using the `lower()` function before making the comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
