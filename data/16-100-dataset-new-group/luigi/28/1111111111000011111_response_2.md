The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug related to case sensitivity in table name comparisons. The test case fails when checking for table existence with different case variations. The expected behavior is for the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive and return `True` when the table exists, regardless of case.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case-sensitive. The function expects an exact match between the provided table name and the one in the stdout, resulting in the test cases failing when there's a case mismatch.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command needs to be made case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the function `table_exists`:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version uses the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue #896. With this correction, the function will now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
