Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison between the table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive command output. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison will fail if the case of the table names does not match.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the names retrieved from the Hive command output to lowercase before performing the comparison.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version of the function, we convert both the table name and the names retrieved from the Hive command output to lowercase before performing the comparison. This resolves the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
