The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in the `stdout`. This is causing the test cases to fail, especially when the table name has different cases in the `stdout` compared to the input.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the `stdout` and the table name to lowercase before comparing them for existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `stdout` and `table` to lowercase before comparing them, the function will now be case insensitive when checking for table existence. This will resolve the failing test cases.
