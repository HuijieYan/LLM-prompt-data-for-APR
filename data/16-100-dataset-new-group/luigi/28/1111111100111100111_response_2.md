The bug in the code is that the table_exist function doesn't handle the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive query, which results in a case-sensitive comparison. This causes the function to fail when the table names have different cases.

To fix this bug, the table name should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout to make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, the function now becomes case insensitive, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
