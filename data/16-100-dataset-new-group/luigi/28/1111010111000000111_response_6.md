The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class within the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is causing issues in the test case. The issue reported on GitHub also indicates that the problem is related to case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function.

Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the table name with the `stdout` is case sensitive, leading to failures in the test case when the table name's case does not match the `stdout`.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function directly compares the given table name with the `stdout`, which returns the table names in lowercase. This causes issues when the table name's case does not match the case of the table name present in the `stdout`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case insensitive, allowing the function to handle tables with different cases efficiently. This can be achieved by comparing the lower case of both the table name and the `stdout`.

Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
In the corrected version, the comparison between the table name and `stdout` is done in lowercase, making the comparison case insensitive. This change will resolve the issue reported in the failing test cases and the GitHub issues.
