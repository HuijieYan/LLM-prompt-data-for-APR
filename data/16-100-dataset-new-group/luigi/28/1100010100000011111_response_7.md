Given the GitHub issue and the analysis of the expected input/output values, it appears that the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The bug causes the function to fail when checking for tables with capitalized names, as Hive returns them as lower case.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function will convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for existence, making it case insensitive and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
