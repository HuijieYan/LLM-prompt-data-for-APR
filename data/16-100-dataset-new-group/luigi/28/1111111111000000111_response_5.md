The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it's not case insensitive, causing the test to fail when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue on GitHub suggests that the `table_exists` function should be modified to be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the output of the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
