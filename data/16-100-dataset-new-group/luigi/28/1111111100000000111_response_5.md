## Analysis
The bug is related to the case sensitivity of the table name when checking for its existence in the Hive database. The function `table_exists` does not handle the case sensitivity, which leads to issues when the table name is defined as capitalized, rather than lower case underscored names. The GitHub issue indicates that the fix should involve checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This leads to false negatives when the table name is in a different case than expected.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. The comparison should be made with the lowercased version of both the table name and the output from the Hive command.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` ensures that the table name is checked against the output from the Hive command in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
