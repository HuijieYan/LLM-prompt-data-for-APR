The buggy function has a conditional statement that checks if the partition is None. If it is, it runs a command using the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in the specified database. If the partition is not None, it runs a different command to check if the partition exists.

One potential issue in the code is the use of the `and` operator in the first `if` statement. This can cause unexpected behavior and may not accurately determine if the table exists in the specified database.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statement to use the `in` operator, and include a list of tables returned from the command execution. This will ensure that the function accurately verifies the existence of the table in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
    
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With the revised function, the code should now accurately determine whether the table exists in the specified database, with or without a partition. The use of the `in` operator and `split()` function ensures that the returned string is properly parsed, and the `bool` function returns the correct Boolean value based on the presence of the partition.

This corrected version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the failing test cases.
