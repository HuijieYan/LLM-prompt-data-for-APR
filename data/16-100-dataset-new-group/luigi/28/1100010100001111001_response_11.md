The bug in the provided function is that the `table_exists` function does not correctly handle the case of receiving multiple table names in the `stdout` output. It simply checks if the table name is in the `stdout` string, which causes issues when there are multiple table names as sub-strings. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to split the `stdout` string by newlines and then check if the table name exists in any of the resulting strings.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function splits the `stdout` string by newlines and then checks if the table name matches any of the resulting lines, returning `True` or `False` accordingly.
