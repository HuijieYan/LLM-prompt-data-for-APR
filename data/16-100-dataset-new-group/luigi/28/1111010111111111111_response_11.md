The bug in the `table_exists` method is causing assertions to fail in the provided test cases. The issue arises from the method not being case insensitive and failing to account for case differences between the table parameter and the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, the method is returning `True` or `False` based on stdout and not including a check for the table in stdout.

To fix the bug, the method should be modified to compare the lowercase version of the table parameter with the lowercase version of the stdout. Additionally, the condition to check if the table exists in stdout should be included.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the method is now case insensitive and correctly checks for the existence of the table in the stdout.

This correction resolves the GitHub issue #896 and addresses the failing test cases.
