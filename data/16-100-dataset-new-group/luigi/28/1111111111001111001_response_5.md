The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be caused by the incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `self.partition_spec` function. In the second part of the function when `partition` is not None, it should call the `partition_spec` method to get the partition value. However, the code incorrectly uses `self.partition_spec(partition)` instead of `self.partition_spec(partition)`. Additionally, the condition to check the existence of a table in the database is not handling the case where the table name is not found.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `self.partition_spec(partition)` method correctly and also handle the case when the table is not found in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = '='.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str});")
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In the corrected version, we are using f-strings for better readability and maintaining the partition condition for the `stdout` value. Additionally, we are using the `bool()` function to directly convert the `stdout` value to a boolean, which handles the case when the table is not found in the database.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
