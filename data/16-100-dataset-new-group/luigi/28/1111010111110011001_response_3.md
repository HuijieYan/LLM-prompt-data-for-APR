The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not returning the expected values, causing the associated test cases to fail.

The potential error is in the conditionals used to determine the return value. It seems that the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is not working as expected, and the conditional `if stdout:` may also not be evaluating the expected values correctly.

The buggy function in `HiveCommandClient` has a bug where it does not correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and does not return the expected values for different test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions used to determine the return value based on the `stdout` variable. Additionally, the format of the `stdout` variable may need to be parsed or handled differently.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() == 'OK'

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}
                partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the conditions have been simplified and the `stdout` variable is stripped of leading/trailing whitespaces when compared to the expected output. The boolean value of `stdout` is returned directly in the `else` branch.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
