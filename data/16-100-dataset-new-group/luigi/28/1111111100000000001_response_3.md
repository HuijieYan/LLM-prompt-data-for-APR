The buggy function `table_exists` has potential error locations in the if and else blocks, where it calls the `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` functions. The issue is likely related to the implementation of these functions in the `HiveCommandClient` class and the `run_hive_cmd` function in the same file.

The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling the command execution properly. It is not checking the return code when `run_hive_cmd` is called, and it is also not passing the correct arguments when running the command with the `self.partition_spec` function.

To fix the bug, you should add error handling to the `run_hive_cmd` function to check the return code, and also ensure that the correct arguments are passed when calling `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` within the `table_exists` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Implementation of the partition_spec function

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table), check_return_code=True)
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str), check_return_code=True)
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a `check_return_code` argument when calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to ensure that the return code is checked. We have also fixed the formatting of the command string when calling `run_hive_cmd` with `self.partition_spec` function to provide the correct arguments. Additionally, we have used `bool(stdout)` directly instead of an if-else statement to improve readability.
