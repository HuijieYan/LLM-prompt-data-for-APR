The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` has a few issues:
1. The first condition `if partition is None` doesn't directly match the expected test cases. The function should only return True if the table is found in the stdout.
2. In the `else` block, the `run_hive_cmd` command is formed improperly, and it doesn't check if the table exists in that specific partition.

Based on the failing test cases and the expected input/output values, a corrected strategy for fixing the bug would be to:
1. Modify the 'if' condition block to only return True if the table is found in the stdout in the case where `partition is None`.
2. Correct the 'else' block to run the `run_hive_cmd` command properly, fetching the specific partition and then check if the table exists in that partition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function should pass all the provided test cases.
