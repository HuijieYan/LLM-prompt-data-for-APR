The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs when `run_hive_cmd` is called. The inputs to the function are not properly constructed, which causes the function to fail. The issue is likely due to incorrect formatting of the command sent to `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly format the command sent to `run_hive_cmd` based on the `partition` parameter. The corrected version will handle the partition and non-partition cases separately.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_clause = ' and '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_clause))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
In this corrected version, we construct the command to be sent to `run_hive_cmd` based on the `partition` parameter. We also include proper formatting for the partition clause, separating each key-value pair with 'and'.

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
