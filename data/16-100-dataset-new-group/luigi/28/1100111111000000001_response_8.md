The buggy function table_exists in the HiveCommandClient class is failing the test test_table_exists due to incorrect validation logic.

The issue is with the logic used to check if the table exists when the partition is not None. The buggy function is not handling the case properly for when the stdout is not empty. The if condition always returns True, even when stdout is empty, resulting in incorrect validation.

To fix this, we need to update the logic inside the else block to properly handle the case when stdout is not empty.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return stdout != ""
```

The corrected version includes a modified else block to return True if stdout is not empty and False if stdout is empty.

This corrected version should pass the failing test test_table_exists.
