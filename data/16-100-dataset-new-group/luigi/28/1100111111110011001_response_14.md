The cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that the return value is not being checked correctly in the `if` conditions. Additionally, the mocking of the `run_hive_cmd` function is not properly handled in the test cases, and the `partition_spec` function is being called with incorrect arguments.

To fix the bug, the `if` conditions for checking the `stdout` variable should be adjusted to account for the expected return values. Additionally, the mocking of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `partition_spec` function should be correctly handled in the test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return 'OK' in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return 'OK' in stdout
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
