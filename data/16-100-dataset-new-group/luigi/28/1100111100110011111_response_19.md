The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the test to fail because it doesn't account for case sensitivity. The expected behavior is for the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

The buggy function `table_exists` doesn't handle case sensitivity properly. It only checks if the table name exists in the output of the Hive command, but it doesn't consider the case of the table name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison. This will ensure case insensitivity is respected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, we ensure that case insensitivity is respected. This corrected version should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
