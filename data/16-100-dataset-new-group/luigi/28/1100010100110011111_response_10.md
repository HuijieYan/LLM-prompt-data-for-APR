To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the tables in the stdout case insensitive. This will address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function correctly identifies the table's existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the function will compare the lowercase version of the table name with the tables in the stdout, making the comparison case insensitive. This correction addresses the reported GitHub issue and ensures that the function passes the failing tests.
