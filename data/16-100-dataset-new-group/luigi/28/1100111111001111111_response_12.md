The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence. This causes the test cases to fail when checking for tables with different cases.

To fix this bug, the function needs to convert both table names and the stdout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, and the function will return the expected results.

This change also addresses the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making `table_exists` case insensitive.
