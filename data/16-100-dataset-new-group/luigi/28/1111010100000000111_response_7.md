1. The buggy function is the `table_exists` method within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` file. The GitHub issue is related to making the `table_exists` method case insensitive.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the comparisons of `table` and `stdout` without considering the case sensitivity.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` method does not handle case sensitivity properly when comparing the table name with the stdout from the Hive command. This results in incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table with a different case.

4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the `table_exists` method to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command.

5. The corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between the table name and stdout has been modified to be case insensitive by converting both to lowercase. This ensures that table names with different cases will be correctly detected as existing tables.
