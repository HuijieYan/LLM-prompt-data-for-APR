The buggy function 'table_exists' in the class 'HiveCommandClient' from the file 'luigi/contrib/hive.py' needs to be fixed. The function is failing the test due to a case sensitivity issue. The test is expecting a case-insensitive comparison while the function makes a case-sensitive comparison.

The root cause of the bug is that the 'table_exists' function does not perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table name in the stdout. The test functions are expecting a case-insensitive comparison and thus failing for the test case where the table name is different in case from the expected name.

To fix the bug, the 'table_exists' function should perform case-insensitive comparison of the table name in the stdout. The comparison between the table name and the output from the hive command should use case-insensitive comparison methods.

Here's the corrected and updated version of the 'table_exists' function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version of the function, the comparison of table names in the stdout is made case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison. This change will ensure that the test cases expecting case-insensitive behavior will pass, and the issue mentioned in GitHub will be resolved.

This fix will resolve GitHub issue #896 and make the table_exists function case-insensitive, as expected.
