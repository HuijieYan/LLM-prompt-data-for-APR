The buggy function `table_exists`  looks at whether a table or a partition exists in a given database and partitioned term, based on the scripts passed. The main problem stems from the condition checking code in the function.

The main problem lies in the `if` statement followed by `else` and the nested `if-else` conditional statement. The nested `if-else` statement always returns True, regardless of the outcome.

To fix the bug, you could change the last `if else` statement into a single `return` statement to return the result of the stdout check.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version will fix the bug related to the failing test.
