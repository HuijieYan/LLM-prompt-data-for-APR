The issue with the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class from the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is that it is not case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. This causes test failures when the case of the table name doesn't match the case of the returned `stdout` from the Hive query. The reported GitHub issues #896 and a related discussion provide a clear indication of the problem and a proposed solution.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method needs to modify the way it compares the table name in the `stdout`. It should convert both `table` and `stdout` to a consistent case, for example by converting both to lowercase, then check for the presence of `table` in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(
                database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` strings are compared in lowercase, which ensures case-insensitivity, and the correct result is returned for the presence of the table in the `stdout`.

This fix resolves the reported GitHub issue #896 and addresses the case sensitivity problem, ensuring that the `table_exists` method works correctly for table names with different casing.
