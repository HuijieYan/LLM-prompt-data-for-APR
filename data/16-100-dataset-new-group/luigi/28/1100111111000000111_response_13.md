The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive, which causes the test cases to fail when the table name case does not match exactly. This bug is related to GitHub issues #896 and #1374, where the users are reporting the case insensitivity problem with the `table_exists` function. The cause of the bug is due to the direct comparison of `table` and `stdout`, which does not account for case differences.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issues reported in GitHub. This corrected version makes the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them.
