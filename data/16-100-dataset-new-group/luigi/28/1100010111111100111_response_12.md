To fix the bug, it is clear that the current implementation of the `table_exist` function does not handle case insensitivity correctly. It should compare the table name with the tables retrieved from the Hive command in a case insensitive manner. The correction involves converting the strings to lowercase for comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive match.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exist` function with the necessary changes:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now handle case insensitivity correctly and pass the failing tests. This change aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue, addressing the case sensitivity problem when checking for table existence in Hive.
