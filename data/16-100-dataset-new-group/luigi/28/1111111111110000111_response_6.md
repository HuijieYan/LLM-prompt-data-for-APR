The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the tests and causing an assertion error. The issue has been identified as case-sensitivity when checking for existing tables in Hive. The bug is causing the test cases to fail, as Hive is returning table names in lowercase, leading to false negatives.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to make it case-insensitive. The comparison between the table name and the output from Hive should be performed in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue identified in the GitHub reports.

By making this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue related to the case-insensitivity problem.
