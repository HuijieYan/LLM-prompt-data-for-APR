After analyzing the provided buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, the potential error locations in the function are identified. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the return value of the run_hive_cmd properly, resulting in incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists or not.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function captures the output of run_hive_cmd and then check if the table exists based on the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return 'OK' in stdout.split()  # Check if 'OK' is in the list of tables

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return 'OK' in stdout.split()  # Check if 'OK' is in the list of partitions
```

The corrected version of the function captures the output of run_hive_cmd and then checks if the 'OK' string is present in the output to determine whether the table or partition exists.

With this fixed version, the provided failing test function should now pass without any issues.
