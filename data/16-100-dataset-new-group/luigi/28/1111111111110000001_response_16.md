The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to run a Hive command and checks if a table exists. However, the logic in the function is flawed, leading to the failure of the corresponding test cases.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable when checking if a table exists. If the `stdout` is not empty, the function erroneously returns `True` for tables that don't exist.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the existence of a table needs to be corrected, and the condition for returning `True` or `False` needs to be adjusted based on the actual result from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... Other functions ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_clause = ' and '.join(f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items())
            show_partitions_cmd = f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_clause})"
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(show_partitions_cmd)
            return table in stdout
```

This corrected version addresses the issues by properly handling the `stdout` variable based on the Hive command execution and returning the correct result based on the existent of the table in the partition. The corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
