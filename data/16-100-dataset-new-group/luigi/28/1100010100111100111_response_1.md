The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. This results in failing tests when the table name is in a different case than expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, which may not match due to case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the fixed function, the comparison is done after converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to making `table_exists` case insensitive.
