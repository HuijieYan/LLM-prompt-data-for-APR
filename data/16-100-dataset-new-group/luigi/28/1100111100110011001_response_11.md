The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database, and it uses the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `partition_spec` method to accomplish this. The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

The bug in the function is causing it to return incorrect values, which is leading to failed test cases. The error messages indicate that the expected outcome is not being achieved for the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function and use it to determine if the table exists or not.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_spec))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we make sure the `partition_spec` is correctly retrieved and used when partition is not `None`. Then, we determine if the table exists based on whether the `run_hive_cmd` returns any value.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
