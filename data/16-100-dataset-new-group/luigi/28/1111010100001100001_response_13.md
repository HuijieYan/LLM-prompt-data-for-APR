The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has two main issues:
1. In the case where `partition` is None, the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called correctly. It should be using a single `%` instead of double `%%` as used when string formatting with the `.format` method.
2. In the case where `partition` is not None, the logic to check if `stdout` has any value is incorrect. It should be checking if the table is present in `stdout` instead.

To fix these issues, the following changes should be made to the `table_exists` function:
1. For the case where `partition` is None, update the string formatting method to use a single `%` instead of double `%%`.
2. For the case where `partition` is not None, check if the table name is present in `stdout` before returning the result.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout
```
