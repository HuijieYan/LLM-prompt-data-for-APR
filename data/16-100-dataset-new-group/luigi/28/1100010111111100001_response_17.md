The issue in the provided code is that the `table_exists` function is not returning the correct output based on the conditions. Let's analyze the buggy function and the failing test cases to identify the potential error locations and the cause of the bug:

1. The `table_exists` function has two conditions:
   a. If `partition` is None, it runs a hive command and checks if the table exists in the output.
   b. If `partition` is not None, it runs a different hive command and checks if the partition exists in the output.

2. The potential error locations are:
   a. The condition for checking if the table exists based on the output of the hive command.
   b. The condition for checking if the partition exists based on the output of the hive command.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the output of the hive commands in both conditions. As a result, the return value of the function is incorrect, leading to failing test cases. 

4. To fix the bug, we need to accurately check the stdout of the hive commands and return true if the table or partition exists in the output, and false otherwise.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function based on the analysis:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we accurately check the `stdout` of the hive commands and return `True` if the table or partition exists in the output, and `False` otherwise. This should address the issues causing the failing test cases.
