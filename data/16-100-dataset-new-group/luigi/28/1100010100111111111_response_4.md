To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This change will address the failing test cases and also resolve the GitHub issues related to the case insensitivity of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing test cases. Additionally, it addresses the GitHub issues related to the case insensitivity of the function.
