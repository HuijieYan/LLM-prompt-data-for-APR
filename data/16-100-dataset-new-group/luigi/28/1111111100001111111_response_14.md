Based on the GitHub issue and the provided functions, it appears that the bug is related to case sensitivity in the Hive table existence check. The issue mentions that in some cases, tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns their names in lowercase. The code does not handle this case insensitivity, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be updated to check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function now checks for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner. This addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the function behaves as expected for all input cases.
