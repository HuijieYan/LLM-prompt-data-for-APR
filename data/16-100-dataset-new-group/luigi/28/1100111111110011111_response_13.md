### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases, particularly in situations where the table names are being compared without case sensitivity. The problem is related to the case being used in the comparison (`table in stdout`). There is an open GitHub issue (#896) discussing this problem, as the function should be case insensitive. The current implementation only checks for an exact match, leading to the test failures.

### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `table_exists` function is occurring due to the comparison of the table names without considering case sensitivity. 

### Error Cause
The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `table_exists` is not considering case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the `stdout` to the given table name.

### Suggested Fix
The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison to make it case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` and `stdout` variables to lower case before comparing.

### Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is as follows:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With the corrected version, the function now converts both the `table` and `stdout` variables to lower case before comparing, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive. This will fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
