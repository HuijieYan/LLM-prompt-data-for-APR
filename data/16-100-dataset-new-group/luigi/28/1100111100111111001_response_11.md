The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to an issue with the conditionals. In the first if-else block, the buggy function checks if `stdout` is empty or not and returns the result accordingly. However, the check should be in reverse; the function should return `False` if the `stdout` is empty and `True` otherwise. Additionally, the second if-else block doesn't handle the case where `stdout` contains the table name, leading to incorrect logic.

To fix the bug, we need to reverse the conditionals and handle the case where `stdout` contains the table name correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other methods)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout.strip() != ""  # Check if stdout is not empty and return True
    
        else:
            partition_filter = ' AND '.join([f'{k} = "{v}"' for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_filter})')
    
            return table in stdout  # Check if the table name is in the stdout and return True
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values for all the provided cases.
