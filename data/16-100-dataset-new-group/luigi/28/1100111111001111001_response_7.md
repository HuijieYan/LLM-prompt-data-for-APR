The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the `run_hive_cmd` function and the conditional checks based on the `stdout` variable.

The issue is that the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is only checking if `stdout` has a value and if `table` is present in `stdout`. This condition does not verify if `table` is a separate word in `stdout`.

Additionally, the use of the `partition_spec` function seems incorrect, as it should be invoked as a method of the class rather than directly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks to ensure that `table` is a separate word in `stdout`. We also need to correct the invocation of the `partition_spec` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and f'\n{table}\n' in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version includes the adjustments mentioned above. The updated conditional check ensures that `table` is a separate word within the `stdout` value, and the `partition_spec` function is invoked correctly.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
