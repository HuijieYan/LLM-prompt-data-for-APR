By analyzing the failing tests, the runtime input/output values, and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity. The function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the `table` name with the tables in the Hive database.

To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the lowercase version of the `table` name with the tables in the Hive database, effectively making the comparison case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version uses the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` name and the retrieved tables from the Hive database to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring case insensitivity.

This fix addresses the failing tests related to case insensitivity and resolves the issues posted on GitHub.
