The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing incorrect outputs and needs to be fixed. The issue lies in the way the `stdout` variable is being used to check the existence of a table or partitions.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are when checking the existence of a table or partitions using the `stdout` variable after invoking `run_hive_cmd`. The logic to check for the existence of the table or partitions needs to be revised.

The cause of the bug is that the function is returning the condition `stdout and table in stdout`. This means that if `stdout` is empty, the function will return `False`, which may not be correct.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the logic that checks the existence of a table or partitions. Instead of using the condition `stdout and table in stdout`, we can directly check if the `stdout` contains the information we are looking for.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions here...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout  # Check if the table exists in the stdout
        else:
            partition_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_output})")
            return bool(stdout)  # Check if the stdout is not empty
```

In the corrected version, we directly check if the `table` is in the `stdout` when no partition is provided, and we check if the `stdout` is not empty when a partition is provided. This should address the bug and ensure the correct behavior of the `table_exists` function.
