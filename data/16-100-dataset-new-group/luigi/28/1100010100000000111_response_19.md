## Analysis
The buggy function table_exists in luigi/contrib/hive.py is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This causes issues when the table names are defined with different capitalization, as Hive is case insensitive.

## Error locations
The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison of the table name with the stdout without considering case sensitivity.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the function not converting the table name to lowercase when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This leads to issues when table names are defined in different capitalization, as Hive is case insensitive.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout, making the comparison case insensitive.

## The corrected version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
