The cause of the buggy behavior in the `table_exists` function is that the conditional check for the existence of the table is incorrectly implemented, resulting in incorrect return values. The function `run_hive_cmd` is used to run Hive commands, and the return value of this function is used to determine the existence of the table. However, in some cases, the output is not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect evaluations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks and how the return values from `run_hive_cmd` are handled.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions in the class

    def run_hive_cmd(self, hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
        # implementation of run_hive_cmd

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Simply check if stdout has any content
```

By explicitly checking if `stdout` has any content using `bool(stdout)` instead of comparing with hardcoded values, we ensure that the correct evaluation takes place, improving the accuracy of the function.

Additionally, it's important to make sure that `self.run_hive_cmd` is the correct function being called, which may be different based on the class context. It's also important to handle the `stdout` response accurately within the `run_hive_cmd` function.

By making these changes, the corrected function should properly determine the existence of the table based on the output of Hive commands.
