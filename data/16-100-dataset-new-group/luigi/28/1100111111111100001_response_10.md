The cause of the bug is that when the partition is not None, the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with a string that contains formatting placeholders, but the string itself isn't formatted using those placeholders.

To fix the bug, the string in the call to `run_hive_cmd` needs to be properly formatted. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            # Properly format the string before passing it to run_hive_cmd
            partition_str = ', '.join([f"{key}='{value}'" for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the failing tests should pass.
