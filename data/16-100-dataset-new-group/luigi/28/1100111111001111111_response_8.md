To fix the bug, it seems that the `table_exists` function needs to be updated to check for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the stdout. This would address the failing test cases and the GitHub issue related to the case insensitivity problem. 

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function should include the following modifications:
1. Convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the stdout.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function based on the identified bug and the expected input/output values:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and properly handle case sensitivity issues for table names in the Hive database. This should also address the reported GitHub issue related to case insensitivity.
