The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the way the `stdout` variable is being compared to the table name.

The function first checks if `partition` is None, and if so, it runs a hive command to show tables in the specified database and then checks if the table exists in the output.

The bug occurs because the function checks if `table in stdout`, but the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the entire string of the output, including the "OK" message. This causes the comparison to fail, as "OKmytable" is not equal to "mytable".

To fix this bug, we should modify the comparison to check if the table name is preceded by a newline character.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and f"\n{table}\n" in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if the table name is present in the output, preceded and followed by a newline character, ensuring that it is an exact match. This should address the failing test cases.
