The buggy function `table_exists` has two potential error locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` does not account for case sensitivity, which causes the failing test in the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` functions.
2. The second part of the function could have an issue in constructing the SQL command due to improper formatting.

The cause of the bug is the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This causes the failing test in the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` functions, as well as the GitHub issue #896, which discusses the problem of case insensitivity in `table_exists`.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. This corrected version should address the issue raised in GitHub and pass the failing tests in the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` functions.
