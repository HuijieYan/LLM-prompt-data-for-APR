The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The purpose of this function is to check if a given table exists in a database, optionally for a specific partition.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. In the first part of the function, `stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))`, where the `run_hive_cmd` function is called. There is no check for the return code of `run_hive_cmd`.
2. In the second part of the function, there is a string formatting issue in the `stdout = run_hive_cmd` line, where the `partition_spec` function is being called.

The cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called, but the return code is not being checked. Also, there are issues with the string formatting and calling the `partition_spec` function.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to:
1. Add a check for the return code of the `run_hive_cmd` function to ensure that it was successful.
2. Correct the string formatting issue and the calling of the `partition_spec` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table), check_return_code=True)
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_string = ', '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_string), check_return_code=True)
            return bool(stdout)
```
