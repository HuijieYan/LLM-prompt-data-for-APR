The identified potential error locations within the buggy function are:
- The bug may be in the `table_exists` function, where the table name is compared against the output from running a Hive command.
- The comparison may be case-sensitive, causing the test to fail when the table name's case in the Hive output does not match the input table name's case.

The cause of the bug is the case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. This causes the test to fail when the case of the table name does not match the case of the table name in the Hive output.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command should be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This makes the comparison case-insensitive and ensures that the function behaves as expected.
