From the provided buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the logic of the `table_exists` function. The function is not handling the case when the partition is not None properly, leading to incorrect return values for some test cases.

The potential error location is in the `else` part of the `table_exists` function where it checks for the existence of partitions.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case when the partition is not None, leading to incorrect return values in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case when the partition is not None and properly checks for the existence of partitions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                       ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In the corrected version, the `else` part of the function has been modified to properly check for the existence of partitions and return the correct boolean value based on the `stdout` result. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
