The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is related to the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called and the way the partition is being handled.

The issue is with the `run_hive_cmd` function call. It is not being called with the correct arguments when `partition` is not None, as it should be using the `partition_spec` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class to construct the command.

Also, when checking for the existence of a partition, the `run_hive_cmd` call is not constructed correctly.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called with the correct arguments, depending on whether `partition` is `None`. If `partition` is `None`, then the `run_hive_cmd` should be called without the partition specification. If `partition` is not `None`, then the `partition_spec` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class should be used to construct the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions remain the same)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_command = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_command))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `run_hive_cmd` function will be called with the correct arguments based on the presence of the `partition`, and the partition specification will be handled appropriately.
