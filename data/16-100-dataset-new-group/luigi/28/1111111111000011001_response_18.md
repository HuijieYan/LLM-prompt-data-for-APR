The bug in the function `table_exists` seems to be with the conditional statements and how the `stdout` variable is being evaluated. The function is not returning the correct boolean value based on the `stdout` variable.

To fix this bug, we can update the condition to check for the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable; if found, we return `True`, otherwise `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
