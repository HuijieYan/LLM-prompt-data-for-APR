Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue, it is clear that the `table_exists` function is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. It should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to fix the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition).lower()))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- The table name and the lines in `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, making the checks case insensitive.
- The `return` statement for the check on `stdout` is simplified by using `bool(stdout)` to directly return `True` if `stdout` is not empty and `False` otherwise.

With these changes, the corrected `table_exists` function should pass all the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
