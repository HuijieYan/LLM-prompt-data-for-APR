To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercased `stdout` to account for case insensitivity in Hive. We will modify the function to convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before making the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version takes into account the case insensitivity of Hive by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, as required.
