The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The bug is due to the incorrect use of the `run_hive_cmd` function when the `partition` parameter is not None.

The bug is causing the failing test cases because the buggy function is not returning the expected results based on the input parameters. This is likely because the `run_hive_cmd` call is not being executed correctly, leading to incorrect `stdout` values.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function should be called with the appropriate command string and the return value from the `run_hive_cmd` call should be used to determine if the table exists or not.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is provided below:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ",".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            cmd = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
