The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the comparison of the `table` in the `stdout`. In some cases, the table name appears as part of a larger string in the `stdout`, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison to check if the table name appears as a whole word in the `stdout`. We can also use the `self.partition_spec` method to properly format the partition information.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and f'\\b{table}\\b' in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, the comparison `f'\\b{table}\\b' in stdout` ensures that we are checking if the table name appears as a whole word in the `stdout`. This should fix the bug related to incorrect table existence checks.
