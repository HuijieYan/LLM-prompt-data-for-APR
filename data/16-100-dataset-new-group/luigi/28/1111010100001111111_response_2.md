The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists. This causes issues when the table name is supplied with different capitalization than exists in the database. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to ensure that it performs a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function will now perform a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table, ensuring that it works correctly even when the capitalization of the table name differs from the one in the database. This resolves the issue reported in GitHub.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
