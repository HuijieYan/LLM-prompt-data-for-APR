To fix the buggy function, we need to modify the `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The issue seems to be with the conditional check and the `run_hive_cmd` calls. The method should return True if the table exists, and False if it does not. 

The buggy function tries to run Hive commands and checks for specific outputs, but the conditions and outputs are not handled correctly. 

Based on the failing test cases provided, we can identify the following issues:
1. The conditional checks within the `table_exists` method are not considering the expected output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The method does not handle the different output formats of `run_hive_cmd` properly.
3. The method does not handle the partition parameter correctly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` method to correctly handle the different output formats of `run_hive_cmd` and handle the partition parameter if provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return len(stdout) > 0
```

In this corrected version:
- For the case when no partition is provided, the method runs the hive command to show tables and checks if the table name exists in the output. It splits the stdout by newlines and checks if the table is in the list.
- For the case when a partition is provided, the method runs the hive command to show partitions and checks if the output is non-empty, indicating that the partition exists.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. The method now correctly handles the different output formats of `run_hive_cmd` and handles the partition parameter if provided.
