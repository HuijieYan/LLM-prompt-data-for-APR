The cause of the bug is related to the case sensitivity of the table existence check. The code currently directly compares the table name to the tables listed in the stdout, leading to failures when the case of the table name does not match the case in the database.

To fix this bug, the code should convert both the table name and the tables listed in the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the check case-insensitive and prevent issues caused by case mismatches.

Here's a corrected version of the table_exists function with the mentioned fix:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change, the case sensitivity of table existence checks will be removed, and the bug described in the GitHub issues will be fixed.
