The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class seems to have an issue related to the logic used for checking the existence of a table and handling partitions.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. In the `if partition is None` block, the logic to check the existence of a table in the `stdout` seems incorrect.
2. In the `else` block, the logic to handle partitions and check their existence in the `stdout` also seems incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not correctly use the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine whether a table exists in the database.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional checks for the existence of tables and partitions based on the values returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0}.{1};'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            partition_query = f"{self.partition_spec(partition)}"
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_query})")
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, for the table existence check without partitions, the `show tables` command is used to find the table in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. If found, it returns `True`.

For the partitioned table existence check, the `show partitions` command is used to find the table with the specified partition query in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. If found, it returns `True`.
