### Corrections:

#### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for table existence in the `stdout` output. This causes the test cases to fail when checking for table existence with different combinations of lowercase and uppercase letters.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison.

#### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the `stdout` output, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the issues reported in GitHub and passing the failing test cases.
