To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly checks whether the table exists in the database and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the result.

The bug is in the conditional checks for the existence of the table and the partition. The function is returning the opposite value of what is actually expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # directly return the boolean value of stdout
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
