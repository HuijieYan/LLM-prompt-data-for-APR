The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue in the GitHub repository confirms this and suggests a fix by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function will convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lower case before checking for table existence, making it case insensitive and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
