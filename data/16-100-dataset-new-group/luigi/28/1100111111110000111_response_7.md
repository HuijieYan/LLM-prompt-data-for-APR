The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive. When checking for an existing table, the function compares the table name returned by Hive with the table name given, and this can cause issues with case sensitivity. The buggy function does not account for the case difference, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both table names to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With the above correction, the `table_exists` function should now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue and passing the failing test cases. This fix also aligns with the GitHub issue and pull request related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
