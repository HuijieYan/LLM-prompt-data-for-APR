The bug in the function is caused by the condition for checking the existence of a table. It is not handling the different scenarios correctly.

To fix the bug, we can update the function to accurately determine if a table exists in the given database and handle the different scenarios for when a partition is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

This corrected version ensures that the function accurately checks for the existence of the table in the given database and handles the different scenarios for when a partition is specified.
