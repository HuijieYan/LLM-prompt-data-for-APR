The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class, where the comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command is case sensitive. This is causing the tests to fail, as pointed out in the GitHub issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, `table.lower()` is used to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with `stdout.lower()`, which also converts the stdout to lowercase. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
