## Corrected version of the function

# The corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))  # added "in {0}"

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))  # Changed %s to {0}, {1}, {2}
    
    return stdout  # simplified the return statement
```

## Analysis and Explanation
The buggy function has a few errors. 
1. In the first if statement, the "show tables" command should include "in {database}" and not just "use {database}". 
2. In the else statement, the "show partitions" command needs to use the format method instead of the percentage format.

The bug causes the function to return incorrect results for table existence checks.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
- Modify the "show tables" and "show partitions" commands to include the correct database and table information.
- Fix the formatting issues in the else statement.

I have provided the corrected version of the function with the necessary fixes.
