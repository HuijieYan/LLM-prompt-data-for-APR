Based on the provided cases, it seems that the bug may be related to the `run_hive_cmd` function not returning the expected output. Additionally, when the buggy function is called with a partition parameter, it calls the `self.partition_spec` function but does not seem to use its return value properly.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is returning the expected output. Additionally, we should use the return value of `self.partition_spec` properly when the partition parameter is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            part_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, part_spec))
    
            if stdout and part_spec in stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
