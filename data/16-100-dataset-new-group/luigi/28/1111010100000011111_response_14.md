The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The issue has been reported on GitHub, and a solution is suggested to fix this by checking stdout against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command, making the comparison case insensitive and resolving the bug.
