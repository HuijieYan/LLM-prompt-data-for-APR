The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that it does not handle the case insensitivity of the table names in Hive. The function compares the `stdout` string directly with the table name without considering the case, which can lead to false negatives for tables that are defined with different cases. The GitHub issue indicates that this bug was identified and a fix is suggested to make the comparison case insensitive.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the `stdout` string to lowercase before comparison.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we modify the comparison to use the lowercase versions of both the `table` and `stdout` strings. This makes the comparison case insensitive, as required to address the bug. Additionally, the function now directly returns the boolean value `True` or `False` based on the `stdout` string, eliminating the need for additional if-else conditions.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in GitHub by making the comparison case insensitive.
