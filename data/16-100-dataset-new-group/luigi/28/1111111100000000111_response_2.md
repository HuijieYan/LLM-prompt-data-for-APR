Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of table name with the stdout may not be case insensitive, causing the test to fail if the table name is in different cases in the stdout.
2. The condition in the return statements may not be handling the case insensitivity issue.

Cause of the Bug:
The table_exists function is not case insensitive when comparing the table name with the stdout from the hive query. This causes the test to fail if the table name is in a different case in the stdout. The GitHub issue confirms that the stdout returns table names in lowercase, but the function does not handle this case insensitivity, leading to the bug.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the comparison to be case insensitive when checking if the table name is in the stdout.
2. Update the return statements to handle the case insensitivity issue.

Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected version, the comparison of the table name with the stdout is made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase. The return statements are also simplified to handle the case insensitivity issue.
