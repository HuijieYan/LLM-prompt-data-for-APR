To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function:

1. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity, as described in the GitHub issues. The function is checking for an exact match between the table name provided and the table name returned from Hive. This check should be case insensitive according to the GitHub issues.
2. The bug is likely in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` performs a case-sensitive string comparison, which leads to failing tests when the case of the table name doesn't match the case of the table name returned from Hive.

To fix the bug:

In the `table_exists` function, change the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lower case before comparison.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing tests and handle the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issues.
