The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not properly handling the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It is expecting certain string formats in the stdout but not handling them properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for checking the existence of the table and handling the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}".format(database, table))
    
            if partition in stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, for the case where a partition is specified, the function properly checks if the partition exists in the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. If it does, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
