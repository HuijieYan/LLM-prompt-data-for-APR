To fix the bug, it's essential to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive. The issue arises because the function expects a case-sensitive match between the table name and the result of the Hive command, causing tests to fail when there's a case mismatch.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the issue:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making use of `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command. This will resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post and allow `table_exists` to function correctly in the test cases provided.
