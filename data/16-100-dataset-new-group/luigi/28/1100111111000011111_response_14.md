# The issue with the buggy function:
The issue with the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function needs to be modified to make it case insensitive.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase and then perform the check for the table existence. This will ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

# The corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the changes as specified above, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. This will also address the issue reported on GitHub related to making the function case insensitive.
