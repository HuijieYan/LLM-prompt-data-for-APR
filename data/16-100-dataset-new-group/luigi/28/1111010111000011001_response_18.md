The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional statements that check the value of the `stdout` variable. It seems that the method `run_hive_cmd` is supposed to retrieve the existence of a table or partition in a hive environment, but the current implementation does not return the correct values when checking for table existence.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not properly parse the `stdout` variable returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The expected value of the `stdout` variable is not being checked correctly, resulting in incorrect return values from the `table_exists` function.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditional statements after the `run_hive_cmd` calls to properly check if the expected table or partition exists based on the value of the `stdout` variable.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(
            database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
