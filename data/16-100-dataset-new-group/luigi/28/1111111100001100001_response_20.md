The bug in the `table_exists` function is that when `partition` is not None, the function should be checking if the given partition exists for the table in the specified database, but it is not doing that. Instead, it is trying to fetch the partition information from Hive and returning True if the stdout is not empty, and False otherwise. This behavior is incorrect and is causing the function to fail.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to query the Hive Metastore to check if the specified partition exists for the table in the given database.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition))

        return stdout and partition in stdout
```

With this fix, the function will correctly check if the given partition exists in the specified table and database, and return True if it does, and False otherwise.
