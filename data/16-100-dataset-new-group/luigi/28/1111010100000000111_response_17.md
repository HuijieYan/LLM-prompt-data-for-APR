## Analysis
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does not check for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the entries in the `stdout` returned from hive commands. This causes issues when checking for existing tables with different cases.

## Error Location
The error lies in the comparison of the table name with the entries in the `stdout` without considering case insensitivity.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the fact that Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase. However, the `table_exists` function does not take this into account, leading to failed table existence checks.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
