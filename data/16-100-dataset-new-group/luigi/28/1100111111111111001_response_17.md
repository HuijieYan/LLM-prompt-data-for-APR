The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle the case-insensitive nature of table names correctly. When checking if the table exists, it should compare the table names regardless of case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to handle case-insensitive table name comparisons.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected function, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the names from `stdout` to lowercase before making the comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the bug identified in the failing tests.

This corrected version should pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
