The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the handling of the `stdout` variable and the conditions for returning `True` or `False` based on its value.

The first issue is with the logic in the if-else statement:
```python
if stdout:
    return True
else:
    return False
```
This logic can be simplified to just `return bool(stdout)`.

The second issue is with the construction of the `stdout` variable in the `else` case:
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
```
The formatting here is incorrect and potentially not executing the command correctly.

To resolve these issues, the logic for creating `stdout` and the condition to return `True` or `False` should be simplified, and the command should be constructed and executed properly.

The corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return bool(stdout)
    else:
        part_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({part_spec})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for constructing `stdout` and the condition for returning `True` or `False`. It also properly constructs and executes the command in the else case. With this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
