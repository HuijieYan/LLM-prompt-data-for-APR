The potential error in the function is likely related to the conditionals and the comparison being made in the function. Based on the runtime input/output values, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the conditionals and comparisons of the 'stdout' variable.

The buggy function is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database, and it is using the 'stdout' variable to capture the output of the hive commands. However, the conditions and comparisons used are not effectively determining the existence of the table.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the conditional checks based on the hive command outputs and adjust the return values accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version, the 'stdout' variable is split by newline characters to accurately check if the 'table' exists in the output. Additionally, the conditional checks are simplified to return a boolean value based on the presence of output in 'stdout'. This addresses the bug and provides a more accurate and reliable check for table existence in the database.
